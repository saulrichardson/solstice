  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart showing influenza vaccination dose recommendations for children aged 6 months through 8 years based on prior receipt of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022, indicating 1 or 2 doses of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine, alongside adjacent text discussing study findings on immunogenicity and waning against influenza A(H1N1) and B viruses. The image provides vaccination scheduling guidance and general immunogenicity observations for standard influenza vaccines but contains no data on Flublok\u2019s hemagglutinin content or direct comparison of HA antigen doses; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear but unrelated to Flublok antigen content or immunogenicity comparisons.",
