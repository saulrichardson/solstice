  "explanation": "A tabular list of various quadrivalent influenza vaccines (egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose), showing trade names (e.g., Afluria, Fluarix, Flulaval, Fluzone, Flucelvax), presentations (0.5-mL PFS, MDV, SDV), age indications, antigen content per dose (\u00b5g HA per strain), administration route, and thimerosal content. The table does not mention Flublok or describe antigenic matching with WHO- or FDA-selected strains and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image appears complete for listed vaccines but does not include Flublok; no relevant matching information present.",
