  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza vaccine presentations: standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent vaccines, cell culture\u2013based vaccines, and high-dose egg-based vaccines. Columns include vaccine name/manufacturer, presentation volume, age indication, hemagglutinin antigen content per virus per dose, administration route, and thimerosal content. The table only provides formulation details (dose volumes and antigen amounts) for different vaccines and does not present any data on antibody responses or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to read the table, but no immunogenicity or comparative antibody data are included.",
