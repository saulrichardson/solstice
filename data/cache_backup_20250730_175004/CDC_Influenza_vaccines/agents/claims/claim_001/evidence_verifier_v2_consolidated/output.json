      "explanation": "The quote 'Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5 mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM' appears in the document as 'Flublok Quad rival ent (San of i Pasteur) 0.5 mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM'. The wording is slightly altered due to OCR artifacts, but the factual content, including the product name, manufacturer, dose, age indication, and HA content, is preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok Quadrivalent contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL dose found in standard-dose flu vaccines, as shown elsewhere in the document (e.g., '15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL' for other vaccines). Therefore, the quote supports the first part of the claim regarding HA content. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim about greater immunogenicity, but it does fully support the HA content comparison.",

      "explanation": "The quote 'Fluzone Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS \u22656 mos 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM' is present in the document, though with minor formatting differences due to OCR artifacts.

The quote provides the HA antigen content for a standard-dose flu vaccine (Fluzone Quadrivalent: 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL). The document also lists Flublok Quadrivalent as containing 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL. This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines. While the quote itself does not address immunogenicity, it does substantiate the '3x antigen content' portion of the claim.",
