  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A screenshot of the title and opening of an original article, including a line in the abstract stating, \u201ctrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines, and the recombinant strain is less susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.\u201d Evidence: trivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines The image shows that recombinant influenza vaccines have three times the hemagglutinin content of standard-dose egg-based vaccines but does not provide any data or statements linking this to greater immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim in its entirety Note: Evidence of antigen content is clear, but no information on immunogenicity is visible",
