  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting primary and secondary clinical outcomes comparing two vaccine groups (Flublok vs standard-dose influenza vaccine), including number of PCR-confirmed influenza cases per 1000, unadjusted and adjusted rate/hazard ratios, vaccine effectiveness percentages, and P values. The table displays clinical effectiveness outcomes and statistical comparisons but does not provide information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity measures, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table does not mention antigen dose or immunogenicity endpoints; conclusions about HA content cannot be drawn from these clinical outcome data.",
