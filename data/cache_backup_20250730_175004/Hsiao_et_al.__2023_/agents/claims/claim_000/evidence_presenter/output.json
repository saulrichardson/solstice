  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",

      "quote": "BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the following form: 'BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' This matches the quoted text in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').. The quote directly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines, which supports the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. While the quote does not explicitly mention immunogenicity, it provides the factual basis (higher HA content) that is linked to greater immunogenicity in the claim. Therefore, it supports the claim as far as the document provides explicit information."

      "quote": "During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accord with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 10 of the document, with only minor differences in wording. The document states: 'During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accord with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.' This matches the quote in meaning and technical content.. The quote directly links the observed greater effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine (Flublok) to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen, stating that the benefit is 'in accord with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.' This supports the claim that increased HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity and effectiveness compared to standard-dose flu vaccines. The document also confirms earlier that Flublok contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose vaccines, further substantiating the claim."
