      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by stating that the improved immune response (greater immunogenicity) of recombinant and high-dose vaccines compared to standard-dose vaccines has been observed in studies, directly linking higher antigen content to greater immunogenicity."
