  "explanation": "A two-panel schematic comparing structural features of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) proteins: panel a shows native HA1/HA2 heterodimer with complex-type glycans and cleaved fusion peptide; panel b shows recombinant HA (HA0) monomer from insect cells with simpler paucimannose glycans and uncleaved fusion-peptide loop. Both diagrams include external, membrane, and internal labels and glycan cartoons. The figure presents structural glycosylation and cleavage details of influenza HA proteins and does not mention Flublok, Fluarix, or any clinical trial comparisons, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The figure is a mechanistic structural schematic without any clinical trial or vaccine comparison data.",
