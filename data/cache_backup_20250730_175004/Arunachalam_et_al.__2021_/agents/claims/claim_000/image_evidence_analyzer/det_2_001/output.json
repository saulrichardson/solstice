  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flowchart showing the recombinant production and purification process of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) using a baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system for the manufacture of RIV4, including steps: cloning of full-length cDNA into a baculovirus vector, cell seeding and infection, bioreactor expansion, harvest (disc-stack centrifugation), extraction, depth filtration (clarification), chromatographic capture and purification, DNA removal, and tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure presents the manufacturing workflow for HA protein production and purification but provides no information on antigenic matching or alignment with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear; steps are fully visible. No data or statements regarding strain selection or antigenic equivalence are present.",
