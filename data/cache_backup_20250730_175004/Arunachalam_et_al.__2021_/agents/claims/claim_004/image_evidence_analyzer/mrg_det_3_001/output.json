  "explanation": "A two-panel schematic showing structural features of native influenza hemagglutinin (HA) (panel a) versus recombinant HA (rHA) produced in insect cells (panel b). Panel a illustrates the HA1 and HA2 subunits linked by a disulfide bond with complex-type sialylated N-linked glycans and cleaved fusion peptide. Panel b shows a single HA0 precursor with uncleaved fusion peptide loop and simpler paucimannose glycans. The image depicts structural glycosylation and cleavage differences between native HA and insect cell\u2013derived rHA but provides no data on vaccine dosing or antibody responses, and therefore does not support the claim.",
