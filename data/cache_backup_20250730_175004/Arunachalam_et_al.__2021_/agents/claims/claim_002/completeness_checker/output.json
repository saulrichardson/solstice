      "quote": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",

      "quote": "Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.",

The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.",

      "quote": "The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that egg- or cell-based vaccine production carries a risk of the virus acquiring adaptive mutations, which recombinant DNA technology avoids, directly supporting the claim about mutation risk in traditional vaccine platforms.",

However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26.",
