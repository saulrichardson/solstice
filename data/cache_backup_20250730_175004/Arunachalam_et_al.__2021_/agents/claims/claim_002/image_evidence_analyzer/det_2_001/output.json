  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic figure illustrating the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system for manufacturing a recombinant influenza HA vaccine (RIV4). It shows molecular cloning of HA into a baculovirus vector under a polyhedrin promoter, infection of insect cells in a bioreactor, harvest by centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration for clarification, chromatographic capture and purification including DNA removal, followed by tangential flow filtration and formulation. The figure details the recombinant HA production process in insect cells and does not mention mutations arising during cell- or egg-based vaccine production, so it does not support the claim that such vaccines develop mutations that may reduce effectiveness. Note: Figure is clear and focused on production workflow; no mutation or effectiveness data are presented.",
