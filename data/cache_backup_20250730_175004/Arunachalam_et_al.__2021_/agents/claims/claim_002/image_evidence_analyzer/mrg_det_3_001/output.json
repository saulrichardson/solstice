  "explanation": "Diagrams (panels a and b) of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein structures: (a) native HA extracted from influenza virus shown as HA1 and HA2 heterodimer with cleaved fusion peptide and complex-type sialylated N-linked glycans; (b) recombinant HA (rHA) expressed in insect cells as uncleaved HA0 with uncleaved fusion-peptide loop and simpler paucimannose N-linked glycans. does not support the claim because the figure illustrates structural and glycosylation differences between native viral HA and recombinant insect-cell\u2013derived HA, but does not show or mention mutations arising during egg- or cell-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness.",
