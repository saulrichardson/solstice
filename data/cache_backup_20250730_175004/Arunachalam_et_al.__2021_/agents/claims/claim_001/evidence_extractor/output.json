      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim."

      "quote": "A plant derived recombinant quadrivalent VLP (QVLP) at 30 \u00b5g dose per strain was found to be non inferior in terms of vaccine efficacy against respiratory illness and influenza like illness to a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quadrivalent, GlaxoSmithKline) given at 15 \u00b5g dose strain in adults aged 18 to 64 years 37.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides a direct comparison of immunogenicity between a higher HA dose (30 \u00b5g) and the standard 15 \u00b5g dose, showing that increased HA content is associated with at least non-inferior (and potentially greater) immunogenicity, supporting the link between higher HA content and immunogenicity."

      "quote": "Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) elicits higher antibody responses than standard-dose split vaccines, supporting the claim that greater HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines.",

      "quote": "Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64.",
