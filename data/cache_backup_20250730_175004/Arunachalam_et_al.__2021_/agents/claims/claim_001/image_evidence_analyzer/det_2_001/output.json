  "block_id": "det_2_001",
  "claim_id": "claim_001",
  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic process flow diagram of the baculovirus-insect cell expression system for manufacturing recombinant HA (RIV4), showing steps such as cloning of HA gene into expression vector, cell seeding and infection in a bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, clarification by depth filtration, capture and purification steps including DNA removal, and final TFF/formulation. The figure only depicts the manufacturing process for recombinant HA and does not present any data on antigen content or comparisons with standard-dose flu vaccines; it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to identify process steps but contains no quantitative antigen content or immunogenicity information.",
