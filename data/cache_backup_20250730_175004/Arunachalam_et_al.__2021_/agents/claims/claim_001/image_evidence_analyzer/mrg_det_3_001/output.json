  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic comparing structural features of native influenza hemagglutinin (HA) expressed on virus (HA1 and HA2 subunits, cleaved fusion peptide, complex-type sialylated N-linked glycans) versus recombinant HA0 produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system (single HA0 precursor, uncleaved fusion peptide loop, simpler pauci-mannose glycans). The figure illustrates molecular and glycosylation differences between native HA and recombinant HA0 but provides no information on antigen dosage or comparative HA content; it does not support the claim. Note: None",
