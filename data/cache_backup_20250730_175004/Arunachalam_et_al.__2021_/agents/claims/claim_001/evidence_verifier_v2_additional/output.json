The factual content, technical terms, and meaning are preserved, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) elicits higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody responses against HA1 compared to standard-dose split vaccines derived from eggs or mammalian cells. This supports the claim that Flublok's higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. The quote also references the need for further studies to determine if this broader antibody response underlies observed cross-protection, which aligns with the claim's focus on immunogenicity.",
