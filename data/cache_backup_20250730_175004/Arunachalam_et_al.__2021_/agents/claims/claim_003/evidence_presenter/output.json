      "quote": "Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64. Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, though with some minor differences in formatting and sentence structure due to OCR cleanup. The key factual content is present: Portnoff et al. demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4) induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg-derived split vaccines. The document also states that Richards et al. examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg-derived split vaccine, cell-derived split vaccine, or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons, and that RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. The explanation about simpler glycosylation and absence of other viral proteins contributing to the robust immune response is also present.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides explicit evidence that recombinant technology (RIV4) leads to a broader immune response, as shown by higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies and more robust T-cell and antibody responses compared to conventional vaccines. The mention of antibodies against highly conserved regions and the discussion of features relevant to long-term immunity and vaccine efficacy further support the idea of potential cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. No inference beyond the document is required."

      "quote": "RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenic ally drifted A/H3 N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3 N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3 N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3 N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of aglycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor formatting and OCR differences. The factual content, including the study by Belongia et al., the comparison of RIV4 to HD-IIV3 and aIIV3, the testing against four A/H3N2 viruses (including drifted strains), the geometric mean fold rise, and the seroconversion association (p = 0.003), are all present and semantically equivalent to the provided quote.. The quote directly supports the claim. It describes a clinical study in which RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) induced broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. It provides specific evidence that RIV4 led to higher antibody responses and seroconversion rates to drifted strains compared to conventional vaccines, even when post-vaccination titres were generally low. The investigators' interpretation, as quoted, links these findings to the unique properties of recombinant technology, supporting the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection, even in mismatch seasons."

      "quote": "In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutralising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording (e.g., 'haem agglutinin' vs 'haemagglutinin', 'Flucelvax [Trivalent]' vs 'Flucelvax [Trivalent]', and some punctuation/spacing differences). The factual content, numbers, and technical details are preserved. The passage reads: 'In a study by Nach bag auer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutral ising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haem agglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epi topes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flu cel vax [Trivalent] 77. Higher magnitudes of haem agglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flu cel vax Tetra, Seq i rus, and Flu zone quad rival ent SD, San of i Pasteur 60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.' This matches the quote to be verified.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides evidence that RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) induces neutralising antibodies against multiple influenza subtypes (H1, H3, B), including both stem and head regions, and at higher levels than conventional vaccines. It also notes that these responses are observed in both humans and mice, and that higher antibody responses are seen compared to traditional vaccines. The quote explicitly raises the possibility that this broader antibody repertoire may underlie the cross-protection against antigenic drift variants (i.e., mismatched strains) observed in clinical trials. Thus, the quote substantiates the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season."

      "quote": "The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross protection against mismatched influenza strains 12 75. The study by Nachbagauer et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent influenza viruses similar to the multiple A/H3 N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82. Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against influenza.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 6 of the document, with only minor differences in wording and formatting. The factual content, technical details, and references are preserved.

This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant technology (specifically rHA produced in insect cells) leads to a broader immune response, referencing the higher accessibility of conserved stem regions and the resulting cross-protection against mismatched influenza strains. It also cites studies supporting increased broadly neutralising antibody titres and the potential for greater breadth of protection, even in the context of antigenic drift or mismatch. Thus, the quote provides direct, explicit support for the claim."

      "quote": "The evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional approaches. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process impurities such as inactivating agents or residual egg protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza and or COVID-19.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 6 of the document, starting with 'The evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional approaches...' and continuing through to '...could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza and or COVID-19.' The wording is nearly identical to the provided quote, with only minor formatting and line break differences, but all factual content and technical details are preserved.. The quote explicitly states that recombinant protein technology (BEVS/RIV4) eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to changes in HA structure from egg or cell adaptation, and describes features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely responsible for generating broad cross-reactive and protective antibodies. It also references direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The quote further notes the potential for cross-protection against constantly evolving variants, which directly supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season."

      "explanation": "The quote appears almost verbatim on page 2 of the document: 'This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the benefits of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epi to pes is critical for imparting cross protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.' The only minor difference is the word 'epitopes' being split as 'epi to pes' due to OCR, but the meaning and all technical content are preserved.. The quote explicitly links recombinant technology (BEVS-derived rHA) to the preservation of conserved epitopes, which is described as critical for imparting cross-protection against evolving and mutating viruses. This directly supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. The quote does not require inference; it directly states the mechanism (preservation of conserved epitopes) and the outcome (cross-protection), thus substantiating the claim."

      "quote": "The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions could provide broader specificity. Antisera raised against simple monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine induced protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76-79.",

It provides mechanistic and experimental evidence that recombinant technology (which produces HA with simpler glycosylation) leads to a broader immune response and superior cross-protection, even in the context of antigenic mismatch. The quote specifically states that antibodies against these conserved regions provide broader specificity, and that simpler glycosylation (a feature of recombinant HA) results in more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross-clade protection.
