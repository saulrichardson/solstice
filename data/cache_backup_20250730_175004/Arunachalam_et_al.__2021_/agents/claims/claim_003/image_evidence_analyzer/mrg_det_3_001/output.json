  "explanation": "Two-panel schematic comparing native influenza hemagglutinin (HA) extracted from virus (panel a) with recombinant HA (rHA) produced in insect cells via baculovirus expression (panel b). Panel a shows HA1 and HA2 subunits linked by a disulfide bond, complex-type sialylated N-linked glycans, and a cleaved fusion peptide. Panel b shows HA0 precursor with HA1/HA2 in one chain, pauci-mannose N-linked glycans, and an uncleaved fusion-peptide loop, illustrating simpler glycans and exposed unique epitopes on rHA. The figure illustrates structural and glycosylation differences between native HA and rHA but presents no data on immune response breadth or cross-protection, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is a schematic of molecular features only; it contains no immunogenicity or cross-protection data. ",
