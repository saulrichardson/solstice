  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing attack rates (n/N and %), number of subjects (n), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals for different influenza strains, comparing Flublok to a comparator (Fluarix Quadrivalent); accompanied by footnotes describing PCR-confirmed cases and study protocol details. The figure provides vaccine efficacy data (attack rates, RR, rVE) but contains no information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain; it does not support the claim. Note: Image appears complete for efficacy data but does not include antigen dosing information; content on HA amounts is not visible.",
