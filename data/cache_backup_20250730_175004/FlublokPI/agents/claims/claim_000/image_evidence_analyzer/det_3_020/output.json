  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

  "explanation": "A table summarizing clinical trial vaccine efficacy data for Flublok, showing numbers of cases, attack rates, vaccine efficacy percentages, and confidence intervals for CDC-defined influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) and culture-confirmed cases, separated into \u2018matched strains\u2019 and \u2018any strain\u2019 categories, with footnotes on sequencing, antigenic characterization, and analysis populations. The figure presents efficacy outcomes against influenza-like illness and culture-confirmed cases, but it does not include any information on the process or data demonstrating that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; no mention of WHO or FDA strain matching in the image.",
