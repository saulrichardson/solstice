  "explanation": "A table displaying percentages of subjects reporting solicited adverse events (e.g., fever, with values like <1%, 1%, 2%, 3%, etc.) and footnotes defining severity grades and describing study details for studies 3 and 4 under National Clinical Trials. The table only presents safety and adverse event data for the study vaccine and contains no information on antigenic matching or strain selection, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Partial view of the table; no antigen match data is visible.",
