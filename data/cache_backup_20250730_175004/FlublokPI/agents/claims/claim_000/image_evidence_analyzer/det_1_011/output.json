  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing percentages of solicited local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) in Flublok and control groups, with accompanying footnotes explaining cohort sizes, fever definitions, and trial design. The table presents safety and reactogenicity data and contains no information about antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image quality is sufficient; content is limited to adverse event data and trial footnotes, with no mention of antigenic match.",
