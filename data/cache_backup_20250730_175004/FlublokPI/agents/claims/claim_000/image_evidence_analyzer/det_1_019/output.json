  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of percentage rates of solicited adverse events (any, moderate, severe) reported by subjects in clinical studies of an influenza vaccine, broken down by study arm and symptom severity. The table presents safety data on adverse event frequencies and does not provide any information regarding antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to see that the content is safety/adverse event data only; no antigenic or strain match information is present.",
