The relevant passage is: 'Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine.

See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.' This matches the quote to verify in all substantive details.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine) demonstrated 44.8% efficacy against influenza strains that were not antigenically matched to the vaccine, as 96% of isolates were mismatched. This provides explicit evidence that the vaccine provided cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim. The quote does not discuss the mechanism (broader immune response), but it does provide the outcome (cross-protection in a mismatch season) that the claim asserts.",
