  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table reporting clinical efficacy of the recombinant HA vaccine Flublok Quadrivalent in preventing culture-confirmed influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI). Data are stratified by matched vaccine strains and by any strain regardless of match, with numbers of cases, event rates per 100 person-years, vaccine efficacy percentages (VE), and 95% confidence intervals. Evidence: Efficacy against any strain regardless of match was 44.6% (95% CI 18.8, 62.6). The table shows modest VE against mismatched strains but provides no head-to-head comparison with non-recombinant vaccines or direct immunogenicity data to demonstrate broader immune response; therefore it does not support the claim Note: Lacks direct immunologic breadth data and comparator arm; CI for some subgroups are wide",
