  "explanation": "A table reporting the percentages of subjects experiencing severe responses or solicited adverse events (<1% to single\u2010digit percentages) in Studies 3 and 4 of a U.S.-licensed IIV3, followed by footnotes defining severity grades, trial registration numbers, and fever temperature ranges. does not support the claim because the table presents only safety/reactogenicity data without any immunogenicity or cross-protection results. Note: Image quality is sufficient to see only adverse event data; no immunologic response or mismatch season efficacy information is provided.",
