  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A table comparing RT-PCR\u2013confirmed influenza attack rates and calculated relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) between a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) and a U.S.-licensed egg-based quadrivalent vaccine (Fluarix) across influenza subtypes (A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B lineages). Columns include attack rates (n/N and %), relative risk (RR), and rVE with 95% confidence intervals. Evidence: Positive rVE values against multiple influenza subtypes during a season with antigenic mismatch (e.g., rVE 30% [10\u201347] for H3N2, 36% [14\u201353] for H1N1, and 43% [21\u201359] for one B lineage). The table demonstrates that the recombinant vaccine provided statistically significant protection against mismatched strains, supports the claim that recombinant technology induces broader immune responses conferring cross-protection even in a mismatch season. Note: Portion of figure text is cut off; full context (e.g., season specifics) is inferred from table headers and footnotes.",
