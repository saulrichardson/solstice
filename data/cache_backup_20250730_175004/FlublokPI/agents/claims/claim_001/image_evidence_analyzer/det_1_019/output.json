  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A clinical study table showing percentages of subjects reporting solicited adverse reactions (Any, Moderate, Severe) for various symptoms, with footnotes describing rounding rules and study vaccine groups (e.g., U.S.-licensed IIV3 and study vaccines). The table contains safety data on solicited adverse reactions and does not provide any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The visible portion of the image is clear, but it only presents adverse event rates and lacks any data on HA content or immunogenicity measures.",
