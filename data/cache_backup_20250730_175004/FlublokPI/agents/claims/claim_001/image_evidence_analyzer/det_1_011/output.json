  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, fever) reported in Flublok and comparator/placebo groups from clinical trials, with footnotes describing cohort definitions, trial registration numbers, denominators, severity grading, and demographics. does not support the claim because the image presents safety/reactogenicity data only and does not include any information on HA antigen content or immunogenicity comparisons. Note: The table is clear in its focus on adverse events; antigen dose and immunogenicity data are not shown, limiting relevance to the claim.",
