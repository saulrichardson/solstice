  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Portion of a tabular presentation of adverse event data (percentages of severe responses and fever grades) from clinical studies, with footnotes explaining reporting thresholds (e.g., results \u22651% or <1%), subject definitions, study identifiers, and temperature grading criteria. The image only displays safety/adverse event data and footnotes; it does not present any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or dosage comparisons, and therefore does not support the claim Note: The visible portion of the table is focused on reactogenicity percentages and lacks any mention of HA antigen content; the image is somewhat cropped and may not show dosage information if it occurs elsewhere off-screen",
