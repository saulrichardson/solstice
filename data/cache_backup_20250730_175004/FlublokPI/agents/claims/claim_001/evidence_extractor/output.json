      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile, clear, colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. ... For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, or 45 mcg HA per strain, which is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim."
