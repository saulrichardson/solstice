  "explanation": "A table summarizing the percentage of subjects reporting solicited adverse events and fever grades in two clinical studies of influenza vaccines, with footnotes defining severity and subject populations. The table presents safety and adverse event data from clinical studies and does not address vaccine production methods, viral mutations, or impact on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for the presented data, but it contains no information on production-related mutations or vaccine effectiveness.",
