  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting percentages of subjects reporting severe responses (all <1% to 6%) across different studies of influenza vaccines, with footnotes defining severity grades, population denominators, and study registration details. does not support the claim because the table contains only safety/adverse event data and provides no information on antibody levels, cross-reactivity, or comparisons between BEVS-produced and egg-derived vaccines Note: The visible portion of the table is focused on adverse event incidence; no immunogenicity or antibody response data are shown",
