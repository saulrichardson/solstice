  "explanation": "A table summarizing clinical trial efficacy data for Flublok Quadrivalent versus placebo, showing numbers of cases, attack rates, relative risks, vaccine efficacy percentages, and confidence intervals for CDC-defined influenza-like illness and culture-confirmed influenza (all strains and by subtype). Footnotes describe trial populations and endpoints. does not support the claim because the table presents clinical efficacy outcomes rather than data on antibody levels, cross-reactivity, or responses to conserved HA regions comparing BEVS-derived and egg-derived vaccines Note: The image does not include immunogenicity or antibody cross-reactivity data; conclusions are limited to efficacy endpoints.",
