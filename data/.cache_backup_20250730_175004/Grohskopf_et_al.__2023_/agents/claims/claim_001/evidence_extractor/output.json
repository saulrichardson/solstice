      "quote": "Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines). The adjuvanted vaccine contains 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59. HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote confirms the 3x HA content in Flublok (RIV4) compared to standard-dose vaccines and states that higher dose vaccines, including RIV (Flublok), have shown relative benefit (greater immunogenicity) compared with standard-dose vaccines in certain studies."

      "quote": "Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66\u201368) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code\u2013defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69\u201379). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations. The size of this relative benefit has varied from season to season and is not seen in all studies in all seasons, making it difficult to generalize the findings to all or most seasons.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that RIV (Flublok) has been linked to greater immunogenicity and clinical benefit compared to standard-dose flu vaccines, as shown in certain observational studies."

This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell-derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
