      "quote": "Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 9 of the document: 'Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines).' The numbers and facts match the quote to verify: HD-IIV4 (60 \u00b5g), RIV4 (45 \u00b5g), and standard dose (15 \u00b5g).. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by stating that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus, which is 3 times the 15 \u00b5g in standard-dose flu vaccines. The quote also refers to these as 'higher dose vaccines,' which is consistent with the claim's context. The second part of the claim, about greater immunogenicity, is supported elsewhere in the document (page 14), which states that 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies,' and that these are 'higher dose vaccines.' Thus, the quote and the surrounding context in the document substantiate both the factual content and the implied link to greater immunogenicity."

It states that RIV (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus, which is 3 times the 15 \u00b5g in standard-dose inactivated vaccines, confirming the first part of the claim. It also states that HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, which supports the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity (relative benefit) versus standard-dose flu vaccines. The quote is explicit and does not require inference."

      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 21 of the document under the section 'Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4)'. The text states: 'One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022\u201323 influenza season.

This matches the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent'), but all facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose. This is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g per virus in standard-dose flu vaccines, as shown elsewhere in the document (e.g., Table 1 and related text). This directly supports the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not itself state that this higher HA content 'has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.' That linkage is supported elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 14: 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies...'), but not in the quote itself. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim (the 3x HA content), and the document as a whole supports the second part, but the quote alone does not. Since the task is to verify if the quote supports the claim, and the claim is two-part, the quote directly and explicitly supports the first part and provides the factual basis for the second part, which is substantiated elsewhere in the document."

This matches the quote to be verified, with only minor formatting differences and no substantive factual differences.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus in a 0.5-mL dose. Earlier in the document (Table 1 and related text), it is established that standard-dose flu vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus. Therefore, the quote provides direct evidence that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines. While the quote itself does not state that this higher antigen content 'has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines,' the document elsewhere (page 14) discusses that higher dose vaccines, including RIV4, have shown relative benefit compared with standard-dose IIVs in certain studies. Thus, the quote, in the context of the document, supports the claim as stated."
