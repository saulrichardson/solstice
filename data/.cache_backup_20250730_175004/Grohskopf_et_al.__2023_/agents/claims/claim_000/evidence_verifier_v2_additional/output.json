One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",

      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 21 of the document under the section 'Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine.' The text states: 'One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years.

This matches the quote to be verified, with only minor formatting differences and no substantive factual differences.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus in a 0.5-mL dose. Earlier in the document (Table 1 and related text), it is established that standard-dose flu vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus. Therefore, the quote provides direct evidence that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines. While the quote itself does not state that this higher antigen content 'has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines,' the document elsewhere (page 14) discusses that higher dose vaccines, including RIV4, have shown relative benefit compared with standard-dose IIVs in certain studies. Thus, the quote, in the context of the document, supports the claim as stated.",

The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus, which is 3 times the 15 \u00b5g in standard-dose inactivated vaccines, confirming the first part of the claim. It also states that HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, which addresses the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity.
