  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various licensed influenza vaccines (standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose, adjuvanted, recombinant HA, and live attenuated), their presentations, age indications, HA antigen content per dose, route of administration, and \u00b5g per mL. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA vaccine) is listed with 45 \u00b5g HA per 0.5 mL dose, while standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent vaccines are listed with 15 \u00b5g HA per 0.5 mL dose. The table clearly shows Flublok contains three times the HA antigen content of standard-dose vaccines but provides no data or reference linking this higher content to greater immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim about immunogenicity. Note: The table does not include any immunogenicity or efficacy outcomes, only antigen content per dose.",
