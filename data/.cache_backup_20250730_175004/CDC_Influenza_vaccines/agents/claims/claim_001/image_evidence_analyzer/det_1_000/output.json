  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccines by trade name and manufacturer, presentation volume, age indication, HA antigen content per dose (\u03bcg/0.5 mL or virus count), route of administration, and mercury content. It includes standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent vaccines with 15 \u03bcg HA per virus per 0.5 mL dose and Flublok Quadrivalent with 45 \u03bcg HA per 0.5 mL dose. Evidence: Table shows Flublok Quadrivalent contains 45 \u03bcg HA per 0.5 mL dose compared to standard-dose vaccines at 15 \u03bcg HA per 0.5 mL dose. The table does not support the claim in full because, although it demonstrates that Flublok contains three times the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, it does not provide any data or evidence linking this higher antigen content to greater immunogenicity. Therefore, it doesn't support the claim regarding immunogenicity.",
