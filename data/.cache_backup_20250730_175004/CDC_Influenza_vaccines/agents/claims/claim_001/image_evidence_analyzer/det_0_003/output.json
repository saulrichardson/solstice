  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products by category (standard-dose egg-based vaccines, standard-dose cell culture\u2013based vaccine, high-dose egg-based vaccine) with columns for presentation, age indication, hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per virus per dose (e.g., 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL, 60 \u00b5g/0.7 mL), route of administration, and thimerosal content. The image does not support the claim because it does not include any data on Flublok or show that any vaccine contains three times the HA antigen content of standard-dose vaccines. Note: Portion of the table potentially containing Flublok (RIV4) information is not visible in the image; no direct evidence of Flublok antigen content is present.",
