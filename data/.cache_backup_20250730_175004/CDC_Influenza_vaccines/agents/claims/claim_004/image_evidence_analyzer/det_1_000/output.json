  "explanation": "Table listing quadrivalent influenza vaccine formulations, including inactivated (IIV4), recombinant (RIV4), and live attenuated (LAIV4) vaccines. Columns show trade name and manufacturer (e.g., Fluad Quadrivalent [Seqirus], Flublok Quadrivalent [Sanofi Pasteur], FluMist Quadrivalent [AstraZeneca]), presentation format (prefilled syringe or intranasal sprayer), age indications, antigen content per dose (\u00b5g HA for IIV4 and RIV4, fluorescent focus units for LAIV4), route of administration, and mercury content if present. The table does not include any data on antibody responses or immunogenicity; it only lists antigen doses and formulations, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image clearly shows only formulation details; no immunogenicity or antibody titre data are present.",
