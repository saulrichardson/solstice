  "explanation": "A phylogenetic tree of influenza A(H3N2) hemagglutinin sequences, showing six genetic clusters (A\u2013F) representing distinct clades (e.g., 3C.2a1, 3C.3a) with vaccine strains placed on the tree and sampling over multiple seasons. The figure presents a genetic phylogeny of influenza strains and does not include any data or statements about recombinant vaccine technology, immune response breadth, or cross-protection, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and depicts only genetic relationships; no immunogenicity or vaccine platform information is provided.",
