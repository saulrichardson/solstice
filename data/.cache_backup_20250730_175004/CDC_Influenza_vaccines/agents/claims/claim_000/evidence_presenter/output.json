      "explanation": "A slide showing a comparison between traditional egg-based flu vaccines and recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) vaccines (Flublok). The left panel illustrates how egg adaptation can introduce antigenic changes in HA, while the right panel depicts Flublok\u2019s recombinant production of HA that maintains the exact amino acid sequence of the WHO/FDA-recommended reference strain. Evidence: The image explicitly states that recombinant HA (Flublok) has an amino acid sequence identical to the WHO/FDA reference strain, indicating no egg-adapted mutations. The figure demonstrates that Flublok\u2019s recombinant HA matches the WHO/FDA-selected strain exactly, with no egg-induced antigenic changes, which supports the claim. Note: Image is somewhat low resolution; conclusions based solely on visible text and schematics."
