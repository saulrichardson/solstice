  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular list of seasonal influenza vaccine products, including egg-based standard-dose quadrivalent IIV4 vaccines, a cell culture\u2013based quadrivalent vaccine (Flucelvax), a high-dose egg-based vaccine, and an egg-based adjuvanted vaccine. The table specifies presentations (e.g., prefilled syringe, multi-dose vial), age indications, antigen content per dose, administration route, and thimerosal content. The table provides product names, formulations, dosages, age indications, and thimerosal content, but it contains no information regarding mutations arising during production or impacts on vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim.",
