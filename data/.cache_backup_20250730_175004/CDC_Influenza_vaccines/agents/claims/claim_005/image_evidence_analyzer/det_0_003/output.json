  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing U.S. licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines (standard-dose egg-based, cell culture-based, and high-dose products), including brand names, presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe, multidose vial), age indications, antigen content per dose, administration route, and thimerosal content. Brands shown include Flulaval Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent. The table only provides vaccine characteristics and does not mention a pivotal trial or a direct comparison of Flublok to Fluarix, so it does not support the claim. Note: No information about clinical trial comparators is present; the image focuses on product specifications.",
