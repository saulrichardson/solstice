      "explanation": "A CONSORT\u2010style flow diagram showing adult participants randomized into two arms: one receiving Flublok quadrivalent and the other receiving Fluarix quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine. Participants are stratified by age group (18\u201349 years and \u226550 years) with numbers per arm shown. Evidence: The diagram explicitly labels one arm as \u201cFlublok quadrivalent\u201d and the other as \u201cFluarix quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine,\u201d indicating a direct head-to-head comparison in the pivotal trial. The image supports the claim because it shows that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) in the pivotal trial. Note: Image resolution is low and some text is small, but the key vaccine names and trial arms are legible."
