The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, spacing, and the presence of the word 'unadjuvanted'). All key facts and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose per strain. This is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines, thus supporting the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the claim about antigen content, but not the immunogenicity aspect. Since the task is to verify if the quote supports the claim, and the claim is two-part, the quote supports the first part explicitly and provides the necessary factual basis for the '3x HA content' assertion.",
