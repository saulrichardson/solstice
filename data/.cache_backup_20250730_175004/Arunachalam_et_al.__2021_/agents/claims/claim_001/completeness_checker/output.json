      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides a direct comparison of immunogenicity between a higher HA dose (30 \u00b5g) and the standard 15 \u00b5g dose, showing that increased HA content is associated with at least non-inferior (and potentially greater) immunogenicity, supporting the link between higher HA content and immunogenicity."

RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines.",

The rHA contained in RIV4 differs from that expressed in other systems in terms of specific structural features, the nature of the source material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on certain aspects of vaccine safety and efficacy (Fig. 2). Based on these unique features RIV4 received 'product exclusivity' protection in the USA, Canada, and Europe.
