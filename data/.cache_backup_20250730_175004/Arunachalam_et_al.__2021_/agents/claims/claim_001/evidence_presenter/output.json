      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, spacing, and the presence of the word 'unadjuvanted'). All key facts and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose per strain. This is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines, thus supporting the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the claim about antigen content, but not the immunogenicity aspect. Since the task is to verify if the quote supports the claim, and the claim is two-part, the quote supports the first part explicitly and provides the necessary factual basis for the '3x HA content' assertion."

      "quote": "Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document: 'Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65.

The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (RIV4) is linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. It reports that RIV4 elicited significantly higher T-cell and antibody responses than both egg-derived and cell-derived split vaccines in a comparative study. While the quote does not explicitly mention the 3x HA antigen content, it does provide direct evidence of greater immunogenicity, which is the key point of the claim."

      "quote": "Insect cell derived rHA (RIV4) has been studied extensively by various groups in both pre clinical models and humans. The rHA contained in RIV4 differs from that expressed in other systems in terms of specific structural features, the nature of the source material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on certain aspects of vaccine safety and efficacy (Fig. 2). Based on these unique features RIV4 received 'product exclusivity' protection in the USA, Canada, and Europe. RIV4 contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, which is three times the amount of HA present in standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (15 \u00b5g per strain).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 3 of the document, with only minor differences in wording and formatting. The key factual content is present: 'Insect cell derived rHA (RIV4) has been studied extensively by various groups in both pre clinical models and humans.

RIV4 contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, which is three times the amount of HA present in standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (15 \u00b5g per strain).' The meaning and data are preserved.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, which is three times the amount found in standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (15 \u00b5g per strain). This substantiates the claim about antigen content. While the quote does not directly state that this higher antigen content is 'linked to greater immunogenicity,' the document elsewhere discusses that higher HA content and unique features of RIV4 are associated with improved immune responses. Therefore, the quote, in the context of the document, supports the claim as it provides the factual basis for the antigen content difference, which is the core of the claim."
