      "quote": "Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording. The factual content is preserved: 'Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65.

Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.' This matches the quote to verify, with all key facts and numbers present.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher antibody (and T-cell) levels than both egg-derived and cell-derived split vaccines in healthy adults over three influenza seasons. This is explicit evidence that the recombinant vaccine induces a more robust antibody response than standard egg-based vaccines, as claimed."

      "quote": "Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document: 'Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64.' The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote provided for verification.. The quote directly compares recombinant HA antigens (as used in RIV4, a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) to egg-derived split vaccines, stating that the recombinant vaccine induced 'significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies.' This supports the claim that vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. The quote is explicit in its comparison and outcome, requiring no inference."

      "quote": "Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor formatting and wording differences: 'Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60).' This matches the provided quote in all substantive details, including the comparison of RIV4 to egg- and cell-derived split vaccines and the observation of higher antibody responses.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (the higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) induces higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines, which are standard-dose. This is a direct comparison of antibody response magnitude between the higher-dose recombinant vaccine and standard egg-based vaccines, thus substantiating the claim without requiring inference."

      "quote": "In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3.",

The factual content is preserved: 'In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion in activated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, SanofiPasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3.' The quote in the document matches the provided quote in all substantive details.. The quote directly supports the claim. It describes a study in which the antibody response (measured as geometric mean fold rise) against two circulating A/H3N2 viruses was twice as high for the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) compared to the high-dose egg-based vaccine (HD-IIV3) and the adjuvanted egg-based vaccine (aIIV3). This provides explicit comparative data showing that the higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose (and even high-dose) vaccines."

The factual content, technical details, and meaning are preserved, with only minor formatting and spacing differences due to OCR correction.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) induces HA stem-specific neutralizing antibodies in humans, with the highest titers in the elderly, and that RIV4 induces antibodies to HA head epitopes at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine. This provides explicit evidence that RIV4 may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based (or cell-based) vaccines, as claimed."
