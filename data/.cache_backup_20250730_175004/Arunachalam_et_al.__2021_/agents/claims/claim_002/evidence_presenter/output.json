      "quote": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor formatting differences. The factual content is preserved: 'POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and line breaks.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that traditional split or subunit influenza vaccines (which are produced in eggs or mammalian cells) have the potential to acquire adaptive mutations in the HA (hemagglutinin) protein during production, and that these mutations may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. This is exactly what the claim asserts: that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness."

      "quote": "Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, in the section titled 'POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE.' The text states: 'Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glut amine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'glut amine' vs 'glutamine'), but all facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example (from Raymond et al.) where an egg-adapted vaccine strain acquired a mutation (glutamine to arginine at position 226) during production. This mutation led to the induction of antibodies that preferentially recognized the vaccine-derived HA rather than the circulating wild type virus, implying a reduction in vaccine effectiveness due to the mutation. This is explicit evidence that mutations can arise during egg-based vaccine production and can reduce effectiveness, thus supporting the claim."

      "quote": "During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document on page 2, in the section discussing potential antigenic mismatch of influenza vaccine virus grown in egg or cells due to adaptive mutations in the HA primary structure. The text states: 'During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156 Q, G186 V, and S219 Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.' The factual content, numbers, and technical details are preserved and match the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example where mutations (H156Q, G186V, and S219Y) developed during egg-based vaccine production, and these mutations were attributed to a reduction in vaccine effectiveness (41%) for H3N2 in the 2012-2013 season. This demonstrates that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness, as stated in the claim."

      "quote": "Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document on page 2: 'Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.' The wording and meaning are preserved, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., citation formatting).. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation during vaccine manufacturing have contributed to reduced vaccine effectiveness for H3N2 in multiple influenza seasons. This directly substantiates the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness."

      "quote": "The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 6 of the document: 'The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and phrasing, but the factual content is preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that egg- or cell-based vaccine production can cause 'potential changes in primary HA structure' (i.e., mutations or adaptations), which can lead to 'antigenic mismatch' and thus reduced effectiveness. It further states that recombinant technology eliminates this risk, confirming that the risk exists for cell- and egg-based vaccines. This is a direct and explicit affirmation of the claim."

      "quote": "The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus.",

This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences (e.g., quotation marks, ''live'' vs 'live').. The quote directly addresses the claim. It states that there is a risk (albeit low due to quality control) of introducing deleterious mutations through adaptation of seed virus during egg- or cell-based vaccine manufacturing, and that recombinant DNA technology avoids this risk because it does not use live virus. This supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."

      "quote": "For the 2016-2017 season, the influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26.

Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26.",

The quote in the document is semantically and factually equivalent to the one provided.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a concrete example where a mutation (loss of a glycosylation site) occurred during egg adaptation of the vaccine virus, resulting in antibodies that poorly neutralized the circulating virus. This demonstrates that egg-based (and by extension, cell-based) flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness, as the claim asserts."
