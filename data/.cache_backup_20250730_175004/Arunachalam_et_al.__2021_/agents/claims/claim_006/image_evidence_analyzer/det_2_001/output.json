  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A schematic diagram showing the baculovirus-insect cell expression system workflow for producing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA), including cloning the HA gene into baculovirus DNA, infecting insect cells, bioreactor expansion, harvest, extraction, clarification, capture, purification, DNA removal, and formulation steps. The caption indicates it\u2019s for manufacture of a recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4). Evidence: Caption and labels explicitly reference the 'baculovirus-insect cell expression system' used to express HA gene, indicating recombinant HA is produced in insect cells using BEVS. The figure supports the claim by explicitly depicting and labeling the use of a baculovirus expression vector system in insect cells to produce recombinant HA, which directly aligns with the described novel production platform for Flublok.",
