RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.",
