RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the claim about antigen content.",

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides context for standard-dose flu vaccines containing 15 \u00b5g HA per strain, which helps establish the comparison that Flublok's 45 \u00b5g HA per strain is three times higher.",
