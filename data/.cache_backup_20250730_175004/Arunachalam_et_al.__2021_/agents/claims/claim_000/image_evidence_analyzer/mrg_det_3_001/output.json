  "explanation": "Side-by-side schematic diagrams of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) structural features: panel a shows native HA1/HA2 heterodimer extracted from virus with complex-type sialylated glycans and cleaved fusion peptide; panel b shows recombinant HA0 precursor produced in insect cells with simpler paucimannose glycans and an uncleaved fusion peptide loop, both anchored in a membrane context. The figure describes glycosylation and precursor processing differences between native HA and recombinant HA0 and notes identical amino acid sequence, but it does not present any data or statements about antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains. Therefore it does not support the claim.",
