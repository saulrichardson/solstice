RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., '\u00b5g' vs 'mcg', 'dose' included, and some parenthetical clarifications), but the factual content is the same.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose from each of the four strains. This matches the claim that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain. While the quote does not explicitly mention the HA content of standard-dose influenza vaccines (15 mcg per strain), it fully substantiates the portion of the claim regarding Flublok's HA content. The comparison to standard-dose vaccines is not contradicted and is commonly known, but the quote itself only directly supports the Flublok part of the claim.",
