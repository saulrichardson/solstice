      "quote": "Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem compared to egg derived split vaccines 64.",
      "explanation": "A semantically equivalent quote appears on page 5: 'Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem compared to egg derived split vaccines 64.' This matches the provided quote in all key factual content, including the comparison of BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens to egg-derived vaccines, the higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies, and the focus on highly conserved regions of HA.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS (as in RIV4) induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem compared to egg-derived split vaccines. This is exactly what the claim asserts, with no need for inference or assumption."
