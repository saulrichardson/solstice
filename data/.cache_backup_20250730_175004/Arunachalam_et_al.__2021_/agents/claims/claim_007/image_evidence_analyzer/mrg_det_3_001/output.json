  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-panel schematic comparing the structural features of native influenza HA (HA1/HA2 heterodimer with complex sialylated N-linked glycans and cleaved fusion peptide) extracted from virus (panel a) versus recombinant HA0 monomer expressed in insect cells via baculovirus (panel b) with paucimannose glycans and uncleaved fusion-peptide loop, showing glycosylation and cleavage differences. The figure illustrates structural and glycosylation differences between egg- or virus-derived HA and BEVS-produced rHA but provides no data on antibody responses or cross-reactivity, and thus does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody titer data are presented; the schematic is clear but limited to structural features.",
