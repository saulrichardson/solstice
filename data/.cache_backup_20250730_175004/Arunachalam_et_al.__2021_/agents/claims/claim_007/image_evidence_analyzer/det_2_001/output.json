  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flow chart illustrating the production of recombinant HA antigen using the baculovirus\u2010insect cell expression system, including steps for cloning the HA gene into a baculovirus transfer vector, generating recombinant baculovirus DNA, infecting insect cell bioreactors, harvesting and extracting the protein, clarification, capture, purification (including DNA removal), and final TFF/formulation. The figure depicts only the manufacturing process for recombinant HA using BEVS and contains no data on antibody responses or comparative immunogenicity versus egg-derived vaccines; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: No quantitative or comparative immunogenicity data are present; only process steps are shown.",
