  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic figure illustrating cluster randomization of Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities by service area and facility size into Block A and Block B, and a table showing weekly alternation of vaccine formulations (SD-IIV4 and RIV4) across 9 facilities over 4 weeks. The image only describes study cluster randomization and weekly assignment of standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) versus recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4). It does not present or quantify hemagglutinin antigen content, so it does not support the claim. Note: Figure is clear but only covers randomization and vaccine assignment; no antigen content or immunogenicity data are shown.",
