  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A forest plot (Figure 3) showing subgroup analyses of relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) of a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose flu vaccine among participants aged 50\u201364, stratified by preexisting conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, and any of these) for endpoints including PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. The figure presents relative effectiveness data comparing recombinant and standard-dose vaccines but contains no information about hemagglutinin antigen content or antigen dosing. Therefore, it does not support the claim regarding Flublok having 3x HA content linked to immunogenicity. Note: No data on antigen content are shown; only effectiveness outcomes are presented.",
