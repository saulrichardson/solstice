This matches the quoted text in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').. The quote directly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines, which supports the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. While the quote does not explicitly mention immunogenicity, it provides the factual basis (higher HA content) that is linked to greater immunogenicity in the claim. Therefore, it supports the claim as far as the document provides explicit information.",

The quote directly links the observed greater effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine (Flublok) to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen, stating that the benefit is 'in accord with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.'
