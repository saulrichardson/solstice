  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table of influenza vaccine efficacy data (CDC\u2010ILI and culture\u2010confirmed cases, attack rates, vaccine efficacy percentages with confidence intervals) alongside footnotes and references, with no mention of antigen (HA) dosage per strain. does not support the claim because the figure only shows efficacy outcomes, case counts, attack rates, and references, and contains no information on micrograms of HA per strain for Flublok or standard\u2010dose vaccines Note: No dosage or formulation details are visible; the image is focused on efficacy data only",
