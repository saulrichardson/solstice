      "quote": "For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the '11 DESCRIPTION' section: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' The factual content, numbers, and technical details are preserved and match the quote to verify.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain for each of the three influenza virus strains, which matches the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain. While the quote does not mention the HA content of standard-dose influenza vaccines (15 mcg per strain), it fully substantiates the part of the claim regarding Flublok's HA content. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as far as Flublok's HA content is concerned."
