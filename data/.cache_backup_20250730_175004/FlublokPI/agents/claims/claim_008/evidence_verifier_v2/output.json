The quote directly states that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain for each of the three influenza virus strains, which matches the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain. While the quote does not mention the HA content of standard-dose influenza vaccines (15 mcg per strain), it fully substantiates the part of the claim regarding Flublok's HA content.
