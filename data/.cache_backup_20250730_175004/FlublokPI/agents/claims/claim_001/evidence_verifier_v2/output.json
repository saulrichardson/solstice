For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' The wording and numbers are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, or 45 mcg HA per strain, which is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines. This is a well-known standard for comparison, and the document provides the necessary numbers to substantiate the '3x' claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim but does not provide evidence for the immunogenicity comparison.",
