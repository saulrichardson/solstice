  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting attack rates (n/N and percentage), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE with 95% CI) comparing Flublok Quadrivalent to a U.S.\u2010licensed seasonal quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent) across different outcomes. The image does not support the claim because it shows efficacy outcomes (attack rates, RR, rVE) and contains no information about the hemagglutinin antigen content or dosage, so it doesn\u2019t support the claim. Note: No antigen content or dosage information is present in the table; analysis limited to what is visible.",
