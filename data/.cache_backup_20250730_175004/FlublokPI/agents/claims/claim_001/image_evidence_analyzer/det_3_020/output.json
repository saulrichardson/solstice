  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine efficacy data from a clinical trial of Flublok, including numbers of culture-confirmed influenza-like illness cases (matched to vaccine strains and all strains), attack rates in vaccine and control groups, percentage vaccine efficacy with 95% confidence intervals, and accompanying footnotes and references. The table shows efficacy outcomes but contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or direct comparison of HA dosages, and therefore does not support the claim Note: The image is clear regarding efficacy data but does not address antigen content; no limitations beyond scope mismatch",
