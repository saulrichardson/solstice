      "quote": "Data from a randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that children 6 months to less than 3 years of age had diminished hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) responses to Flublok compared to a U.S.-licensed influenza vaccine approved for use in this population, strongly suggesting that Flublok would not be effective in children younger than 3 years of age (6).",
      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote references the hemagglutinin (HA) content and immunogenicity of Flublok, specifically noting the immune response (HI responses) in a population, which is directly related to the claim about HA content and immunogenicity."

      "quote": "Data for Flublok Quad rival ent are relevant to Flublok because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.",
      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by establishing that Flublok and Flublok Quadrivalent share the same manufacturing process and composition, which is relevant when considering antigen content and immunogenicity comparisons."
