  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-part table showing vaccine efficacy analyses for Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant) versus a licensed quadrivalent inactivated egg-based influenza vaccine. Columns include number of cases, incidence rates per 100 person\u2010years, vaccine efficacy percentages with 95% confidence intervals for endpoints such as rtPCR\u2010confirmed CDC\u2010defined influenza\u2010like illness (CDC\u2010ILI) and culture-confirmed influenza (all strains, subtype A, subtype B). Footnotes describe populations, analysis methods, and definitions of endpoints. does not support the claim because the table presents clinical efficacy outcomes and not antibody response or immunogenicity data, so it does not address whether a higher-dose recombinant vaccine induces a more robust antibody response than egg-based vaccines. Note: The table is clear but only reports clinical endpoints; no immunogenicity or antibody titer results are shown.",
