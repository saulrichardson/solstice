  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial table showing percentages (e.g., 1, <1, 6, 5, 3, 2) of severe responses reported by subjects across different study groups, with footnotes explaining that results \u22651% are shown and results >0 but <1% are reported as <1%, plus definitions of severity and study descriptions (Studies 3 and 4 with U.S.-licensed IIV3 and IIV4). The table presents safety/reactogenicity data (percentages of severe responses) without any immunogenicity or antibody titer measurements, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table headings are partly cut off and only adverse event data are shown; no information on antibody responses is visible.",
