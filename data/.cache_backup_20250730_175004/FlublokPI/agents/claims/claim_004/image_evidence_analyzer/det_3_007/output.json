  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing influenza attack rates (n/N and percentage), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE% with 95% CI) for recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine versus an egg-based standard-dose comparator across influenza subtypes (A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B Victoria, B Yamagata). The table presents clinical efficacy metrics (attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy) rather than immunogenicity or antibody response data, so it does not support the claim about a more robust antibody response. Note: Limited to clinical efficacy outcomes; immunogenicity data are not shown in the image.",
