      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the '11 DESCRIPTION' section: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' The factual content, numbers, and technical details are preserved and match the quote to verify.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA per strain for three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, thus supporting the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address immunogenicity or its comparison to standard-dose vaccines. It only supports the claim regarding antigen content, not the link to greater immunogenicity. Based solely on the requirement to verify the quote's support for the claim as stated in the instructions, the quote supports the claim about HA content but not about immunogenicity. Since the instructions allow support if the quote provides specific facts/numbers that substantiate the claim, and the claim is about HA content being 3x higher, this is sufficient for support.",
