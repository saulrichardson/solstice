  "explanation": "A table summarizing influenza vaccine efficacy results by strain, showing attack rates (n/N and percentages), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals for different influenza strains compared between Flublok Quadrivalent and a comparator vaccine (Fluarix). does not support the claim because the table presents clinical efficacy data and does not provide any information on antigenic matching or selection of strains by WHO or FDA. Note: Limited to visible portion of the table; no data on antigenic characterization or match criteria are shown.",
