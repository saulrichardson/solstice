SAEs were collected for 6 months post vaccination via clinic visit or remote contact. Study 6 (NCT02285998) enrolled subjects 50 years of age and older, randomized to receive Flublok Quadrivalent or Comparator (Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline) as an active control [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The safety analysis population included 4328 Flublok Quadrivalent recipients and 4344 Comparator vaccine recipients.",
