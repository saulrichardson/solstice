  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table detailing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (percentages) following vaccination in clinical studies, listing symptoms (pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) and their occurrence rates in Flublok and comparator groups, with footnotes describing Study 1 (Flublok vs placebo, NCT00539981) and pooled Studies 2\u20134 (Flublok vs a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine comparator, Fluzone, NCT00395174, etc.). The table presents comparisons of Flublok against placebo and against a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone) but makes no mention of Fluarix quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Footnotes are partially cut off and focus on trivalent vaccine comparators, but no mention of Fluarix quadrivalent is visible.",
