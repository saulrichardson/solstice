  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A clinical trial efficacy table showing Flublok quadrivalent vaccine infection rates versus placebo across various endpoints (culture-confirmed influenza-like illness, CDC-ILI, by strain), with vaccine efficacy percentages and 95% confidence intervals, plus footnotes and references. Evidence: The table only presents Flublok versus placebo infection rates; there is no mention of Fluarix quadrivalent as a comparator in the pivotal trial. The image does not support the claim because it shows Flublok compared only to placebo rather than against Fluarix quadrivalent. Note: Image is clear enough to identify key comparators; no direct evidence of Fluarix in the displayed figure.",
