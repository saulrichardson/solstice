  "explanation": "A table from a clinical document listing pivotal immunogenicity studies of Flublok quadrivalent, including study design details, vaccine formulations, and comparator vaccines. Evidence: The table lists Flublok (quadrivalent) and shows that the comparator vaccine in the pivotal trial was Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine). The table directly shows Flublok (quadrivalent) being evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), which supports the claim Note: Image text is small and somewhat blurred, but the comparator Fluarix QIV is legible.",
