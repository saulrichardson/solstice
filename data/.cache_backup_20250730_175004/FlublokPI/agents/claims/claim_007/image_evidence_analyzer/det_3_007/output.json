  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing attack rates (n/N and %), number of subjects (n), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI) for various groups, with footnotes describing RT-PCR confirmation, comparator vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent), definitions of subjects, and calculation of rVE. The table presents clinical efficacy endpoints (attack rates, RR, rVE) comparing vaccines but does not show data on levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies or comparison of immunogenicity between BEVS-derived recombinant HA antigens and egg-derived vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim Note: The image quality is sufficient to determine that immunogenicity data are not presented; conclusions are limited to what is shown in the table.",
