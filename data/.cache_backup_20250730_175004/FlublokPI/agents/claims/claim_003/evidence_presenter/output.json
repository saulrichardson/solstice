      "quote": "Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 4 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording that do not affect the meaning. The relevant passage is: 'Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.' This matches the quote to verify in all substantive details.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine) demonstrated 44.8% efficacy against influenza strains that were not antigenically matched to the vaccine, as 96% of isolates were mismatched. This provides explicit evidence that the vaccine provided cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim. The quote does not discuss the mechanism (broader immune response), but it does provide the outcome (cross-protection in a mismatch season) that the claim asserts."

The quote directly supports the claim. It states that Flublok showed vaccine efficacy (VE) of 44.8% against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, in subjects with influenza-like illness (ILI). This demonstrates that the recombinant vaccine provided protection even when the circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine, which is evidence of a broader immune response and potential cross-protection in a mismatch season."

      "explanation": "A table comparing RT-PCR\u2013confirmed influenza attack rates and calculated relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) between a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) and a U.S.-licensed egg-based quadrivalent vaccine (Fluarix) across influenza subtypes (A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B lineages). Columns include attack rates (n/N and %), relative risk (RR), and rVE with 95% confidence intervals. Evidence: Positive rVE values against multiple influenza subtypes during a season with antigenic mismatch (e.g., rVE 30% [10\u201347] for H3N2, 36% [14\u201353] for H1N1, and 43% [21\u201359] for one B lineage). The table demonstrates that the recombinant vaccine provided statistically significant protection against mismatched strains, supports the claim that recombinant technology induces broader immune responses conferring cross-protection even in a mismatch season. Note: Portion of figure text is cut off; full context (e.g., season specifics) is inferred from table headers and footnotes."
