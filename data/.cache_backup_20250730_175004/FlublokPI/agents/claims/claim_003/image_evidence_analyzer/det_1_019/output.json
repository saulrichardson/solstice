  "explanation": "A table displaying percentages of solicited adverse events (any, moderate, severe) reported by subjects in multiple studies, with footnotes describing reporting thresholds (\u22651%, <1%) and study details. Data relate to local and systemic reactions (e.g., injection site induration, fever, headache) but no immunogenicity or cross-protection metrics. The table presents safety and tolerability data only and does not support the claim regarding immune response breadth or cross-protection in mismatch seasons Note: No immunogenicity or efficacy data visible; only adverse event reporting is shown",
