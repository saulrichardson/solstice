  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two tables displaying solicited adverse event (reactogenicity) data from clinical trials of Flublok (recombinant influenza vaccine) versus a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine comparator, listing local reactions (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic events (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) with percentages by group. The image provides safety/reactogenicity outcomes only and does not include any immunogenicity, breadth-of-response, or cross-protection data, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The table clearly shows adverse event rates; no information on immune response breadth or efficacy against mismatched strains is present.",
