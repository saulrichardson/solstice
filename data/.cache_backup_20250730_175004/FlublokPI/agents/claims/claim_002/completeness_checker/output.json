      "quote": "Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single dose, pre filled syringes contain no natural rubber latex.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote clarifies that Flublok (a recombinant, cell-based vaccine) does not use eggs in its production, which is relevant because egg-based vaccines are known to potentially develop mutations during production. The explicit mention of the absence of egg proteins sets the context for why Flublok may avoid such mutations, supporting the claim by contrast."

      "quote": "Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year's influenza vaccine.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly addresses the concept of antigenic drift, which includes the development of mutations. It supports the claim by explaining that mutations (antigenic variants) are a known issue in influenza virus evolution, which can occur during vaccine production and impact effectiveness."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that the majority of influenza virus isolates from vaccinated individuals were not antigenically matched to the vaccine strains, which is consistent with the idea that mutations can occur during production, potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness.",
