  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table displaying vaccine efficacy data from clinical studies of the recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent), including the number of cases, attack rates, relative risks, vaccine efficacy percentages for culture-confirmed influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) and any-strain outcomes, along with footnotes on study design, endpoints, and references. The figure presents efficacy results for a recombinant flu vaccine and does not mention cell- or egg-based vaccine production or mutation-related impacts; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to efficacy data; no information on production methods or mutation events is shown.",
