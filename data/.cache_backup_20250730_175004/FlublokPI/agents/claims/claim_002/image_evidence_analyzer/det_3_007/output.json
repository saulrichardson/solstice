  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing RT-PCR\u2013confirmed influenza attack rates, number of cases (n), attack rate percentages, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals for a cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine versus a licensed egg-based comparator. The table presents clinical attack rates, RR, and rVE data comparing a cell-based vaccine to an egg-based vaccine but contains no information on mutations arising during vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible table; no text on production processes or mutations is shown.",
