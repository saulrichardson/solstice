  "explanation": "A two-column table showing percentages of solicited local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) in vaccine and control groups from flu vaccine clinical studies, with footnotes describing data collection methods, cohort definitions, and fever grading. does not support the claim because the table presents reactogenicity (safety) data and contains no information about mutations arising during vaccine production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness.",
