  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table showing percentages of subjects reporting solicited adverse events and severity grading for vaccine studies, with footnotes defining severity grades and mentioning U.S.-licensed IIV3 comparator in Studies 3 and 4. does not support the claim because the image only presents clinical safety data and definitions of adverse event severity; it contains no information on Flublok\u2019s production platform or use of BEVS in insect cells. Note: The image is clear but limited to safety results and does not address manufacturing methods.",
