  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial screenshot of the first page of Flublok\u2019s prescribing information, showing the table of contents and section headings (e.g., Indications and Usage, Dosage and Administration, Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions, Adverse Reactions, Use in Specific Populations, Description, Clinical Pharmacology, Nonclinical Toxicology, Clinical Studies, References, How Supplied/Storage and Handling, Patient Counseling Information). The image only presents the table of contents and section headings of the prescribing information; it does not contain any details on manufacturing or expression systems and therefore doesn't support the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel BEVS insect cell platform. Note: Only the table of contents is visible; the actual Description section where production methods might be detailed is not shown.",
