  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) reported by subjects in Flublok and comparator/placebo groups in clinical trials, with footnotes on denominators, fever definitions, and trial identifiers. does not support the claim because the table contains only safety and reactogenicity data and provides no information on Flublok\u2019s production platform or the use of recombinant HA expression in insect cells via BEVS. Note: Image quality is sufficient to determine content; manufacturing details are absent.",
