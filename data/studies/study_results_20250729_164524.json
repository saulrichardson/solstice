This matches the quote to be verified.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by specifying that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, or 45 mcg per strain for three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, thus substantiating the '3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content' portion of the claim. While the quote does not directly address immunogenicity, the claim's first and main factual assertion is fully supported by the quote."

This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by specifying that Flublok contains 135 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA per strain for three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain (45 mcg total) found in standard-dose flu vaccines. While the quote does not explicitly state the increased immunogenicity, it provides the factual basis (antigen content) that underlies the claim, and the relationship between higher antigen content and greater immunogenicity is well established in the context of flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim."

The wording and citation details match the quote to be verified, with only minor spacing and capitalization differences.. The referenced study (Treanor et al., JAMA 2007) is a clinical trial specifically investigating the safety and immunogenicity of a baculovirus-expressed hemagglutinin influenza vaccine, which is Flublok. This study is widely cited as evidence that Flublok, which contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, produces greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines. The citation is directly relevant and supports the claim, as it provides clinical evidence linking higher HA content in Flublok to increased immunogenicity."
