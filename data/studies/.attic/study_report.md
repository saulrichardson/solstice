## Claims and Supporting Evidence

### Claim 000: 

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that is circulating is eliminated.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the primary amino acid sequence of the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. It further states that this process eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch with the circulating wild type flu virus, which is what the WHO and FDA select for each season. Therefore, the quote genuinely and explicitly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.*

2. > The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. It explicitly states that recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch caused by changes in the HA structure during egg or cell adaptation, which is a problem in conventional vaccine production. This means the antigen in Flublok remains identical to the selected reference strain, as required by the claim.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > For the 2022-23 season, U.S. cell culture based inactivated (ccIIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from • an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, • an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus, • an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and • an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus.
   
   *The quote directly lists the hemagglutinin (HA) antigens included in the 2022-23 Flublok (RIV4) formulation, specifying the exact strains. The document also states that these strains are selected based on recommendations from the WHO and FDA. Therefore, the quote provides explicit evidence that Flublok (RIV4) contains HA antigens that match the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains for that season, directly supporting the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with those selected strains.*

#### Source: Hsiao_et_al.__2023_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain.
   
   *The quote directly states that Flublok's hemagglutinin protein is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. Since the selected strain refers to the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains for the season, this statement explicitly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with those strains. No inference is required; the document makes this connection clear.*

### Claim 001: 

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains.
   
   *The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 µg of HA per dose per strain. While the quote does not explicitly compare this to the standard 15 µg per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines, it provides the specific HA content for Flublok, which is the key fact in the first part of the claim. The document elsewhere (page 3) mentions that standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (such as Fluarix Quadrivalent) are given at 15 µg per strain, allowing a direct comparison. However, the quote itself does not address immunogenicity or make a direct link to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim (3x HA content), but does not, by itself, support the second part (link to greater immunogenicity).*

#### Source: CDC_Influenza_vaccines

**Text Evidence:**

1. > RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS ≥18 yrs 45 µg/0.5 mL IM
   
   *The quote directly states that Flublok Quadrivalent contains 45 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the 15 µg/0.5 mL dose found in standard-dose flu vaccines, as also shown elsewhere in the document for other products. This directly supports the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim about greater immunogenicity; it only supports the antigen content comparison.*

2. > Fluzone Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS ≥6 mos 15 µg/0.5 mL IM
   
   *The quote provides the HA antigen content (15 µg/0.5 mL) for a standard-dose flu vaccine (Fluzone Quadrivalent). This allows direct comparison to Flublok's known 45 µg/0.5 mL (though Flublok's content is not stated in this document), supporting the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines. The quote does not address immunogenicity, but it does substantiate the first part of the claim regarding antigen content.*

#### Source: FlublokPI

**Text Evidence:**

1. > For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.
   
   *The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA per strain for three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, thus substantiating the '3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content' portion of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the antigen content comparison, but not the immunogenicity aspect.*

2. > Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2), and B/Austria/1359417/2021.
   
   *The quote provides the exact HA (hemagglutinin antigen) content per dose in Flublok: 135 mcg per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg per strain for three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines (though the document does not state the standard-dose content, the quote itself gives the Flublok content as claimed). Therefore, the quote directly supports the part of the claim regarding antigen content. However, the quote does not address immunogenicity or its comparison to standard-dose vaccines; it only supports the antigen content portion of the claim.*

#### Source: Grohskopf_et_al.__2023_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard dose inactivated vaccines).
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 µg of HA antigen per virus, which is 3 times the amount in standard dose inactivated vaccines (15 µg). This substantiates the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. The quote also groups RIV4 with HD-IIV4 as 'higher dose vaccines,' which, in the context of the document, are discussed as being linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Thus, the quote provides direct factual support for the claim.*

2. > Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard dose inactivated vaccines). The adjuvanted vaccine contains 15 µg of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59. HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV (Flublok) contains 45 µg of HA antigen per virus, which is 3 times the 15 µg in standard-dose inactivated vaccines. It also notes that HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, which addresses the claim that the higher HA antigen content has been linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. The information is explicit and does not require inference.*

3. > Quadivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 µg of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 µg total).
   
   *The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by stating that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 µg of HA per strain, which is three times the 15 µg per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines (as confirmed elsewhere in the document, e.g., page 19: 'Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 µg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose'). However, the quote does not itself address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. The document elsewhere (page 14) does discuss that RIV4 is a higher dose vaccine and that higher dose vaccines have shown relative benefit compared with standard-dose vaccines, but the provided quote only substantiates the HA content comparison, not the immunogenicity link. Thus, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim and provides the factual basis for the second part, which is elaborated elsewhere in the document.*

4. > Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 µg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose (7.5 µg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.25-mL dose). For 2022-23, this category is expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1). Four of these are egg based vaccines, and one is acell culture based vaccine. All are approved for persons aged ≥6 months. ... Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 µg of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 µg total).
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim by providing explicit data: standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4) contain 15 µg of HA per strain, while Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 µg per strain, which is 3 times as much. This substantiates the first part of the claim. The document also states elsewhere (page 14) that 'HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard dose inactivated vaccines)' and that 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies,' supporting the link to greater immunogenicity. Thus, the quote and the document as a whole genuinely support the claim.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. Data are needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines against influenza related outcomes in adults under the age ABSTR ACT g Amber Hsiao, Ph. D., M. P. H., Arnold Yee, M. B. A., Bruce Fireman, M. A., John Hansen, M. P. H., Ned Lewis, M. P. H., and Nicola P. Klein, M. D., Ph. D.
   
   *The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines. Additionally, elsewhere in the document, it is stated that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies, which relates to greater immunogenicity. Therefore, the quote and the surrounding context in the document genuinely support the claim.*

2. > The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, and that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. This links the higher HA content to greater immunogenicity, as the claim asserts. No inference is required; the document makes the connection clear.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > a cell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain).
   
   *The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4), which supports the first part of the claim. The document also discusses immunogenicity comparisons between these vaccines, with RIV4 (Flublok) showing higher antibody responses in some cases, supporting the link to greater immunogenicity. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated.*

2. > In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.
   
   *The quote directly supports the second part of the claim by stating that RIV4 (Flublok) induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies (i.e., greater immunogenicity) to cell-based A (H3N2) virus compared to standard-dose vaccines (ccIIV4 and IIV4). The document also explicitly states elsewhere that 'RIV4 contains 3 times the...HA/d...' compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4, supporting the first part of the claim about antigen content. Thus, the quote, in the context of the document, genuinely supports the claim.*

3. > In this randomized trial (Clinical trials gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg based (IIV4), cell culture based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines were compared. RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain).
   
   *The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4). The second part of the claim, regarding greater immunogenicity, is also supported elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4'), but the quote itself is focused on the antigen content. Thus, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The vaccine (Flublok) used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses.
   
   *The quote explicitly states that Flublok contains 45 mcg of each HA component per strain in the trivalent vaccine. This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Based solely on what is stated in the document, the quote supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines.*

2. > The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses. This is three times the amount of hemagglutinin present in standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines, which contain 15 mcg of HA per strain.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, compared to 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose vaccines. While the quote does not itself mention immunogenicity, it provides the specific factual basis for the first part of the claim regarding antigen content, which is the main focus of the claim. The linkage to immunogenicity is not contradicted and is supported elsewhere in the document, but the quote itself is sufficient to substantiate the antigen content comparison.*

### Claim 002: 

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that traditional split or subunit vaccines (which are cell- and egg-based) have the potential to acquire adaptive mutations during growth in embryonated chicken eggs or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. It further states that such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine. This is a direct and explicit confirmation of the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.*

2. > Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example of a mutation (glutamine to arginine at position 226) arising during egg-based vaccine production, and explains that this mutation altered the immune response such that antibodies preferentially bound to the vaccine-derived HA rather than the circulating wild type virus. This demonstrates that mutations can occur during production and may reduce vaccine effectiveness, as the claim asserts.*

3. > During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example where mutations (H156Q, G186V, S219Y) developed during egg-based vaccine production, and explicitly states that these mutations were attributed to a reduction in vaccine effectiveness (41%) for H3N2 in the 2012-2013 season. This demonstrates that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness, as the claim asserts.*

4. > Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation during vaccine manufacturing have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness in multiple influenza seasons. This demonstrates that mutations can develop during production (specifically in egg-based vaccines) and that these mutations may reduce vaccine effectiveness, which is exactly what the claim asserts.*

5. > Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for H3 N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to circulating strains 27. Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim by stating that lower vaccine effectiveness for H3N2 has been observed even when the vaccine strain is well matched to circulating strains, and that differences in HA glycosylation (which can arise during production) are thought to contribute to this reduced effectiveness. This aligns with the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations or changes during production that may reduce their effectiveness.*

6. > The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.
   
   *The quote explicitly states that recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch that can occur due to changes in the primary HA structure during egg- or cell-based adaptation. This directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote confirms that such changes (mutations) are a known risk in egg- or cell-based production, and that recombinant technology avoids this risk.*

7. > During the 2014-2015 influenza season, a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26. For the 2016-2017 season, the influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26. However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a concrete example where an egg-adapted vaccine virus lost a glycosylation site during production, and as a result, antibodies induced by the vaccine poorly neutralized the circulating strain that retained the glycosylation site. This demonstrates that mutations (in this case, loss of a glycosylation site) can occur during production in eggs, and these mutations can reduce vaccine effectiveness. The quote is explicit and does not require inference beyond what is stated.*

8. > The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.
   
   *The quote directly addresses the potential for cell- and egg-based flu vaccines to develop mutations during production, stating that while the chances are low due to stringent quality control, the risk is not zero. It explicitly mentions the possibility of introducing deleterious mutations through adaptation of the seed virus during manufacturing, which may reduce vaccine effectiveness. This directly supports the claim that such vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.
   
   *The quote directly states that the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which implies that standard dose egg-based vaccines are susceptible to such drift. Antigenic drift during manufacturing refers to the development of mutations that can reduce vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, the quote explicitly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.*

2. > The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the effectiveness of standard dose (egg-based) vaccines may be reduced ('attenuated') by antigenic drift (mutations) that occur during egg-based manufacturing. It also contrasts this with recombinant vaccines, which are not susceptible to such drift. This directly affirms that mutations during production can reduce the effectiveness of egg-based (and by extension, cell-based if similar processes apply) flu vaccines, as the claim asserts.*

#### Source: Liu_et_al.__2024_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The manufacturing process can lead to egg adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the manufacturing process (specifically for egg-based vaccines) can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein, which could alter antigenicity and reduce vaccine effectiveness. This matches the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.*

2. > Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted (mutated) epitopes, which are not present on circulating viruses, and that this can reduce immunogenicity (immune response) to the actual circulating viruses. This means that mutations arising during egg-based vaccine production can lead to a less effective immune response against the real-world virus, thus potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness, which is exactly what the claim asserts.*

3. > Several studies have reported that Q223R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It states that the Q223R mutation, which arises as an egg-adapted change in the HA head domain of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity, and influence immune response. This demonstrates that mutations can develop during egg-based vaccine production and that these mutations can alter the antigenic properties of the virus and affect the immune response, which may reduce vaccine effectiveness. Thus, the quote provides a specific example that substantiates the claim.*

4. > Egg adaptation can introduce mutations in the HA protein that are not present in circulating viruses, potentially leading to a mismatch between vaccine-induced immunity and the actual viruses causing infection. Several studies have reported that Q223R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response.
   
   *The quote, as found in the document, directly supports the claim. It states that egg adaptation can introduce mutations in the HA protein (such as Q223R) that are not present in circulating viruses, and that these mutations can alter antigenicity and influence immune response. This provides a mechanistic explanation for how mutations arising during vaccine production (specifically in eggs) can reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine, thus supporting the claim.*

5. > Multiple seasons of non-egg based vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immune memory to egg adapted epitopes and re-focus the immune response towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It states that immune memory can be focused on egg-adapted epitopes (which arise due to mutations during egg-based vaccine production), and that this can reduce vaccine effectiveness against circulating viruses. The need to redirect immune responses away from these egg-adapted epitopes by using non-egg-based vaccines implies that mutations acquired during production in eggs can reduce effectiveness, thus substantiating the claim.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **figure_p8_mrg_det_7_005.png**: The significant reductions in HI titers against cell‐propagated viruses in individuals vaccinated with egg‐propagated vaccines demonstrate that production method can alter antigenicity and reduce immune recognition, which supports the claim

- **figure_p9_det_8_005.png**: The figure supports the claim by demonstrating that egg-based vaccine recipients had diminished serologic responses to cell-propagated virus strains, consistent with egg-adapted mutations during production that may reduce vaccine effectiveness.

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Although embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production for growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the process of growing influenza vaccines in eggs 'can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains.' This means that mutations or changes can occur during production, potentially making the vaccine less effective against the actual circulating strains. This is exactly what the claim asserts about the potential for mutations during production reducing effectiveness.*

   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the process of growing influenza vaccines in eggs 'can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains.' This means that mutations or variants can arise during egg-based production, potentially making the vaccine less effective against the actual circulating strains. This is exactly what the claim asserts: that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.*

1. > because it is not subject to mutations to the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site that reduce the effectiveness of egg based vaccines.
   
   *The quote directly states that egg-based vaccines are subject to mutations at the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site, and that these mutations reduce their effectiveness. This explicitly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote specifically addresses egg-based vaccines, confirming the claim for that production method.*

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > clearly demonstrate structural differences between HA pre fusion and post fusion states, and the presence of unique neutralising epitopes in the pre fusion HA0 molecules, which are present in RIV4 (Fig. 2). Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64. Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant technology (RIV4) leads to structural differences that result in both qualitative and quantitative differences in immune response, including significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies and more robust T-cell and antibody responses compared to conventional vaccines. The mention of broadly cross-reactive antibodies and robust immune responses substantiates the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.*

2. > antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials . RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, SanofiPasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of aglycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports 26.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It describes a clinical study showing that RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) induces broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted (mismatched) A/H3N2 viruses in humans. The data show that RIV4 recipients had a higher geometric mean fold rise against circulating viruses and a statistically significant association with seroconversion to an antigenically drifted strain, even when overall titers were low. This demonstrates that recombinant technology can lead to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection in mismatch seasons, as claimed.*

3. > conserved regions of the molecule for the induction of immunity with broader protection 12 71 76 80. In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutralising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) induces antibodies to conserved regions, including both the HA stem and head, and at greater proportions than traditional vaccines. It also notes higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response and references the need to verify if this broader antibody repertoire underlies the cross-protection against antigenic drift (i.e., mismatched) variants observed in clinical trials. Thus, the quote provides direct evidence that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.*

4. > The evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional egg or mammalian cell derived vaccines, particularly in terms of speed, scalability, and flexibility of manufacturing, and to improve the breadth and longevity of the protective immune response across age groups, giving rise to an array of next generation vaccines. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this.
   
   *The quote explicitly states that BEVS/recombinant technology (used in RIV4) improves the breadth and longevity of the protective immune response, and that features of the recombinant HA structure are likely responsible for generating broad cross-reactive and protective antibodies. It also notes that recombinant technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to changes in HA structure from egg or cell adaptation. These points directly support the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.*

5. > The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross protection against mismatched influenza strains 12 75. The study by Nachbagauer et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent influenza viruses similar to the multiple A/H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82. Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against influenza.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant technology (specifically, rHA produced in insect cells) leads to a broader immune response, referencing the higher accessibility of conserved stem regions and the resulting cross-protection against mismatched influenza strains. It also cites studies showing increased titres of broadly neutralising antibodies and links these immune responses to protection against drifted (mismatched) viruses. Thus, the quote provides direct and specific evidence for the claim that recombinant technology may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.*

6. > This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the benefits of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.
   
   *The quote directly links the unique features of recombinant technology (BEVS derived rHA) to maximizing vaccine performance and specifically highlights the preservation of conserved epitopes as critical for imparting cross-protection against evolving viruses. This supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, by explicitly stating the mechanism (preservation of conserved epitopes) and the outcome (cross-protection against evolving and mutating viruses).*

7. > The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions could provide broader specificity. Antisera raised against simple monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine induced protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76-79.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. It explicitly states that simpler glycosylation (a feature of recombinant HA) leads to broader and more cross-protective antibody responses, including cross-clade protection. The mechanistic evidence provided (improved breadth and capacity of neutralising antibodies, superior cross-clade protection) is directly relevant to the claim about broader immune response and cross-protection, without requiring inference beyond what is stated.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It provides explicit evidence that Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine) demonstrated efficacy (44.8%) against influenza strains even when 96% of circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine. This shows that the vaccine provided cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim about recombinant technology leading to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection.*

**Visual Evidence:**

**Text Evidence:**

1. > After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg based vaccines generally reinforced the neutralizing antibody responses to egg adapted epitopes as evidenced by an increased trend in the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio ≥4. In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of participants with egg cell ratio ≥4 did not increase, suggesting a broader response not focused on egg-adapted epitopes.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It states that recombinant (RIV4) and cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccines do not increase the proportion of participants with a high GMT egg cell titer ratio, unlike egg-based vaccines, which do. This is interpreted as evidence that RIV4 and ccIIV4 elicit a broader immune response not focused on egg-adapted epitopes. This broader response is relevant to the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.*

2. > In contrast, among recipients of non egg based vaccines in just one study year (IIV4-ccIIV4 or IIV4-RIV4) or in both study years (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4), the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio ≥4 did not increase, suggesting a broader response not focused on egg-adapted epitopes.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It states that recipients of non-egg-based vaccines (including recombinant vaccines) did not show an increased proportion of participants with a strong bias toward egg-adapted epitopes, which is interpreted as a broader immune response. The phrase 'suggesting a broader response not focused on egg-adapted epitopes' explicitly supports the idea that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response, which may provide cross-protection even in a mismatch season. The quote is specific and does not require inference beyond what is stated.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **table_p1_det_0_013.png**: The narrative text explicitly attributes broader immune responses and potential cross-protection to recombinant technology, which supports the claim.

- **figure_p5_det_4_000.png**: The data show that the recombinant vaccine induces broader and stronger antibody responses to both egg- and cell-propagated antigens, particularly cell-propagated H3N2, which supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection in a mismatch season.

- **figure_p7_mrg_det_6_003.png**: supports the claim because recombinant RIV4 induces antibody responses with lower divergence between egg‐ and cell‐grown antigens and demonstrates greater preservation of neutralization against cell‐grown (circulating) strains, implying a broader, cross‐protective immune response even when vaccine and circulating strains mismatch.

- **figure_p8_mrg_det_7_005.png**: The figure demonstrates that RIV4 elicits higher and broader HI responses against cell-grown (mismatched) viruses compared with egg-based and cell-based IIV4, which supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection in a mismatch season.

- **figure_p9_det_8_005.png**: The lower rate of HI titer reduction in recombinant vaccine recipients indicates broader cross-reactivity against mismatched, cell-grown viruses and thus supports the claim

- **figure_p10_mrg_det_9_004.png**: The elevated stalk‐specific antibody responses in RIV4‐containing groups indicate a broader immune response targeting conserved HA regions, which supports the claim

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US during the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A viruses detected in this study were H3 N2 viruses that represented substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It states that during a season with a substantial antigenic mismatch between circulating H3N2 viruses and the vaccine, Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) still provided significant protective efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza illness, including CDC-ILI cases. This demonstrates that the recombinant vaccine led to a broader immune response that provided cross-protection even in a mismatch season, as asserted in the claim.*

2. > Only 8 isolates in the study (<5% of the total) were antigenically identical to the strains contained in the vaccine. All of these viruses were A/Wisconsin/67/2005 like H3N2 viruses. Two of these occurred in Flublok recipients and 6 occurred in placebo recipients, and among these subjects one Flublok recipient and 5 placebo recipients met the CDC-ILI definition. Therefore, we were unable to obtain a meaningful estimate of the efficacy of Flublok against CDC-ILI due to strains represented in the vaccine. The remaining 111 influenza A viruses were characterized as antigenic variants, i.e., they exhibited a 4 fold or greater decrease in reactivity with post infection ferret antisera in reciprocal HAI testing. These viruses included 12 H1N1 viruses antigenically resembling H1 drift variant A/Brisbane/59/2007, 41 H3N2 viruses antigenically resembling the H3 drift variant A/Brisbane/10/2007, 2 H3N2 viruses that could not be identified as either A/Wisconsin-like or A/Brisbane-like, and 16 influenza viruses for which the subtype was not determined. Fifty eight of the 59 influenza B viruses (98%) were antigenically similar to B/Florida/04/2006, presenting a different clade from the vaccine strain, and one influenza B virus could not be antigenically characterized. The cumulative rates of culture confirmed influenza illness ...
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim that recombinant technology (Flublok) leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. The passage details that the vast majority of circulating viruses were antigenic variants (i.e., mismatched to the vaccine), and that there were too few matched cases to estimate efficacy against matched strains. The context of the study, as described elsewhere in the document, is that Flublok still demonstrated protective efficacy in this setting, implying cross-protection. The quote provides the factual basis for the claim by showing the predominance of mismatched strains and the continued measurement of efficacy, thus substantiating the claim without requiring inference beyond what is stated.*

   *The quote directly states that RIV4 (a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine) induces higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines, which include standard-dose egg-based vaccines. This directly supports the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.*

4. > In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It reports that in a study, the antibody response (measured by geometric mean fold rise) against two circulating A/H3N2 viruses was twice as high for the higher-dose recombinant vaccine (RIV4) compared to both high-dose and adjuvanted egg-based vaccines (HD-IIV3 and aIIV3). This provides explicit comparative data showing a more robust antibody response from the recombinant vaccine, as claimed.*

5. > In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutralising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77.

   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that a randomized clinical trial found that the higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV4) induced significantly higher postvaccination HAI antibody responses compared to a licensed, egg-based, standard-dose IIV4 among adults aged ≥50 years.

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It states that the recombinant vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines and that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. This explicitly links the higher dose in the recombinant vaccine to a more robust antibody response, which is the essence of the claim. No inference is required; the document makes the connection clear.*

2. > The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3 N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3 N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It states that the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine over the standard-dose vaccine is likely due to its higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, and specifically attributes this to its higher dose of hemagglutinin. This links the higher-dose recombinant vaccine to a more robust antibody response compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines, as the claim asserts.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.
   
   *The quote directly compares the antibody response induced by the higher-dose recombinant vaccine (RIV4) to that of standard-dose egg-based vaccines (IIV4), showing that RIV4 produced higher neutralizing and binding antibodies against the A (H3 N2) virus. This directly supports the claim that vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.*

2. > RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody response in both age groups, it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4 A, Fig. S1 A).
   
   *The quote explicitly states that RIV4 (the recombinant vaccine) contains three times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per dose per strain compared to the standard-dose egg-based (IIV4) and cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccines. It further states that, for A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination significantly increased the quantity of total cell HA head binding antibodies, indicating a more robust antibody response. This directly supports the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV4) may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.*

- **figure_p8_mrg_det_7_005.png**: The figure shows vaccine arms that include recombinant RIV4 producing higher antibody titers than egg-based IIV4 at 1 month, with multiple p-values <0.05, which supports the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine induces a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.

   *The quote explicitly states that the comparator in Study 6 was 'U.S.licensed quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.' This directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine). The quote also references Study 6, which is described elsewhere in the document as the pivotal efficacy study. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with non adjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory confirmed influenza illness are few in number and were conducted over few influenza seasons. HD-IIV3 was more effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or culture confirmed influenza like illness (ILI) in a two season randomized study conducted among 32,000 persons aged ≥65 years (relative efficacy: 24%; 95% CI: 10–36; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single season randomized trials of RIV versus non adjuvanted SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus non adjuvanted SD-IIV3 that assessed culture confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus non adjuvanted SD-IIV4 that examined PCR-confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged ≥65 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: −17% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate). The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over non adjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged ≥50 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10–47 as well as in a qualified ILI endpoint among those aged ≥65 years (relative efficacy: 42%; 95% CI: 9%–65%) (68).
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that a randomized trial compared RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) to a nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine). This matches the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), as Fluarix is a standard-dose quadrivalent IIV. The quote provides specific details about the study design, population, and results, confirming the claim without requiring inference.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > In this study performed during two influenza seasons, participants between the ages of 50 and 64 years who received the recombinant vaccine had more protection against confirmed influenza than those who received a standard dose vaccine.
   
   *The quote directly states that the study compared a recombinant vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) to a standard dose vaccine in participants aged 50 to 64, and found greater protection in the recombinant group. The methods and results sections of the document confirm that the recombinant vaccine used was Flublok Quadrivalent and that the comparator was a standard dose quadrivalent vaccine (Fluarix or similar). Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneficiaries study [10] using retrospective data as described above, reported significant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4) against influenza related hospital encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults 50 years old, but not for adults 65 years old [11].
   
   *The quote explicitly states that a randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok) with standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4, which includes Fluarix). The document further clarifies in the tables and footnotes that SD-IIV4 includes Fluarix. Therefore, the quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).*

2. > SD-IIV4 included Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, Standard Dose Fluzone and FlucelVax. HD-IIV4 was High Dose Fluzone, RIV4 was Flublok and Adj-IV was FluAd.
   
   *The quote explicitly lists the vaccine types used in the study, showing that SD-IIV4 included Fluarix (a quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) and that RIV4 was Flublok. This directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), as both vaccines were included in the comparative analysis.*

3. > c RIV4: Flublok. c SD-IIV4: Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, Standard Dose Flu zone and FlucelVax.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly lists Flublok as RIV4 and Fluarix as one of the SD-IIV4 vaccines. Since the study compares RIV4 (Flublok) to SD-IIV4 (which includes Fluarix), this confirms that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) in the pivotal trial described in the document.*

### Claim 006: 

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) is produced using a novel production platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). It also provides additional technical details about the process, such as the use of expresSF+ insect cells and the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, which further substantiates the claim. No inference is required; the support is explicit and direct.*

2. > Fig. 2 Structural features of native HA expressed on influenza virus and rHA produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system. a HA protein (shown as monomer) extracted from influenza virus is a heterodimer comprising HA1 (turquoise) and HA2 (orange) linked though an inter disulfide (S-S) bond and contains complex type sialylated N-linked glycans. Cleaved fusion peptides (green) and complex glycans eliminate and mask unique epitopes on HA respectively. b Recombinant HA protein (shown as monomer) expressed in insect cells.
   
   *The quote explicitly describes recombinant HA (rHA) being produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), which is the core of the claim about Flublok's production platform. It directly supports the claim by stating the use of BEVS and insect cells for expressing recombinant HA, matching the technical details required.*

   *The quote directly references the generation of recombinant HA (rHA) using a baculovirus insect cell expression system, as illustrated in Figure 1 and cited from Cox & Hashimoto (2011). This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The quote is specific to the method of production and does not require inference, thus it genuinely supports the claim.*

   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly mentions that the manufacture of RIV4 (Flublok) involves a purification system for a product produced in insect cells using baculovirus (BV), which is consistent with the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). No inference is required; the quote provides direct factual support.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+®) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells (derived from Sf9 cells of Spodoptera frugiperda) using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), specifically naming the baculovirus (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus). This matches all elements of the claim without requiring inference.*

2. > Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single dose, pre filled syringes contain no natural rubber latex. Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins (≤14.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA (≤10 ng), and Triton X-100 (≤100 mcg).
   
   *The quote directly mentions that each dose of Flublok may contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins, which are insect cell proteins. This supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The presence of these residuals is explicit evidence of the use of both baculovirus and insect cells in the production process, as described in the claim.*

   *The quote directly describes the referenced vaccine as a 'baculovirus expressed hemagglutinin influenza vaccine.' This explicitly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) to express recombinant HA. The reference is used in the context of supporting information about Flublok, and the technical description matches the claim's content.*

This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, confirming the use of a novel production platform involving insect cells. It also notes that the vaccine is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs, which is consistent with the use of a recombinant, non-egg-based system. While the quote does not mention 'baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)' by name, it does state that recombinant HA is produced in insect cells, which is the key novel aspect of the production platform. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated.*

One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, which is the core of the claim. It also mentions the use of genetic sequences and the absence of influenza viruses or eggs in the manufacturing process, which aligns with the description of a novel production platform using recombinant technology in insect cells. While the quote does not use the term 'baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)' specifically, it does state the essential facts about recombinant HA production in insect cells, which is the key point of the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated.*

The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.
   
   *The quote explicitly states that the recombinant HA proteins (rHA) used in the study were 'expressed from the baculovirus system,' which is the core of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) referenced in the claim. While the quote does not mention Flublok by name, the context of the document and the use of recombinant HA proteins produced in this way directly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS. No inference beyond the explicit statement about the baculovirus system is required.*

This supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS. While the quote does not explicitly mention 'insect cells,' the use of the baculovirus system for recombinant HA production is a defining feature of BEVS, and the context of the document (discussing Flublok and RIV4) makes it clear that this is the method being referenced. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0.
   
   *The quote directly states that Flublok is produced by expressing recombinant HA in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. This explicitly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). No inference is required; the quote provides all necessary details.*

2. > Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDC derived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year.
   
   *The quote directly describes a key step in the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS): cloning genes into baculovirus. This is central to the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS. The quote provides explicit evidence that the production process involves inserting genes into baculovirus, which is then used in the BEVS platform, thus supporting the claim.*

3. > Among the available expression technologies, recombinant baculovirus is especially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because the rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this vector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expression of the HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus also avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live influenza viruses, and the attendant biocontainment issues that would be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines [7]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for seasonal influenza.
   
   *The quote explicitly states that recombinant baculovirus is used to express HA protein in insect cells, which matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The quote also discusses the advantages of this method and confirms its use in the context of influenza vaccine production, directly supporting the claim.*

4. > The current study provides evidence of protective efficacy of baculovirus derived HA vaccine in adults for prevention of seasonal influenza and supports that significant protection in a primed population can be obtained against influenza with a pure hemagglutinin vaccine.
   
   *The quote directly refers to the vaccine as a 'baculovirus derived HA vaccine,' which links it to the baculovirus expression system mentioned in the claim. Earlier in the document, it is explicitly stated that Flublok is 'produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system.' Therefore, the quote, in the context of the document, supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).*

5. > Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has been developed as an alternative to egg-based vaccine production.
   
   *The quote directly states that recombinant baculovirus is used to express proteins in insect cells, which is the novel production platform referenced in the claim. This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The quote does not mention Flublok by name, but the surrounding context in the document makes clear that this is the method used for Flublok production. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.*

6. > HA0 vaccine produced using the baculovirus expression system in healthy adults [9]. These vaccines have been well tolerated at all doses administered, and are associated with low rates of local reactions.
   
   *The quote explicitly states that the HA0 vaccine (which, from context throughout the document, refers to Flublok) is produced using the baculovirus expression system. This directly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The quote does not mention 'insect cells' in this sentence, but earlier in the document (page 2) it is clearly stated that 'The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9].' Therefore, the quote, in the context of the document, genuinely supports the claim.*

### Claim 007: 

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem in both mice and humans compared to egg derived split vaccines 64.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS (as in RIV4) induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA (head and stem) compared to egg-derived split vaccines, in both mice and humans. This matches the claim in both content and specificity, with no need for inference.*

2. > In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutralising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (a recombinant HA antigen produced using BEVS) induces higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA (both stem and head) compared to egg-derived and mammalian cell-derived vaccines. It specifically mentions higher titres of stem-specific neutralising antibodies and greater proportions of antibodies to HA head epitopes, as well as higher haemagglutination inhibitory antibody responses. These points directly substantiate the claim that BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against conserved HA regions compared with egg-derived vaccines.*

3. > The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross protection against mismatched influenza strains 12 75. The study by Nachbagauer et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age78.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It states that recombinant HA antigens produced in insect cells (using BEVS) have a higher quantity and greater accessibility of the conserved stem region, which may contribute to cross-protection against mismatched strains. It also cites a study (Nachbagauer et al.) showing that recombinant vaccines result in increased titres of broadly neutralising HA stem-reactive antibodies, and that these responses increase with age. While the quote does not explicitly compare to egg-derived vaccines in a head-to-head study, it does attribute the superior cross-reactive antibody induction to the unique features of BEVS-produced rHA, supporting the claim as stated.*

4. > RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It provides explicit comparative evidence that RIV4 (a BEVS-produced recombinant HA vaccine) induces significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies than egg-derived vaccines (HD-IIV3 and aIIV3), specifically against antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses. The data cited (geometric mean fold rise being twice as high for RIV4) and the context (broadly cross-reactive antibody responses) match the claim's requirements. The quote is specific, quantitative, and directly relevant.*

### Claim 008: 

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains.
   
   *The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 µg (micrograms) of HA per dose from each of the four strains, which matches the claim that Flublok contains 45 micrograms of HA per strain. While the quote does not mention the 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose influenza vaccine, it does provide the specific number for Flublok, which is the main point of the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim regarding the HA content per strain in Flublok.*

2. > A plant derived recombinant quadrivalent VLP (QVLP) at 30 µg dose per strain was found to be non inferior in terms of vaccine efficacy against respiratory illness and influenza like illness to a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quadrivalent, GlaxoSmithKline) given at 15 µg dose strain in adults aged 18 to 64 years 37.
   
   *The quote directly states that the standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quadrivalent) is given at 15 µg (micrograms) per strain. This supports the part of the claim regarding the HA content per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine. While the quote does not mention Flublok or its 45 µg per strain content, it does provide the necessary comparator value (15 µg per strain) for standard-dose vaccines, which is required to substantiate the claim's comparison. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as it relates to the standard-dose vaccine HA content.*

#### Source: CDC_Influenza_vaccines

**Text Evidence:**

1. > RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) 45 µg/0.5 mL
   
   *The quote directly states that the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok) contains 45 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, as compared to the standard-dose influenza vaccine, which is also listed in the document as containing 15 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.*

2. > Flu zone Quad rival ent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS ≥6 mos 15 µg/0.5 mL IM
   
   *The quote directly states that the standard-dose influenza vaccine (Fluzone Quadrivalent) contains 15 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose per strain. This supports the claim by providing the specific HA content for the standard-dose vaccine, which is necessary for the comparison to Flublok's 45 mcg per strain. While the quote does not mention Flublok, it provides the standard-dose value required for the claim.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **figure_p2_det_1_000.png**: supports the claim because the table provides data showing Flublok contains 45 µg HA per strain while standard-dose IIV4 vaccines contain 15 µg HA per strain.

**Text Evidence:**

1. > For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.
   
   *The quote directly states that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain for each of the three influenza virus strains in the 2024-2025 formulation. This explicitly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, which is in contrast to the 15 mcg per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine (though the standard-dose comparison is not in the quote, the Flublok content is directly supported).*

2. > Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+®) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes. Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain for each of the three influenza virus strains. While the quote does not mention the standard-dose influenza vaccine's HA content (15 mcg per strain), it does provide the specific value for Flublok, which is the key part of the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim regarding Flublok's HA content per strain.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 µg of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 µg total).
   
   *The quote directly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 45 micrograms (µg) of HA per strain. The document also provides, in Table 1 and elsewhere, that standard-dose influenza vaccines contain 15 µg of HA per strain. Therefore, the quote explicitly and directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain versus 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.*

2. > Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 µg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose (7.5 µg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.25-mL dose). For 2022-23, this category is expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1).
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim by stating that standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 influenza vaccines contain 15 micrograms (µg) of HA per strain in a 0.5-mL dose. This is the comparator for Flublok, which is known (from other parts of the document) to contain 45 µg of HA per strain. The quote provides the specific number for standard-dose vaccines, which is the key fact needed to substantiate the claim's comparison.*

3. > Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard dose in activated vaccines).
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 µg of HA per virus (strain), while standard dose inactivated vaccines contain 15 µg per strain, matching the claim's numbers and comparison. No inference is required; the support is explicit.*

4. > [TABLE 2 - See table_p5_det_4_002.png] Flublok Quad rival ent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5 mL PFS ≥18 yrs 45 µg/0.5 mL IM ... Afluria Quad rival ent (Seqirus) 0.5-mL PFS ≥3 ... 15 µg/0.5 mL IM ...
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim by providing a side-by-side comparison of the HA content per strain in Flublok Quadrivalent (45 mcg/0.5 mL) and a standard-dose influenza vaccine (Afluria Quadrivalent, 15 mcg/0.5 mL). This matches the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose vaccines. No inference is required; the data is explicit.*

5. > Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with non adjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard dose inactivated vaccines). The adjuvanted vaccine contains 15 µg of HA per virus, similarly to non adjuvanted SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59.
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain, while standard-dose inactivated vaccines contain 15 mcg of HA per strain. This matches the claim's assertion and provides the specific numbers for both Flublok and standard-dose influenza vaccines.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **table_p5_det_4_002.png**: The table directly shows Flublok contains 45 µg HA per dose versus 15 µg per dose in standard-dose influenza vaccines, which supports the claim.

**Text Evidence:**

1. > BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.
   
   *The quote directly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines. Since the standard dose is known to be 15 mcg of HA per strain, this supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain (3 x 15 mcg = 45 mcg). The quote provides explicit comparative information about the HA content, which substantiates the claim.*

2. > The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.
   
   *The quote explicitly states that Flublok contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines. While it does not provide the exact numbers (45 mcg vs 15 mcg), it directly supports the claim's core assertion about the relative HA content per strain. Since the standard dose is known to be 15 mcg, 'three times' confirms Flublok contains 45 mcg per strain, thus supporting the claim.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > acell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d
   
   *The quote directly supports the claim by stating that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 3 times the amount of HA per dose compared to standard-dose vaccines, and references the 45 HA/d (interpreted as 45 micrograms HA per dose per strain). This matches the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg in standard-dose vaccines. The document does not provide the full sentence, but the key facts and numbers are present and unambiguous.*

2. > IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody
   
   *The quote directly states that IIV4 and ccIIV4 (standard-dose influenza vaccines) contain 15 µg HA per dose per strain. This supports the claim's comparison between Flublok (RIV4) and standard-dose vaccines, as the claim asserts that Flublok contains 45 µg HA per strain versus 15 µg in standard-dose vaccines. While the quote does not mention the 45 µg content of Flublok, it provides explicit evidence for the 15 µg content in standard-dose vaccines, which is a key part of the claim.*

3. > In this randomized trial (Clinical trials gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post vaccination with quad rival ent in activated egg based (IIV4), cell culture based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) influenza acell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d
   
   *The quote explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 3 times the HA (hemagglutinin antigen) content, and the number '45 HA/d' (interpreted as 45 micrograms of HA per dose/strain) is present. Since standard-dose influenza vaccines (IIV4, ccIIV4) are known to contain 15 mcg HA per strain, this statement directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg in standard-dose vaccines. The document does not contradict this, and the numbers and context are preserved.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses.
   
   *The quote directly states that the trivalent Flublok vaccine contained 45 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain. This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain. However, the quote does not mention the HA content of standard-dose influenza vaccines (15 mcg per strain), so it only supports the part of the claim about Flublok's content, not the comparison. Still, it provides explicit evidence for the Flublok portion of the claim.*

2. > comb in ant, baculovirus expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (Flublok®). Methods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injection of saline placebo (2304 subjects), or trivalent Flublok containing 45 mcg of each rHA0 component (2344 subjects).
   
   *The quote directly states that trivalent Flublok contains 45 mcg of each rHA0 component (i.e., per strain). This explicitly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain. While the quote does not mention the 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose influenza vaccine, it does provide the specific information about Flublok required by the claim.*

3. > The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses.
   
   *The quote directly states that the trivalent Flublok vaccine contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain, as measured by a specific assay, and lists the three strains included. This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, which is higher than the 15 mcg per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine (the latter is not mentioned in the quote, but the Flublok content is explicitly confirmed).*

4. > Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injection of saline placebo (2304 subjects), or trivalent Flublok containing 45 mcg of each rHA0 component (2344 subjects).
   
   *The quote explicitly states that the trivalent Flublok vaccine contains 45 mcg of each rHA0 component (i.e., per strain). This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain. While the quote does not mention the 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose influenza vaccine, it fully substantiates the portion of the claim regarding Flublok's HA content per strain.*
