          "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that is circulating is eliminated.",

It explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the primary amino acid sequence of the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. It further states that this process eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch with the circulating wild type flu virus, which is what the WHO and FDA select for each season.

Therefore, we were unable to obtain a meaningful estimate of the efficacy of Flublok against CDC-ILI due to strains represented in the vaccine. The remaining 111 influenza A viruses were characterized as antigenic variants, i.e., they exhibited a 4 fold or greater decrease in reactivity with post infection ferret antisera in reciprocal HAI testing.

This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, which is higher than the 15 mcg per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine (the latter is not mentioned in the quote, but the Flublok content is explicitly confirmed).",
