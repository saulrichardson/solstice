## Claims and Supporting Evidence

### Claim 000: 

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that is circulating in the population is eliminated.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording (e.g., 'baculovirus' vs 'baculo virus', 'rHA' vs 'rHA', 'RIV4' vs 'RIV4'). The factual content and technical details are preserved. The passage states: 'Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculo virus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that is circulating in the population is eliminated.' This matches the quote to verify in all substantive respects.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production, and that the risk of antigenic mismatch is eliminated. This means the antigenic match with the WHO- and FDA-selected strains is preserved, as those are the strains selected for vaccine production. The quote does not require inference and is directly relevant to the claim.*

2. > The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.
   
   *A semantically equivalent quote appears in the document: 'The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.' This matches the provided quote in all factual content, though the original includes a comma and some minor wording differences (e.g., 'the risk of antigenic mismatch' vs. 'risk of antigenic mismatch'). The meaning and technical content are preserved.. The quote directly states that recombinant protein technology (as used in Flublok) eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch caused by changes in the HA structure during egg or cell adaptation. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it asserts that the process avoids the mismatches that can occur in traditional vaccine production. The statement is explicit and does not require inference.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies. Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.
   
   *The quote appears in the document in the following section: 'Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies. Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor formatting and spacing differences, and all technical content and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins from the three influenza virus strains specified by health authorities for the annual vaccine, and that it is standardized according to USPHS requirements. It also lists the exact strains included for the 2024-2025 season, matching those selected by WHO and FDA. This directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it is formulated to contain the antigens from those specific strains.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **table_p4_mrg_det_3_015.png**: A table listing influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigens used in Flublok alongside the WHO- and FDA-recommended vaccine strains for a given influenza season, showing matching strain names for each HA component (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B). Evidence: Flublok’s recombinant HA antigens are labeled with the exact same WHO- and FDA-selected strain designations (e.g., A/California/07/2009, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, B/Brisbane/60/2008) indicating an identical antigenic match. supports the claim because the table directly demonstrates that Flublok includes HA proteins matching the WHO- and FDA-recommended strains by identical strain name and subtype.

**Text Evidence:**

1. > For the 2022-23 season, U.S. cell culture based inactivated (ccIIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from • an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus, • an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus, • an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and • an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus.
   
   *The quote appears on page 19 of the document: 'For the 2022-23 season, U.S. cell culture based inactivated (ccIIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from • an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus, • an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus, • an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and • an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus.' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., bullet points and line breaks).. The quote explicitly states that recombinant (RIV4, i.e., Flublok) influenza vaccines for the 2022-23 season will contain hemagglutinin (HA) antigens derived from the exact strains listed, which are the strains selected by the WHO and FDA for that season. This directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it confirms the vaccine's composition is based on those specific recommendations.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain.' This matches the provided quote in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly states that the hemagglutinin protein in Flublok is 'genetically identical to that in the selected strain.' Since the selected strain refers to the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains for the season, this supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with those strains. The quote is explicit and does not require inference.*

#### Source: Liu_et_al.__2024_

**Visual Evidence:**

- **figure_p6_det_5_006.png**: Multi-panel ELISA data showing total HA head and stalk antibody responses to egg-propagated and cell-propagated influenza virus HA at pre-vaccination, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIIV4, Fluarix IIIV4, cell-based IV4, and RIV4). Panel B presents geometric mean ratios of egg HA vs cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month for H3, H1, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata HAs. Evidence: In Panel B, RIV4 (Flublok) shows egg/cell HA ELISA titer ratios close to 1 for both H3 and H1 HA, indicating equivalent binding to egg- and cell-derived antigens. The near-unity egg/cell HA titer ratios for RIV4 demonstrate no antigenic difference between vaccine HA and WHO/FDA-selected HA antigens, which supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match. Note: Data are limited to the strains tested and timepoints shown; the figure does not explicitly reference WHO or FDA selection criteria.

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDC derived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor formatting and OCR differences: 'Genes were cloned into baculo virus using RT-PCR from the same Cd ce rived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed nactivated influenza vaccine for that year.' This matches the quoted content in meaning and technical detail.. The quote explicitly states that the genes used for Flublok were cloned from the same CDC-derived vaccine seed viruses as those used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccines for that year. Since the CDC-derived seed viruses are selected based on WHO and FDA recommendations, this directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. The quote provides specific, factual evidence that the antigenic components in Flublok are sourced from the same material as standard, licensed vaccines, substantiating the claim without requiring inference.*

### Claim 001: 

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains.' The factual content, including the product names, the recombinant nature, and the 45 µg HA per strain, is preserved and matches the quote to verify.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 µg of HA per strain, which is three times the standard 15 µg HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines. This substantiates the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim (antigen content) but does not, by itself, support the immunogenicity comparison. Since the task is to verify if the quote supports the claim, and the claim is twofold, the quote supports the antigen content aspect explicitly and factually.*

2. > Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60).
   
   *The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and punctuation. The document states: 'Higher magnitudes of haem agglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flu cel vax Tetra, Seq i rus, and Flu zone quad rival ent SD, San of i Pasteur 60).' This matches the quoted content in meaning and technical detail.. The quote directly supports the second part of the claim, stating that RIV4 (Flublok) elicits higher magnitudes of hemagglutination inhibitory antibody responses (a measure of immunogenicity) compared to standard-dose flu vaccines derived from eggs or mammalian cells. This is explicit evidence of greater immunogenicity. However, the quote does not address the first part of the claim regarding the 3x HA antigen content; it only addresses immunogenicity. Therefore, it supports the claim as far as immunogenicity is concerned, but not the antigen content.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS ≥18 yrs 45 µg/0.5 mL IM
   
   *The quote 'Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS ≥18 yrs 45 µg/0.5 mL IM' is present in the document, though with minor OCR artifacts. The relevant portion is: 'y µg RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine)' and the context of the table lists other vaccines with their µg/0.5 mL content, such as 'Flu zone Quad rival ent (San of i Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS†† ≥6 mos†† 15 µg/0.5 mL IM'. The document clearly lists Flublok (RIV4) as having 45 µg/0.5 mL, matching the quote's factual content.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by stating that Flublok contains 45 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose, which is three times the 15 µg/0.5 mL found in standard-dose flu vaccines (as shown for other vaccines in the same table). However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity; it only supports the antigen content comparison. Based solely on the document, the quote supports the claim about HA content but not the immunogenicity aspect.*

2. > Standard-dose, egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines contain 15 µg of HA per vaccine virus per 0.5 mL dose.
   
   *The quote's factual content appears in the document in several places, such as 'Flu zone Quad rival ent (San of i Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS†† ≥6 mos†† 15 µg/0.5 mL IM' and '( ) FluLaval Quad rival ent 0 5 mL PFS ≥6 mos 15 µg/0 5 mL'. These lines indicate that standard-dose, egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines contain 15 µg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, which is semantically equivalent to the quote provided.. The quote establishes that standard-dose, egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines contain 15 µg of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This provides the necessary baseline for comparison to Flublok, which is claimed to contain 3x the HA antigen content. While the document does not mention Flublok or its HA content directly, the quote does support the part of the claim regarding the HA content of standard-dose vaccines, which is a required component for substantiating the overall claim.*

#### Source: FlublokPI

**Text Evidence:**

1. > For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.
   
   *The quote appears in the document in the following passage: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, spacing), but all facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA per strain for three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain (45 mcg total) found in standard-dose flu vaccines, thus directly supporting the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Based solely on what is explicitly stated in the document, the quote supports the claim about antigen content but not the immunogenicity aspect.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 µg of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 µg total).
   
   *The quote appears on page 21 of the document, in the section titled 'Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine.' The text states: 'One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 µg of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 µg total).' This matches the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences and no substantive changes to the facts or numbers.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose. This is three times the 15 µg per virus found in standard-dose flu vaccines, as confirmed elsewhere in the document (see page 19: 'Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 µg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose'). The document also states that higher dose vaccines, including RIV4, have been linked to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines (see page 14: 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3'). Therefore, the quote directly and explicitly supports the claim regarding both the antigen content and the link to greater immunogenicity.*

2. > Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard dose in activated vaccines).
   
   *The quote appears on page 9 of the document: 'Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard dose in activated vaccines).' The numbers and facts match the quote to verify, and the context is about the antigen content per virus in these vaccines.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 µg of HA antigen per virus, which is three times the 15 µg per virus in standard-dose inactivated vaccines. This confirms the first part of the claim. The surrounding context in the document also discusses that higher antigen content is associated with greater immunogenicity, supporting the second part of the claim. Therefore, the quote both exists in the document and genuinely supports the claim as stated.*

3. > TABLE 1. Influenza vaccines - United States, 2022-23 influenza season... Flublok Quad rival ent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5 mL PFS ≥18 yrs 45 µg/0.5 mL IM... IIV4 (standard dose, egg based vaccines†)... 15 µg/0.5 mL IM¶
   
   *The quote is found in the document, specifically in Table 1 (Page 5) and in the descriptive text on Page 21. Table 1 lists 'Flublok Quad rival ent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5 mL PFS ≥18 yrs 45 µg/0.5 mL IM' and for standard-dose IIV4 (egg based vaccines), '15 µg/0.5 mL IM'. The table and associated text clearly show that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 µg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, while standard-dose IIV4 vaccines contain 15 µg per 0.5 mL dose. The numbers and technical content match the quote, though the formatting and some wording differ slightly due to table formatting and document structure.. The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines. The table and text explicitly state the HA content for both Flublok (45 µg/0.5 mL) and standard-dose IIV4 (15 µg/0.5 mL), confirming the 3x difference. Additionally, the document (Page 14) states that higher dose vaccines like RIV4 (Flublok) have been linked to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines, thus supporting both parts of the claim.*

4. > Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with non adjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard dose inactivated vaccines).
   
   *The quote appears on page 14 of the document: 'Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with non adjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard dose inactivated vaccines).' The factual content, numbers, and technical details are preserved and match the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 µg of HA antigen per virus, while standard-dose inactivated vaccines contain 15 µg per virus, confirming that Flublok contains 3 times the HA antigen of standard-dose vaccines. The surrounding text also discusses that higher HA antigen content is associated with greater immunogenicity, thus supporting the claim that this increased content has been linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.
   
   *The quote appears in the document in the following form: 'BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' This matches the quoted text in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').. The quote directly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines, which supports the first part of the claim. Additionally, elsewhere in the document, it is stated that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies, which is a measure of immunogenicity. Therefore, the quote, in conjunction with the surrounding context, genuinely supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines and that this has been linked to greater immunogenicity.*

2. > The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.
   
   *The quote appears in the document on page 2, with only minor formatting differences. The relevant passage is: 'The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.' This matches the quote to verify in all substantive facts and numbers.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, and that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. This supports both parts of the claim: the higher antigen content and the link to greater immunogenicity (as measured by protective antibodies) compared to standard-dose flu vaccines.*

3. > During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accord with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.
   
   *The quote appears on page 10 of the document, with only minor differences in wording. The document states: 'During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accord with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.' This matches the quote to be verified in both meaning and technical content.. The quote directly links the observed benefit (i.e., higher effectiveness) of the recombinant vaccine to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen. This supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen of standard-dose vaccines and that this increased HA content is associated with greater immunogenicity and effectiveness. The document also explicitly states in the background that the recombinant vaccine contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, and that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > a cell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain).
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document, though with some minor OCR artifacts and line breaks. The relevant passage is: 'acell culture based influenza vaccine (Flu cel vax Quad rival ent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quad rival ent by SanofiPasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d'. The full intended meaning is clear: RIV4 (Flublok) contains 3 times the intended 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain). The numbers and vaccine names match the quote, and the factual content is preserved.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok (RIV4) contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4). The second part of the claim, regarding greater immunogenicity, is also supported elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4'), but the quote itself is sufficient to substantiate the antigen content comparison.*

2. > In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell-A (H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.
   
   *The quote 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell-A (H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.' appears in the document, specifically in the first page of the provided text. The wording is nearly identical, and the factual content is preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (RIV4) leads to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4), as it states that RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell-A (H3N2) virus. While the quote does not explicitly mention the 3x HA antigen content, the document elsewhere confirms that RIV4 contains 3 times the HA content of standard-dose vaccines. Therefore, the quote provides direct evidence that the increased HA content in Flublok is associated with greater immunogenicity, supporting the claim.*

3. > In this randomized trial (Clinical trials gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg based (IIV4), cell culture based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines were compared. RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain).
   
   *The quote appears in the document on page 1: 'In this randomized trial (Clinical trials gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg based (IIV4), cell culture based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines were compared. RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d' and on page 9: 'IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain).' The quote as extracted is a cleaned and semantically accurate version of the original, stating that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 3 times the intended 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain).. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4). The second part of the claim, regarding greater immunogenicity, is also supported elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4'), but the quote itself is focused on the antigen content. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The vaccine (Flublok) used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses, provided by Protein Sciences Corporation.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording due to OCR artifacts. The key factual content is present: 'The vaccine (Flublok) used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses, provided by Protein Sciences Corporation.' This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences in punctuation and line breaks.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 45 mcg of each HA component per strain. While the quote does not mention the standard-dose flu vaccine content (15 mcg per strain), the explicit value of 45 mcg per strain is sufficient to substantiate that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content, as this is a well-established comparator. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim, but not the second part about immunogenicity.*

2. > The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses, provided by Protein Sciences Corporation. This is three times the amount of hemagglutinin present in standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines, which contain 15 mcg of each HA antigen.
   
   *The quote is found on page 2 of the document, in the section describing the vaccine used in the study. The relevant passage states: 'The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses, provided by Protein Sciences Corporation. This is three times the amount of hemagglutinin present in standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines, which contain 15 mcg of each HA antigen.' The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, specifying that Flublok contains 45 mcg of each HA antigen compared to 15 mcg in standard-dose vaccines. This addresses the first part of the claim. While the quote does not explicitly mention immunogenicity, it provides the factual basis (higher antigen content) that is linked to greater immunogenicity in the broader context of the document and claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated.*

### Claim 002: 

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor formatting differences. The content is semantically equivalent: 'POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.' This matches the quote to verify in all relevant factual content.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that traditional split or subunit influenza vaccines, which are produced in embryonated chicken eggs or mammalian host cells (i.e., cell- and egg-based vaccines), have the potential to acquire adaptive mutations in the HA (hemagglutinin) protein during manufacture. It further states that such mutations may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine. This is a direct and explicit confirmation of the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.*

2. > Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document, in the section discussing potential antigenic mismatch of influenza vaccine virus grown in egg or cells due to adaptive mutations. The text states: 'Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glut amine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'glutamine' split as 'glut amine'). All technical content and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a concrete example (from Raymond et al.) of a mutation (glutamine to arginine at position 226) arising during egg-based vaccine production, which led to the immune response being directed more toward the vaccine strain than the circulating wild type virus. This illustrates how such mutations can reduce vaccine effectiveness, as the antibodies produced may not optimally target the circulating virus. The document explicitly connects adaptive mutations during production to reduced effectiveness, thus substantiating the claim.*

3. > During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.
   
   *The quote appears in the section titled 'POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE.' The document states: 'During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156 Q, G186 V, and S219 Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.' The factual content, numbers, and technical details are preserved and match the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example where mutations (H156Q, G186V, and S219Y) developed during egg-based vaccine production, and explicitly states that these mutations were attributed to a reduction in vaccine effectiveness (41%) for H3N2 in the 2012-2013 season. This demonstrates that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness, as asserted in the claim.*

4. > Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document, in the section discussing the potential antigenic mismatch of influenza vaccine virus grown in egg or cells due to adaptive mutations in the HA primary structure. The sentence in the document reads: 'Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.' This matches the provided quote in both content and meaning.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness for H3 N2 in multiple influenza seasons. This demonstrates that mutations can develop during production (specifically in egg-based systems) and that these mutations may reduce vaccine effectiveness, which is exactly what the claim asserts.*

5. > During the 2014-2015 influenza season, a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26. For the 2016-2017 season, the influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26. However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document, though with minor wording differences. The factual content is preserved: 'During the 2014-2015 influenza season, a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain possessing anew predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26. For the 2016-2017 season, the influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26. However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26.' The meaning, technical content, and numbers are all present and match the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example where an egg-adapted influenza vaccine virus lost a glycosylation site during production, resulting in antibodies that poorly neutralized the circulating virus. This demonstrates that mutations (in this case, loss of a glycosylation site) can occur during production in eggs, and these mutations can reduce vaccine effectiveness. The quote is explicit and does not require inference beyond what is stated.*

6. > The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.
   
   *The quote 'The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.' appears in the document, near the end of page 6. The wording is an exact match, and the context is about how recombinant protein technology avoids the risk of antigenic mismatch that can arise from changes in HA structure during egg or cell adaptation.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that egg- or cell-based vaccine production carries a risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes (mutations) in the primary HA structure during adaptation, which is the basis for reduced effectiveness. The statement contrasts this risk with recombinant technology, which eliminates it, thereby affirming that the risk exists for egg- and cell-based vaccines.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.
   
   *The quote appears in the document in the following form: 'BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' This matches the provided quote in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').. The quote explicitly states that recombinant influenza vaccines are 'not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' By contrasting this with standard dose egg-based vaccines, it implies that egg-based vaccines are susceptible to antigenic drift (which is caused by mutations during production). Since antigenic drift can reduce vaccine effectiveness, this statement directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.*

2. > The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.
   
   *The quote appears on page 10 of the document: 'The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.' This matches the provided quote in both meaning and technical content, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'H3N2' vs 'H3 N2').. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the effectiveness of standard dose (egg-based) vaccines may be reduced ('attenuated') by antigenic drift (mutations) that occur during egg-based manufacturing. It also contrasts this with recombinant vaccines, which are not susceptible to such drift. This directly addresses the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness.*

1. > The manufacturing process can lead to egg adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population.
   
   *The quote appears in the first paragraph of the document, though with some minor OCR artifacts: 'manufacturing process can lead to egg adapted mutations in themagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered an ...iff i (VE) i h i l i'. Despite the artifacts, the semantic content matches the provided quote: the manufacturing process can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein in inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), which could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the manufacturing process (specifically for egg-based vaccines) can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, which could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness. This matches the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote does not mention cell-based vaccines developing mutations, but it does substantiate the risk for egg-based vaccines as described in the claim.*

2. > Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.
   
   *The quote 'Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.' appears in the document, specifically in the author list and summary section on page 1. The wording and meaning are preserved, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'immunogenicity' instead of 'immunogen i city', 'epitopes' instead of 'epi to pes'). The factual content is identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted (mutated) epitopes, which are not present on circulating viruses, and this can reduce immunogenicity (immune response) to the actual circulating viruses. This aligns with the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness.*

3. > Several studies have reported that Q223R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response.
   
   *The quote appears on page 9 of the document: 'have reported that Q223 R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1 N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigen i city and influence immune response 37 42.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'antigen i city' instead of 'antigenicity'). The factual content is preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example (Q223R mutation) that arises during egg-based production of the A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, and explicitly states that this mutation can alter antigenicity and influence immune response. This demonstrates that mutations can occur during production and may reduce vaccine effectiveness, thus supporting the claim.*

4. > Several studies have reported that Q223R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response 37 42.
   
   *The quote appears on page 9 of the document as: 'have reported that Q223 R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1 N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigen i city and influence immune response 37 42.' This matches the factual content of the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Q223R' vs 'Q223 R', 'antigenicity' vs 'antigen i city'). The meaning and technical content are preserved.. The quote directly states that the Q223R egg-adapted change (a mutation) at the HA head domain of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus can arise during egg-based vaccine production, and that it can alter antigenicity and influence immune response. This supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness, since changes in antigenicity and immune response are mechanisms by which effectiveness can be reduced.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **table_p3_det_2_003.png**: A multi-part table comparing amino acid sequences of hemagglutinin from cell-based versus egg-based influenza vaccine viruses across multiple strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Specific HA positions (e.g., 91, 121, 128, etc.) are listed as columns. Rows show the amino acids in cell-grown vaccine seed viruses and corresponding egg-grown candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). Egg-adapted substitutions are highlighted in bold/italic and glycosylation motif losses are marked “(CHO-)”. Evidence: Multiple egg-based vaccine viruses (e.g., A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 egg CVV, A/Kansas/14/2017 egg) display egg-adapted amino acid substitutions (italic/bold) and glycosylation motif losses (CHO-), which are absent in the cell-based counterparts. The table supports the claim by directly demonstrating that egg-based vaccine strains acquire specific HA mutations (including glycosylation motif losses) during production, which could alter antigenicity and potentially reduce vaccine effectiveness, thus supports the claim.

- **figure_p9_det_8_005.png**: Two-panel line graph showing, for age groups 18–44 years (A) and 45–64 years (B), the proportion of participants in seven repeat‐vaccination arms with ≥4‐fold reduced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer against cell‐grown vaccine virus (egg/cell titer ratio ≥4) before and one month after Year 2 vaccination. Results are shown for four vaccine components (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) with p-values for significant pre-to-post increases noted on trend lines. Seven vaccine arms (egg- and cell-based and recombinant combinations) are distinguished by different symbols and colors. Evidence: Significant increases in the proportion of participants with ≥4-fold reduced HI titer to cell-grown virus after vaccination for egg-based components (A(H1N1)pdm09 p=0.02, B/Victoria p=0.03 in 18–44 years; A(H3N2) p=0.04 in 45–64 years), indicating egg-adaptation mutations that reduce antibody recognition. The figure demonstrates that egg-based vaccine viruses acquire egg-adaptive mutations that lead to significantly reduced HI titers against the corresponding cell-grown virus, which supports the claim by showing production‐related mutations that can reduce vaccine effectiveness. Note: Some text and symbols are small and may be difficult to read, but key p-values and trends are legible.

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production for growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].
   
   *The quote appears on the first page of the document, with only minor differences in wording due to OCR artifacts. The relevant passage is: 'Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg pro growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].' This matches the quoted content in meaning and technical detail.. The quote explicitly states that the process of growing flu vaccines in eggs 'can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains.' This directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations (i.e., select for variants) during production, which may reduce their effectiveness if the resulting vaccine does not match circulating strains.*

2. > Although embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. For example, the ability to scale up egg production for growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].

The factual content and meaning are preserved, though the quote in the prompt is slightly cleaned up and condensed.. The quote directly states that the process of growing influenza viruses in eggs 'can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains.' This supports the claim that egg-based (and by extension, cell-based) vaccine production can lead to the selection of variants (mutations) that differ from circulating strains, potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness. The mention of insect cell/baculovirus systems is present, but the explicit support for the claim is strongest for egg-based systems. The quote does not contradict the claim and provides direct evidence for the possibility of mutations or changes during production that could impact effectiveness.*

### Claim 003: 

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > clearly demonstrate structural differences between HA pre fusion and post fusion states, and the presence of unique neutralising epitopes in the pre fusion HA0 molecules, which are present in RIV4 (Fig. 2). Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem in both mice and humans compared to egg derived split vaccines 64. Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.
   
   *The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording due to OCR correction, but all the key facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved. The passage discusses structural differences between HA in recombinant (RIV4) and split vaccines, the presence of unique neutralising epitopes in RIV4, and cites studies (Portnoff et al. and Richards et al.) showing that recombinant HA antigens induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies and more robust T-cell and antibody responses than conventional vaccines. The explanation about glycosylation and absence of other viral proteins in RIV4 is also present.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant technology (RIV4) leads to structural differences that result in both qualitative and quantitative differences in immune response, including significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies and more robust T-cell and antibody responses compared to conventional vaccines. The mention of 'broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions' and 'robust responses' provides direct evidence that recombinant vaccines can induce a broader immune response, which is the basis for potential cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.*

2. > RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3 N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3 N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3 N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3 N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of aglycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports 26.
   
   *The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording (e.g., 'antigenically' vs 'antigenic ally', 'Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3' vs 'Flu zone High Dose, SanofiPasteur; HD-IIV3'). All key facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved: the study by Belongia et al., the comparison of RIV4, HD-IIV3, and aIIV3, the testing against four A/H3N2 viruses (including drifted strains), the geometric mean fold rise being twice as high for RIV4, the similar low titres for drifted H3N2 but strong association of RIV4 with seroconversion (p = 0.003), and the explanation regarding egg propagation and impaired antibody response.. The quote directly supports the claim. It describes a study in which RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) induced broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses, with higher seroconversion rates to a drifted strain compared to other vaccines. This demonstrates that recombinant technology can lead to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, as the claim asserts. The data and interpretation provided in the quote are explicit and do not require inference.*

3. > In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutralising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.
   
   *The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording, but all key facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved.

These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.' This matches the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides evidence that RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) induces neutralising antibodies to both conserved (stem) and variable (head) regions of HA, with higher responses than conventional vaccines. It also notes that these responses are observed across multiple influenza subtypes and are highest in the elderly. The quote explicitly states that these findings warrant further study to determine if the broader antibody repertoire underlies the cross-protection against antigenic drift variants (i.e., mismatched strains) observed in clinical trials. Thus, the quote substantiates the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.*

4. > The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross protection against mismatched influenza strains 12 75. The study by Nachbagauer et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent influenza viruses similar to the multiple A/H3 N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82. Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against influenza.

The quote in the prompt is a cleaned and slightly reorganized version of the text found in the document, but all technical content, references, and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant technology (specifically rHA produced in insect cells) leads to a higher quantity and greater accessibility of the conserved HA stem region, which may contribute to cross-protection against mismatched influenza strains. It further cites studies showing that recombinant vaccines result in increased titres of broadly neutralising HA stem-reactive antibodies, and that these responses increase with age, possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent viruses.

This is a direct and explicit support of the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.*

5. > The evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional egg or mammalian cell derived vaccines, including the elimination of the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process impurities such as inactivating agents or residual egg protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza and or COVID-19.

It also mentions that these features are important for cross-protection against evolving variants, such as in pandemic influenza or COVID-19, which includes the context of a mismatch season. Thus, the quote provides direct and explicit support for the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.*

6. > The glycosylation of HA has various functions, including regulation of the virus life cycle and a role in disease pathogenesis71. During vaccine manufacture, the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in determining HA N-glycan composition 72 73. Glycoproteins expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated, paucimannosidic or oligomannosidic glycans)74. An et al.72 showed that egg derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cell derived HA predominantly contained highly branched complex or high mannose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9 insect cells had relatively small paucimannose glycans (Fig. 2)72. The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions could provide broader specificity. Antisera raised against simple monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine induced protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76-79.
   
   *The quote appears on page 5 and 6 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and word breaks, but all the key technical content and references are present. The passage discusses the glycosylation of HA, the impact of host cell on glycan composition, the differences between mammalian and insect cell-derived HA, and cites studies showing that simpler glycosylation (as in recombinant HA) leads to broader and more cross-protective antibody responses. The specific studies and conclusions about breadth and cross-clade protection are all present.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant technology (specifically, the use of insect cells to produce HA with simpler glycans) leads to the induction of more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross-clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans. It also references studies showing improved breadth and capacity of neutralizing antibodies, and discusses how targeting conserved glycosylation sites can provide broader specificity. This directly substantiates the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.*

1. > Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.
   
   *The quote appears in the document on page 4, in the section describing Study 1. The wording is nearly identical, with only minor formatting differences: 'Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.' The numbers, facts, and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) showed 44.8% efficacy against all influenza strains, regardless of antigenic match, in a season where 96% of circulating strains were not matched to the vaccine. This is explicit evidence of cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the core of the claim. The quote does not directly address the mechanism (broader immune response), but it does provide clear, specific evidence that recombinant technology (Flublok) provided protection even when the vaccine and circulating strains did not match.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **figure_p4_det_3_020.png**: A multi‐row table showing vaccine efficacy data for a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Flublok) versus a licensed inactivated quadrivalent vaccine. The table is divided into endpoints: culture‐confirmed influenza with strains represented in the vaccine, and culture‐confirmed influenza with any strain regardless of match. For each endpoint it lists case counts, attack rates per 100 subjects, vaccine efficacy (VE%) and 95% confidence intervals for matched strains and for all strains. Evidence: Vaccine efficacy of 44.6% (95% CI 18.8, 62.6) against all influenza strains regardless of match to the vaccine supports the claim because the recombinant vaccine demonstrated statistically significant protection against strains not matched to the vaccine, indicating cross‐protection even when circulating strains may be mismatched Note: The table does not explicitly specify a mismatch season; it reports efficacy against all strains irrespective of match rather than labeling a specific mismatch period.

   *The quote appears in the document on page 1, starting with 'A (H3 N2) immunogen i city. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating ...'. The factual content, vaccine names, and the context of improved antibody responses are preserved, though the quote is truncated in both the provided and source text.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (recombinant influenza vaccine) induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell-propagated (i.e., circulating) A (H3N2) virus than the other vaccine types, and that repeat vaccination with RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses. This supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, because higher and broader antibody responses to circulating (cell-propagated) viruses are explicitly described. The document does not require inference to connect these results to the claim.*

2. > After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg based vaccines generally reinforced the neutralizing antibody responses to egg adapted epitopes as evidenced by an increased trend in the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio ≥4. In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of participants with egg cell ratio ≥4 decreased or remained unchanged, suggesting that non egg based vaccines may redirect antibody responses away from egg adapted epitopes and towards epitopes present on circulating viruses.

The document states: 'After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg based vaccines generally reinforced the neutralizing antibody responses to egg adapted epi to pes as evidenced by an increased trend in the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio ≥4. In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of parti-' (the sentence continues but the meaning is clear and matches the quote). The extracted quote is a cleaned and semantically equivalent version of this passage.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that recombinant (RIV4) and cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccines do not reinforce antibody responses to egg-adapted epitopes, unlike egg-based vaccines. Instead, the proportion of participants with high egg/cell titer ratios decreased or remained unchanged, suggesting that these non-egg-based vaccines redirect the immune response away from egg-adapted epitopes and toward those present on circulating viruses. This implies a broader immune response, which is the basis for potential cross-protection in mismatch seasons, as the claim asserts.*

3. > Multiple seasons of non-egg based vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immune memory to egg adapted epitopes and re-focus the immune response towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness.
   
   *The quote appears on page 1 of the document, with only minor OCR-related differences: 'Multiple seasons of non-eg based vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immune memory to egg adapted epi to pes and re-focus the immune response towards epi to pes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effective nes.' The meaning and technical content are preserved, with 'non-eg based' instead of 'non-egg based', and 'epi to pes' instead of 'epitopes', which are clearly OCR artifacts.. The quote explicitly states that multiple seasons of non-egg based (including recombinant) vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from egg-adapted epitopes (which are a byproduct of egg-based vaccine production) to epitopes on circulating viruses. This implies that non-egg based vaccines can shift the immune response toward a broader set of viral targets, potentially improving vaccine effectiveness, especially in seasons where the vaccine and circulating strains are mismatched. Thus, the quote directly supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.*

4. > In contrast, among recipients of non egg based vaccines in just one study year (IIV4-ccIIV4 or IIV4-RIV4) or in both study years (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4), the proportion of participants with ≥4-fold reduced titer to cell vaccine virus did not increase, suggesting that non egg based vaccines may avoid repeated boosting of antibodies to egg adapted epitopes and instead maintain or broaden responses to epitopes present on circulating viruses.

The key content is present: 'In contrast, among recipients of non egg based vaccines in just one study year (IIV4-ccIIV4 or IIV4-RIV4) or in both study years (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4), the proportion of participants with ≥4-fold reduced titer to cell vaccine virus did not increase, suggesting that non egg based vaccines may avoid repeated boosting of antibodies to egg adapted epitopes and instead maintain or broaden responses to epitopes present on circulating viruses.' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and line breaks.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that non egg based vaccines (including recombinant and cell-based) do not increase the proportion of participants with reduced titer to cell vaccine virus, suggesting they avoid repeated boosting of antibodies to egg-adapted epitopes. Instead, they maintain or broaden responses to epitopes present on circulating viruses. This is explicit evidence that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, as the immune response is not narrowly focused on egg-adapted (potentially mismatched) epitopes.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **figure_p4_det_3_002.png**: Multi-panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) titers (log2 scale) for A(H3N2) viruses and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers for A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses. Four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) are compared at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination via scatter plots with GMTs and 95% CIs. P values above horizontal bars indicate statistical differences between groups at each time point. Evidence: At 1-month and 6-month time points against cell-propagated A(H3N2) antigens, the RIV4 group (orange) shows higher GMTs with multiple significant p values (e.g., p<0.0001, p=0.0003) compared to egg-based vaccines, indicating stronger cross-reactive antibody responses. The figure shows that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) elicits significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against cell-propagated, mismatched A(H3N2) strains at both 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, which supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: Sample sizes vary by group and age, data are antibody titers not clinical efficacy; some panels (e.g., B strains) show minimal differences.

- **figure_p6_det_5_006.png**: Multi-panel figure showing ELISA-measured antibody titers to HA head (egg and cell virus HA) for influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination (Panel A), the geometric mean ratios of egg to cell HA titers (Panel B), HA stalk-binding antibody titers for H3 and H1 stalk domains at the same time points (Panel C), and fold-rise of stalk titers from Day 0 to 1 month (Panel D). Four vaccine groups are color-coded: Fluzone IIV4 (gray), Fluarix IIV4 (blue), ccIIV4 (green), and recombinant HA vaccine RIV4 (orange). Statistical significance bars and p-values are shown. Evidence: Recombinant vaccine (RIV4) elicited significantly higher HA stalk antibody titers and greater fold-rise at 1 month post-vaccination compared to other groups, indicating a broader, cross-reactive immune response. supports the claim because the figure demonstrates that the recombinant HA vaccine induces stronger stalk-directed antibody responses—a correlate of broad cross-protection—even though mismatch-season efficacy is not directly measured, this broader immunity suggests potential cross-protection. Note: While stalk antibody responses suggest broader immunity, the figure does not directly assess clinical cross-protection in a mismatch season; efficacy data are not presented.

- **figure_p10_mrg_det_9_004.png**: The figure presents ELISA-measured geometric mean titers (GMTs) of hemagglutinin (HA) head and stalk binding antibodies at Day 0 and 1 month post‐vaccination across seven repeat vaccination arms: cell culture quadrivalent (ccIIV4), recombinant quadrivalent (RIV4), and egg-based quadrivalent (IIV4) used in various prime/boost combinations. Panels show head titers for H3N2, pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata antigens, ratios of egg‐ versus cell‐based head titers, stalk titers for H3 and H1, and fold‐rise of stalk antibody titers with 95% confidence intervals and reported p values for within‐group comparisons. Evidence: Statistically significant increases in H3 stalk antibody titers at 1 month post‐vaccination in recombinant‐containing arms (ccIIV4-RIV4 p=0.0001; RIV4-RIV4 p=0.004; IIV4-RIV4 p=0.03), and in H1 stalk antibodies in at least one recombinant arm (RIV4-ccIIV4 p=0.006). The data show that vaccination regimens including recombinant vaccine (RIV4) induce significantly higher HA stalk antibody responses, which are broadly cross-reactive, supporting the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. Note: The figure reports antibody titers and fold-rises but does not include direct clinical efficacy data in a mismatch season. Sample sizes per arm are modest, and cross-protection is inferred from stalk antibody levels rather than demonstrated by challenge or epidemiological outcomes.

This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences (e.g., line breaks, punctuation).. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that during a season with substantial antigenic mismatch (i.e., the vaccine did not match the circulating H3N2 viruses), the recombinant vaccine Flublok still provided significant protective efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition. This demonstrates cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim. The document does not explicitly attribute this to a 'broader immune response,' but it does show that the recombinant vaccine was effective even when the vaccine and circulating strains did not match, which is the core of the claim regarding cross-protection.*

1. > Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.
   
   *The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in wording and formatting. The factual content is preserved: Richards et al. examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine, or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018). The document states: 'RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity.' This matches the quote to be verified.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (the higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the egg-derived split vaccine (a standard-dose, egg-based vaccine) and cell-derived split vaccine. This is a direct comparison of antibody responses, showing that the recombinant vaccine induces a more robust antibody response than the standard egg-based vaccine, as claimed.*

2. > Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64.
   
   *The quote appears on page 5 of the document: 'Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64.' The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly compares recombinant HA antigens (as used in RIV4, a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) to egg-derived split vaccines, stating that the recombinant vaccine induced 'significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies.' This directly supports the claim that vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.*

3. > Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60.
   
   *The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and punctuation. The relevant sentence is: 'Higher magnitudes of haem agglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60.' The factual content, technical terms, and vaccine names are all preserved and match the quote to be verified.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (a recombinant influenza vaccine, which is higher-dose at 45 µg HA per strain) induces higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 compared to standard egg-based and mammalian cell-derived split vaccines (which are standard-dose). This is a direct comparison of antibody response magnitude between higher-dose recombinant and standard-dose egg-based vaccines, thus substantiating the claim without requiring inference.*

4. > In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3.
   
   *The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording (e.g., 'Belong i a et al.82' instead of 'Belongia et al.82', 'Flu zone High Dose, SanofiPasteur; HD-IIV3' instead of 'Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3'). The factual content, including the study design, age group, vaccines compared (RIV4, HD-IIV3, aIIV3), the viruses tested, and the result that the post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3, is preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It describes a study in which participants received either a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV4) or egg-based standard-dose/adjuvanted vaccines, and the antibody response (measured as geometric mean fold rise) against circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4. This provides explicit evidence that the higher-dose recombinant vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.*

5. > In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutralising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77.

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Quadivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.

   *The quote appears in the BACKGROUND section of the document: 'Quad rival ent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. Data are needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines against influenza related outcomes in adults under the age...' The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor differences in formatting and spacing (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadivalent'), but all factual content and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines. This is a key mechanistic fact supporting the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines, as hemagglutinin content is directly related to immunogenicity. While the quote does not explicitly state that the antibody response is more robust, it provides the specific factual basis (higher antigen dose) that underpins the claim, and thus genuinely supports it.*

2. > The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.

The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.' This matches the quote to verify, with the same technical details and numbers.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that the recombinant vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, and that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. This directly addresses the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines, by linking the higher dose to increased antibody levels.*

3. > The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.

The key factual content is preserved: the effectiveness of standard dose vaccines, the issue of antigenic drift in egg-based manufacturing, the lack of such drift in recombinant vaccines, the California Department of Public Health data about H3N2 circulation and mismatch, and the conclusion that the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine is more likely due to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen. The document states: 'The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3 N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season 18 and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines 19 20 During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3 N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overll in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.'. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine compared to the standard dose vaccine is in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen. This links the higher dose in the recombinant vaccine to greater effectiveness, which is consistent with the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines. The document also notes that increased hemagglutinin antigen is correlated with increased protective antibodies, further supporting the claim.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.
   
   *The quote 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.' appears in the document, specifically in the first page of the provided text. The wording and factual content are preserved, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'cell- A (H3 N2) virus' instead of 'cell-A (H3 N2) virus'). The meaning and technical content are identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (the higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to the cell-propagated A (H3 N2) virus than both ccIIV4 (cell-culture inactivated vaccine) and IIV4 (egg-based standard-dose vaccine) in year 1. This demonstrates that the higher-dose recombinant vaccine can induce a more robust antibody response than the standard-dose egg-based vaccine, as claimed.*

2. > RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody response in both 18–44 years and 45–64 years, it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4 A, Fig. S1 A).
   
   *The quote appears on page 9 of the document, though it is split by a line break and some intervening text. The relevant passage is: 'RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody ... years, it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4 A, Fig. S1 A).' The numbers and technical content match the quote to verify, and the meaning is preserved.. The quote explicitly states that RIV4 (the recombinant vaccine) contains 3 times the amount of HA per dose per strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (the standard-dose, egg-based and cell-based vaccines). It further states that, for A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody response but also significantly increased the quantity of total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies. This directly supports the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV4) may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.*

3. > The RIV4 group had the highest A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk and A (H3 N2) HA stalk antibodies at 1 month post vaccination, however the fold rises of HA stalk antibodies were low (<1.8) and similar among all 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 4 D).
   
   *The quote appears on page 5 of the document: 'The RIV4 group had the highest A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk and A (H3 N2) HA stalk antibodies at 1 month post vaccination, however the fold rises of HA stalk antibodies were low (<1.8) and similar among all 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 4 D).' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify.. The quote directly states that the RIV4 group had the highest levels of A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk and A (H3 N2) HA stalk antibodies at 1 month post vaccination, which supports the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV4) may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Although the fold rise was similar among groups, the absolute antibody levels were highest in the RIV4 group, which is relevant to the claim about a more robust response.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **figure_p4_det_3_002.png**: Multipanel figure showing antibody responses (MN titers for A(H3N2) and HI titers for H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) on a log₂ scale at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post‐vaccination in four groups: Fluzone IIV4 (egg‐based), Fluarix IIV4 (egg‐based), ccIIV4 (cell‐based), and RIV4 (recombinant). Gray dots represent individual titers; colored symbols and error bars show geometric mean titers (GMTs) with 95% CI. Horizontal bars with p values from Tukey’s multiple‐comparison tests indicate significant differences between vaccine groups at each time point. Evidence: At 1 month post‐vaccination, RIV4 (recombinant) shows significantly higher GMTs compared with egg‐based Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4 for A(H3N2) (p<0.0001) and H1N1pdm09 (p=0.003–0.015), as well as for B/Victoria and B/Yamagata strains (p=0.009–0.035). The figure supports the claim by directly showing that the higher‐dose recombinant vaccine (RIV4) induced significantly more robust antibody responses than the egg‐based standard‐dose vaccines at peak (1 month) and sustained (6 month) time points for multiple influenza strains. Note: Some text and p‐value annotations are small, but group differences and significance indicators are clear.

- **figure_p5_det_4_000.png**: Four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold-rise of microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody titers at 1-month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and geometric mean fold-reduction of antibody titers at 6-months post-vaccination (panels C and D) for adults aged 18–44 years (A, C) and 45–64 years (B, D). Four vaccine groups are compared for each influenza virus strain/propagation method (egg- or cell-propagated H3N2, H1N1, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata): Fluzone IIV4 (egg-based standard-dose), Fluarix IIV4 (egg-based standard-dose), ccIIV4 (cell-based), and RIV4 (recombinant high-dose). Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals and p-values from Tukey’s test indicate significant differences between RIV4 and egg-based vaccines. Evidence: In panels A and B, RIV4 (recombinant vaccine) consistently shows higher geometric mean fold-rise in antibody titers at 1 month compared with Fluzone IIV4 (egg-based), with p-values <0.05 across H3N2 egg, H3N2 cell, H1N1 egg, H1N1 cell, B/Victoria egg, B/Victoria cell, B/Yamagata egg, and B/Yamagata cell in both age groups. The figure shows that RIV4 induced significantly larger antibody responses at 1 month post-vaccination than the egg-based standard-dose Fluzone IIV4 across multiple strains and age groups, which supports the claim. Note: None

- **figure_p6_det_5_006.png**: A multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers to influenza HA antigens at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4). Panels include: A) ELISA titers for egg-grown and cell-grown HA of A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains; B) geometric mean ratios of egg- to cell-derived HA ELISA titers at 1 month; C) H3 and H1 stalk-binding antibody titers; D) fold-rise in stalk titers at 1 month versus baseline. Evidence: In Panel C, RIV4 (recombinant) elicits higher H3 and H1 stalk ELISA titers at 1 month versus Fluzone and Fluarix (p<0.05). In Panel D, RIV4 shows a greater fold-rise in stalk antibody titers at 1 month compared to egg-based vaccines. supports the claim because the recombinant RIV4 vaccine group exhibited statistically significant higher antibody titers and fold-rise in HA stalk responses at 1 month compared to egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: Data shown are serological titers with statistical comparisons; image quality allows clear assessment of p-values, but clinical efficacy is not addressed.

- **figure_p8_mrg_det_7_005.png**: Panel of four rows corresponding to influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. Within each row are four subplots showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post–year-2 vaccination against both egg-propagated and cell-propagated vaccine viruses. Box plots display geometric mean titers (GMTs) with 95% CIs for seven repeat vaccination arms (cclIV4-cclIV4, cclIV4-RIV4, RIV4-cclIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-cclIV4, IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-IIV4), and horizontal bars indicate statistically significant differences with p-values. Evidence: RIV4-RIV4 arm showed significantly higher post-vaccination GMTs compared with IIV4-IIV4 (egg-based) for cell-propagated A(H3N2) (p=0.015) and other strains (e.g., B/Yamagata p<0.0001). The figure shows that two consecutive doses of recombinant vaccine (RIV4-RIV4) induced higher HI antibody titers than two doses of egg-based standard vaccine (IIV4-IIV4), supporting the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: Only HAI titers are shown; clinical efficacy is not assessed. Dosing details are not explicit in the figure. Some text and labels are small and partially obscured.

Evidence: At Day 28, the recombinant high-dose vaccine induced higher HI geometric mean titers for all four strains (e.g., 174.5 vs 134.1 for A/H3N2) and higher seroconversion rates (e.g., 79.5% vs 63.0% for A/H3N2) compared with the egg-based standard-dose vaccine. The data show consistently higher antibody titers and seroconversion rates with the higher-dose recombinant vaccine versus the egg-based standard-dose vaccine, which supports the claim

   *The quote 'all adults, and supports its superior effectiveness over SD IIV4 for adults 18-64 years of age.' appears on page 6 of the document, in the section discussing the study's findings and strengths/limitations. The wording is an exact match, and the context is a summary of the study's results regarding the effectiveness of RIV4 compared to SD-IIV4 in adults 18-64 years old.. The quote directly states that the study supports the superior effectiveness of RIV4 (a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) over SD-IIV4 (egg-based standard-dose vaccine) for adults 18-64 years of age. This directly supports the claim that vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response (as measured by effectiveness) than egg-based standard-dose vaccines, at least in the specified age group.*

The safety analysis population included 4328 Flublok Quadrivalent recipients and 4344 Comparator vaccine recipients.' This matches the quoted content in all essential facts, numbers, and technical details.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Study 6 (the pivotal trial) enrolled subjects 50 years and older and randomized them to receive either Flublok Quadrivalent or Fluarix Quadrivalent (a standard-dose vaccine) as an active control. The numbers of recipients for each group are also provided. This confirms that Flublok Quadrivalent was evaluated in a pivotal trial against Fluarix Quadrivalent, as the claim asserts.*

2. > The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 - [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent / Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity ("matching") of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre-specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent relative to Comparator should be not less than 9.1%).
   
   *The quote appears on page 4 of the document, with only minor formatting and wording differences due to OCR cleanup. The content is semantically equivalent.

The document contains this information nearly verbatim, with only minor differences in punctuation and formatting.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Study 6 evaluated Flublok Quadrivalent against a Comparator, and elsewhere on the same page, the Comparator is clearly identified as 'Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.' The quote also describes the primary efficacy endpoint and the analysis performed, confirming that the pivotal trial compared Flublok Quadrivalent to Fluarix Quadrivalent. No inference is required; the information is explicit.*

This matches the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent' due to OCR artifacts), but all facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved.. The quote explicitly defines the Comparator in Study 6 as 'U.S.-licensed quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.' This directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine). The context and content confirm that the pivotal trial (Study 6) compared Flublok Quadrivalent to Fluarix Quadrivalent.*

The wording and technical content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').. The quote directly describes Study 6, stating that Flublok Quadrivalent was compared to a 'Comparator' and that relative vaccine efficacy was calculated between Flublok Quadrivalent and the Comparator. Additional context in the document (page 3 and 4) explicitly identifies the Comparator as Fluarix Quadrivalent, a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).*

   *The quote, 'In the current study, we compared the effectiveness of the high dose recombinant vaccine with that of standard dose vaccines in patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years,' appears on page 10 of the document. The wording is nearly identical, with only minor differences in phrasing (e.g., 'high dose recombinant vaccine' instead of 'Flublok Quadrivalent'), but the meaning and factual content are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the study compared the effectiveness of a high dose recombinant vaccine (which, per the document, is Flublok Quadrivalent) with standard dose vaccines. The document also clarifies elsewhere that Flublok Quadrivalent was the recombinant vaccine used, and Fluarix (a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine) was among the standard dose comparators. Therefore, the quote genuinely affirms that Flublok Quadrivalent was evaluated in the pivotal trial against a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine.*

2. > A strength of our study is that the two study vaccine formulations were alternated in weekly intervals of time at each facility, which allowed us to balance covariates of interest as designed. In every KPNC geographic area, when influenza arrived, there were already participants who had received one of the two formulations of vaccine and who were similar with respect to demographic characteristics, coexisting illnesses, and mortality at KPNC and nationwide in a similar age group.
   
   *The quote appears on page 10 of the document, with only minor paraphrasing and no substantive differences in meaning or technical content.

In every KPNC geographic area, when influenza arrived, there were already participants who had received one of the two formulations of vaccine and who were similar with respect to demographic characteristics, coexisting illnesses, and mortality at KPNC and nationwide in a similar age group.' This matches the quote provided, with all key facts and context preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the study alternated two vaccine formulations (the recombinant/high-dose vaccine, i.e., Flublok quadrivalent, and standard dose vaccines) weekly at each facility. This confirms that Flublok quadrivalent was evaluated against a standard dose vaccine in the pivotal trial, as the claim asserts. The quote also describes the study design in a way that substantiates the head-to-head comparison between these two vaccine types.*

   *A semantically equivalent quote appears on page 10: 'In this study performed during two influenza seasons, participants between the ages of 50 and 64 years who received the recombinant vaccine had more protection against confirmed influenza than those who received a standard dose vaccine.' This matches the provided quote in all key factual content, though the sentence is split by a page break in the OCR text. The meaning and data are preserved.. The quote directly states that the study compared a recombinant vaccine (Flublok quadrivalent) to a standard dose vaccine in participants aged 50-64, and that the recombinant vaccine provided more protection. The methods and results sections of the document confirm that the recombinant vaccine used was Flublok quadrivalent and that the comparator was a standard dose quadrivalent vaccine (Fluarix or similar). Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **figure_p4_det_3_002.png**: A multi-panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-based IIV4, and RIV4) against A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria (B/VIC), and B/Yamagata (B/YAM) strains. Evidence: The figure includes RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine, i.e., Flublok) and Fluarix IIV4 groups with direct statistical comparisons of antibody responses at each time point. supports the claim because the pivotal trial data shown directly compares RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine). Note: None

- **figure_p5_det_4_000.png**: Dot-and-error-bar plots showing geometric mean fold rise of antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and fold reduction of antibody titers at 6 months post-vaccination (panels C and D) for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) in two age cohorts (18–44 years and 45–64 years). Evidence: The figure includes RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent vaccine, i.e., Flublok) and Fluarix IIV4 arms compared directly in the same pivotal trial. The figure supports the claim because it shows RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) evaluated side-by-side with Fluarix IIV4, supports the claim

- **figure_p6_det_5_006.png**: A multi-panel ELISA data figure showing geometric mean antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) across influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata antigens, plus head/stalk subdomain analyses and egg/cell HA titer ratios. Evidence: The figure explicitly lists Fluarix IIV4 and RIV4 (the recombinant quadrivalent vaccine, i.e., Flublok) as two of the four arms, indicating direct comparison of RIV4 versus Fluarix IIV4 in the trial data. supports the claim because the figure shows that RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) was evaluated alongside Fluarix IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine) in the same pivotal trial data. Note: The image uses the abbreviation RIV4 rather than the brand name Flublok; assuming RIV4 corresponds to Flublok QIV based on standard terminology.

- **figure_p7_mrg_det_6_003.png**: Four-panel figure showing geometric mean ratios of egg- versus cell-grown vaccine virus titers (panels A and B) and proportions of subjects with ≥4-fold reduction in titer (panels C and D) at pre- and 1-month post-vaccination for four quadrivalent vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) in two age groups (18–44 and 45–64 years). Data points and statistical comparisons are indicated for each vaccine strain (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM). Evidence: The figure legend and data panels include both Fluarix IIV4 (black circles) and RIV4 (orange circles) in the same pivotal immunogenicity study, directly comparing post-vaccination antibody responses between these vaccines. The figure supports the claim by presenting immunogenicity data from the same trial that directly compares Flublok (RIV4) with Fluarix IIV4, demonstrating evaluation of RIV4 against the standard-dose Fluarix vaccine. Note: The figure clearly shows a head-to-head comparison but does not explicitly label this study as the 'pivotal trial'; interpretation assumes this is the primary immunogenicity study for licensure.

Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults 50 years old, but not for adults 65 years old [11].' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote explicitly states that a randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok) with standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4). This directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine. The document also clarifies elsewhere that RIV4 is Flublok and SD-IIV4 includes Fluarix, confirming the claim's accuracy.*

The factual content and vaccine brand names are identical.. The quote explicitly lists the vaccine brands included in the study, stating that RIV4 was Flublok and that SD-IIV4 included Fluarix (among others). This directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), as it confirms both vaccines were used as comparators in the study.*

   *The quote 'c RIV4: Flublok. c SD-IIV4: Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, Standard Dose Flu zone and FlucelVax.' appears on page 4 of the document. The content is semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., the use of 'c' as a footnote marker). It explicitly lists Flublok as RIV4 and Fluarix as one of the SD-IIV4 comparators.. The quote directly supports the claim because it identifies Flublok as RIV4 and Fluarix as one of the SD-IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine) comparators. This means that in the pivotal trial described in the document, Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), as the claim asserts.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.
   
   *The quote appears in the document on page 2, with only minor formatting and OCR-related differences. The factual content is preserved: it states that the recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok®, Supemtek®) was the first licensed influenza vaccine produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens from live influenza virus, and that its production is based on a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The description of expresSF+ insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, is also present.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The technical details about the use of expresSF+ insect cells, recombinant baculovirus, and the polyhedrin promoter further substantiate the claim. No inference is required; the quote matches the claim exactly.*

The relevant passage is: 'The influenza vaccine field has been constantly evolving to imp improve the breadth and longevity of the protective immune re vaccines in development. Among these, the recombinant influen system to express recombinant haem agglutinin (rHA) in insect studied extensively.' While the sentence is broken up and some words are missing or garbled, the key facts are present: RIV4 (recombinant influenza vaccine, which is Flublok) uses a baculovirus expression vector system to express recombinant HA in insect cells, and it is the only one to have reached the market and has been studied extensively.. The quote, as found in the document, directly states that the recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4/Flublok) uses a baculovirus expression vector system to express recombinant HA in insect cells. This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).

1. > These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from both egg and cell propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens), and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk, and A (H3 N2) HA stalk). rHA from egg- and cell A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1 N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3 N2), B/ Colorado 06 2017 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 1 sera; rHA from egg- A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1 N1) pdm09 and cell-A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1 N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3 N2), egg- and cell- B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/ Victoria), egg- and cell-B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 2 sera. The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.
   
   *The quote appears on page 11 of the document, in the section describing the ELISA methods: 'These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from both egg and cell propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens), and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk, and A (H3 N2) HA stalk). rHA from egg- and cell A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1 N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3 N2), B/ Colorado 06 2017 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 1 sera; rHA from egg- A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1 N1) pdm09 and cell-A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1 N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3 N2), egg- and cell- B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/ Victoria), egg- and cell-B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 2 sera. The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.' The factual content and technical details match the quote to verify.. The quote explicitly states that the recombinant HA proteins (rHA) used in the study were 'expressed from the baculovirus system,' which is a direct reference to the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). This supports the claim that Flublok (the recombinant influenza vaccine, RIV4) is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS. The quote does not mention insect cells directly, but the use of the baculovirus system for recombinant HA production is well-established as involving insect cells, and the document is specifically discussing the recombinant vaccine platform. Therefore, the quote genuinely and directly supports the claim as stated.*

2. > The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.
   
   *The quote 'The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.' appears on page 11 of the document. The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'baculo virus' vs 'baculovirus'), but the factual content is preserved.. The quote directly states that recombinant HA proteins (the antigen in Flublok) were expressed using the baculovirus system. This is the core of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) platform. While the quote does not explicitly mention 'insect cells,' it does explicitly state the use of the baculovirus system for recombinant HA production, which is the key novel platform referenced in the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated, based solely on the explicit content in the document.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0.' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation), but all technical details and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok is produced by expressing recombinant HA in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The quote is explicit and does not require inference, so it genuinely supports the claim.*

2. > Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDC derived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor formatting and OCR differences: 'Genes were cloned into baculo virus using RT-PCR from the same Cd ce rived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed nactivated influenza vaccine for that year.' This matches the quoted content in meaning and technical detail.. The quote directly describes a key step in the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS): cloning genes into baculovirus. This is consistent with the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS. The quote provides explicit evidence that the production process involves inserting genes into baculovirus, which is central to BEVS technology.*

3. > Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus expression system as previously described [9].
   
   *A semantically equivalent quote appears on page 2: 'The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of puried hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculo virus expression system as previously described [9].' This matches the factual content of the quote to verify: 'Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus expression system as previously described [9].' The only difference is minor wording and the explicit mention of Flublok, but the meaning and technical content are preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok's hemagglutinin proteins are produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system, which is the core of the claim. While the quote does not use the acronym BEVS, it describes the process (expression in insect cells using baculovirus), which is what BEVS stands for. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system.*

4. > Among the available expression technologies, recombinant baculovirus is especially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because the rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this vector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expression of the HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus also avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live influenza viruses, and the attendant biocontainment issues that would be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines [7]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for seasonal influenza.
   
   *The quote appears on page 6 of the document, starting with 'Among the available expression technologies, recombinant baculovirus is especially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because the rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this vector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expression of the HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus also avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live influenza viruses, and the attendant biocontainment issues that would be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines [7]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for seasonal influenza.' The content and meaning are preserved, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote explicitly states that recombinant baculovirus is used to express the HA protein in insect cells for influenza vaccine production. This directly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The quote provides both the rationale and the technical details matching the claim.*

5. > The current study provides evidence of protective efficacy of baculovirus derived HA vaccine in adults for prevention of seasonal influenza and supports that significant protection in a primed population can be obtained against influenza with a pure hemagglutinin vaccine.
   
   *The quote appears on page 6 of the document, in the following form: 'The current study provides evidence of protective efficacy of baculo virus derived HA vaccine in adults for prevention of sea- sonal influenza and supports that significant protection in a primed population can be obtained against influenza with apure hemagutinin vaccine.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, 'baculo virus' instead of 'baculovirus', 'hemagutinin' instead of 'hemagglutinin'). The factual content and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly refers to the vaccine as a 'baculo virus derived HA vaccine,' which, in the context of the document, is Flublok. Earlier in the document, it is explicitly stated that Flublok is 'produced in insect cells using baculo virus expression system.' Therefore, the quote confirms that Flublok is produced using a baculovirus-based system to express hemagglutinin (HA) in insect cells, which is the essence of the claim. The quote thus genuinely supports the claim.*

6. > Development of influenza vaccines that do not use embryonated eggs as the substrate for vaccine production is a high priority. We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy of a recombinant, baculovirus expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (Flublok®).
   
   *The quote appears in the document, though with minor formatting and OCR differences.

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy acomb in ant, baculo virus expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (Flublok®).' This matches the factual content of the quote to verify, stating that Flublok is a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed hemagglutinin vaccine, and that it is not produced using embryonated eggs.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok is a recombinant vaccine in which hemagglutinin is expressed using a baculovirus system, and that it is developed as an alternative to egg-based production. This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).*

### Claim 007: 

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem compared to egg derived split vaccines 64.
   
   *A semantically equivalent quote appears on page 5: 'Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem compared to egg derived split vaccines 64.' This matches the provided quote in all key factual content, including the reference to BEVS, recombinant HA, higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies, conserved regions of HA, and comparison to egg-derived vaccines.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS (as in RIV4) induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem compared to egg-derived split vaccines. This matches the claim's assertion regarding the immunogenic superiority of BEVS-derived recombinant HA antigens over egg-derived vaccines in terms of inducing broadly cross-reactive antibodies.*

2. > In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutralising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60.
   
   *The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording. The factual content is preserved: 'In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutralising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60.' The content and meaning are semantically equivalent to the provided quote.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (a BEVS-produced recombinant HA vaccine) induces higher levels of antibodies specific to both the HA stem (a highly conserved region) and the HA head, compared to both egg-derived and mammalian cell-derived vaccines. It also notes that these responses are observed in both humans and mice, and that the magnitude of the haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response is higher with RIV4. This directly substantiates the claim that BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.*

3. > RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenic ally drifted A/H3 N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belong i a et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion in activated trivalent influenza vaccine (Flu zone High Dose, SanofiPasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3 N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenic ally advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3.
   
   *The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording (e.g., 'antigenic ally' vs 'antigenically', 'Belong i a et al.82' vs 'Belongia et al.82', 'Flu zone High Dose, SanofiPasteur; HD-IIV3' vs 'Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3'). The factual content, numbers, and technical details are preserved. The quote describes a study comparing RIV4 (a BEVS-produced recombinant HA vaccine) to high-dose split virion and adjuvanted egg-derived vaccines, showing that RIV4 induced a geometric mean fold rise in antibodies against two circulating viruses that was twice as high as the comparators.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides explicit evidence that RIV4, a recombinant HA antigen produced using BEVS, induces significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against antigenically drifted (and thus more conserved) A/H3N2 viruses compared with egg-derived vaccines. The study cited in the quote measured antibody responses to multiple A/H3N2 viruses, including drifted strains, and found RIV4 elicited a greater fold rise in antibodies than both high-dose and adjuvanted egg-derived vaccines. This directly substantiates the claim regarding the superior cross-reactive antibody induction of BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **figure_p6_det_5_006.png**: Multi-panel figure showing ELISA-measured antibody responses to influenza HA. Panel A: total HA binding titers (log2) for egg-derived and cell-derived HA antigens (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluad IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4). Panel B: geometric mean ratio of egg/cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month. Panel C: H3 stalk and H1 stalk antibody titers (log2) at Day 0, 1 month, 6 months post-vaccination, with pairwise p-values. Panel D: geometric mean fold-rise (1 month/Day 0) of H3 and H1 stalk titers with 95% CI. Evidence: In Panel C, at 1 month post-vaccination RIV4 (recombinant HA) elicits significantly higher H3 stalk and H1 stalk ELISA titers than egg-based Fluzone IIV4 (p<0.0001). supports the claim because the RIV4 group, produced via BEVS, shows significantly greater induction of stalk-directed (highly conserved region) antibodies compared with the egg-derived vaccine group. Note: Some p-value text is small; group labels are inferred from color legend but overall differences are clear.

### Claim 008: 

#### Source: Arunachalam_et_al.__2021_

**Text Evidence:**

1. > The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor formatting differences. The document states: 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains.' This matches the quoted content in all relevant factual details.. The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 micrograms (µg) of HA per dose from each of the four strains. This explicitly supports the part of the claim regarding Flublok's HA content. While the quote does not mention the 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose influenza vaccines, it does provide the specific number for Flublok, which is the main focus of the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated.*

**Text Evidence:**

1. > RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) 0.5-mL SDV ≥18 yrs 45 µg/0.5 mL IM
   
   *The quote 'RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) 0.5-mL SDV ≥18 yrs 45 µg/0.5 mL IM' is present in the document, though it appears with some minor OCR artifacts. The key facts—RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine), 0.5-mL single-dose vial, for ages ≥18 years, and 45 µg/0.5 mL administered intramuscularly—are all present and semantically equivalent to the quote provided.. The quote directly states that the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok) contains 45 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, as compared to the standard-dose influenza vaccine, which is also shown in the document as containing 15 mcg of HA per strain. The quote provides explicit, numerical support for the claim.*

2. > Fluzone Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS ≥6 mos 15 µg/0.5 mL IM
   
   *The quote 'Fluzone Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS ≥6 mos 15 µg/0.5 mL IM' is present in the document, though with minor formatting differences due to OCR artifacts. The document states: 'Flu zone Quad rival ent (San of i Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS†† ≥6 mos†† 15 µg/0.5 mL IM', which is semantically and factually equivalent.. The quote directly states that the standard-dose influenza vaccine (Fluzone Quadrivalent) contains 15 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This fact is necessary to support the claim's comparison between Flublok (45 mcg HA/strain) and standard-dose vaccines (15 mcg HA/strain). While the quote does not mention Flublok, it provides the standard-dose value, which is a required part of the claim.*

3. > FluLaval Quad rival ent 0 5 mL PFS ≥6 mos 15 µg/0 5 mL
   
   *The quote 'FluLaval Quad rival ent 0 5 mL PFS ≥6 mos 15 µg/0 5 mL' appears in the document, with only minor spacing differences due to OCR artifacts. The factual content, including the vaccine name (FluLaval Quadrivalent), dose (0.5 mL), age indication (≥6 months), and HA content (15 µg/0.5 mL), is preserved.. The quote provides explicit information that a standard-dose influenza vaccine (FluLaval Quadrivalent) contains 15 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This directly supports the claim's comparison of HA content per strain in standard-dose vaccines versus Flublok, by establishing the standard-dose value.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **figure_p2_det_1_000.png**: A table listing various influenza vaccines with columns for trade name (manufacturer), presentation, age indication, μg HA per strain per dose, route, and mercury content. Under 'RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine)' it lists Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) as 0.5-mL PFS, ≥18 yrs, 45 μg/0.5 mL, IM. Under IIV4 it lists vaccines with 15 μg/0.5 mL. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur): 45 μg/0.5 mL; IIV4 vaccines: 15 μg/0.5 mL per strain The table directly shows Flublok contains 45 μg HA per strain per dose versus 15 μg per strain in standard-dose IIV4 vaccines, which supports the claim

The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, punctuation). All numbers and strain names match.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain for each of the three influenza virus strains, for a total of 135 mcg per 0.5 mL dose. This explicitly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, which is three times the 15 mcg per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine (as referenced in the claim, though the standard-dose value is not stated in this quote, the Flublok value is directly confirmed).*

2. > Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.

**Text Evidence:**

1. > Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 µg of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 µg total).
   
   *The quote appears on page 21 of the document under the section 'Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine.' The text states: 'One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 µg of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 µg total).' This matches the quote to be verified, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'µg' vs 'mcg', 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent'), but all factual content and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 45 micrograms (µg) of HA per strain (per vaccine virus) in a 0.5-mL dose. The document also provides, in Table 1 and elsewhere, that standard-dose influenza vaccines contain 15 µg of HA per strain. Therefore, the quote explicitly and directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 micrograms of HA per strain versus 15 micrograms per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.*

2. > Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 µg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose (7.5 µg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.25-mL dose). For 2022-23, this category is expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1).

For 2022-23, this category is expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1).' The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote provided.. The quote directly states that standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 vaccines contain 15 micrograms (µg) of HA per strain in a 0.5-mL dose, which matches the claim's assertion about standard-dose influenza vaccines. While the quote does not mention Flublok or its 45 µg HA content, it provides the specific comparator value (15 µg per strain) necessary to support the claim's comparison. The document elsewhere (page 21) confirms that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 µg of HA per strain, so the quote, in context, genuinely supports the claim.*

3. > Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard dose in activated vaccines).

The wording and numbers match the quote to verify, and the context is a direct comparison of HA content per strain in these vaccines.. The quote explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 µg of HA per strain, while standard dose inactivated vaccines contain 15 µg per strain. This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.

   *The quoted content appears in the document, specifically in the section labeled 'TABLE 1. Influenza vaccines - United States, 2022-23 influenza season.' The table lists 'Afluria Quadrivalent (Seqirus)' as a standard-dose IIV4 with '15 µg/0.5 mL' HA per strain, and 'Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur)' with '45 µg/0.5 mL' HA per strain. The quote accurately reflects the factual content and numbers presented in the table, even though there are minor OCR artifacts and formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain, while a standard-dose influenza vaccine (such as Afluria Quadrivalent) contains 15 mcg of HA per strain. This matches the claim's assertion about the difference in HA content per strain between Flublok and standard-dose influenza vaccines.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **table_p5_det_4_002.png**: A table of U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines listing vaccine name (by subtype and manufacturer), presentation, age indication, hemagglutinin (HA) amount per strain per dose, route, and dose volume. Categories include standard-dose egg-based, cell culture–based, high-dose egg-based, MF59-adjuvanted, recombinant HA, and intranasal vaccines. Evidence: Under the recombinant HA vaccine category, Flublok Quadrivalent is shown with 45 µg of HA per strain (0.5 mL IM); under standard-dose egg-based and cell culture–based IIV4 entries, the HA amount is 15 µg per strain (0.5 mL IM). The table shows Flublok contains 45 µg HA per strain versus 15 µg per strain in standard-dose vaccines, which supports the claim.

**Text Evidence:**

1. > BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.
   
   *The quote appears in the document in the 'BACKGROUND' section: 'Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' This matches the quoted text in both meaning and factual content.. The quote directly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines. Since the standard dose is known to be 15 mcg per strain, this supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg per strain (3 x 15 mcg = 45 mcg). The document does not explicitly state the microgram amounts, but the 'three times' statement is a direct factual basis for the claim.*

2. > The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.
   
   *The quote appears in the document on page 2: 'The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines. Since the standard dose is 15 mcg per strain (a widely accepted fact in influenza vaccine literature, but not directly stated in this document), the quote provides the necessary ratio (3x) to support the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg per strain versus 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose vaccines. The document does not state the microgram amounts directly, but the 3x relationship is sufficient to substantiate the claim as framed.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **figure_p1_det_0_017.png**: Title and abstract of an article comparing recombinant and standard-dose influenza vaccines in adults under 65 years, including a sentence stating that trivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines. Evidence: “Trivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines.” The statement that recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein compared to standard-dose vaccines supports the claim that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) delivers 45 mcg per strain versus 15 mcg per strain in a standard-dose vaccine. Note: The image does not explicitly name Flublok or specify the 45 mcg and 15 mcg values; it only provides the 3-fold relationship.

   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'acell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by SanofiPasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d'. While the sentence is partially obscured by OCR artifacts, it clearly states that RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 3 times the [amount] 45 HA/d[ose]/... compared to the other vaccine. This matches the factual content of the quote to be verified.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 3 times the amount of HA (hemagglutinin) per dose, specifically 45 micrograms, compared to standard-dose vaccines (which are known to contain 15 micrograms per strain). This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.*

2. > IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody
   
   *The quote 'IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody' appears on page 9 of the document. The factual content and numbers are preserved, specifically the statement that IIV4 and ccIIV4 contain 15 µg HA per dose per strain.. The quote directly states that IIV4 and ccIIV4 (standard-dose influenza vaccines) contain 15 µg HA per dose per strain. This is the comparator for Flublok (RIV4), which is described elsewhere in the document as containing 3 times the amount (i.e., 45 µg HA per strain). Thus, the quote provides explicit factual support for the claim regarding the HA content of standard-dose influenza vaccines versus Flublok.*

   *The quote appears on page 1 of the document, in the following form: 'acell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d'. While the sentence is partially garbled due to OCR issues, it clearly states that RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 3 times the [amount] and '45 HA/d...' (interpreted as 45 mcg HA per dose/strain), which matches the factual content of the quote to be verified.. The quote explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 3 times the amount of HA (hemagglutinin antigen) per dose compared to standard vaccines, and references '45 HA/d...' (interpreted as 45 mcg HA per dose/strain). This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg in standard-dose influenza vaccines.*

1. > The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006, A/Wisconsin/67/2005, and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses.
   
   *The quote appears on page 2 of the document, in the section describing the vaccine used in the study. The text states: 'The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006, A/Wisconsin/67/2005, and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses.' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly states that the trivalent Flublok vaccine contained 45 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain. This explicitly supports the part of the claim regarding Flublok's HA content per strain. However, the quote does not mention the HA content of standard-dose influenza vaccines (15 mcg per strain), so it only directly supports the Flublok portion of the claim. Since the claim is a comparison and the quote provides one side of that comparison with explicit numbers, it genuinely supports the claim as far as the document allows.*

2. > Subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injection of saline placebo (2304 subjects), or trivalent Flublok containing 45 mcg of each rHA0 component (2344 subjects).
   
   *The quote appears on page 1 of the document, though with minor formatting and OCR differences. The relevant passage is: 'Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injection of saline placebo (2304 subjects), or trivalent Flublok containing 45 mcg of each rHA0 component (2344 subjects).' This matches the factual content of the quote to verify.. The quote directly states that the trivalent Flublok vaccine contains 45 micrograms of each rHA0 (hemagglutinin) component. This explicitly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain. While the quote does not mention the 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose influenza vaccine, it fully substantiates the part of the claim regarding Flublok's HA content.*

**Visual Evidence:**

- **table_p5_det_4_014.png**: A table listing seasonal influenza vaccines for the 2021–2022 season, including product name, vaccine type, route, approved age, and HA per dose for each vaccine. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) is shown with 45 mcg HA per strain (180 mcg total), whereas standard-dose egg-based and cell culture–based IIV4 vaccines are listed with 15 mcg HA per strain (60 mcg total). The table explicitly shows that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose influenza vaccines, which supports the claim.
