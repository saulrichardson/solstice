Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that is circulating is eliminated.",
              "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the primary amino acid sequence of the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. It further states that this process eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch with the circulating wild type flu virus, which is what the WHO and FDA select for each season. Therefore, the quote genuinely and explicitly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains."

It explicitly states that recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch caused by changes in the HA structure during egg or cell adaptation, which is a problem in conventional vaccine production. This means the antigen in Flublok remains identical to the selected reference strain, as required by the claim."

RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
              "explanation": "The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose per strain. While the quote does not explicitly compare this to the standard 15 \u00b5g per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines, it provides the specific HA content for Flublok, which is the key fact in the first part of the claim. The document elsewhere (page 3) mentions that standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (such as Fluarix Quadrivalent) are given at 15 \u00b5g per strain, allowing a direct comparison. However, the quote itself does not address immunogenicity or make a direct link to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim (3x HA content), but does not, by itself, support the second part (link to greater immunogenicity)."

Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",

It explicitly states that traditional split or subunit vaccines (which are cell- and egg-based) have the potential to acquire adaptive mutations during growth in embryonated chicken eggs or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. It further states that such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine.

It provides a specific example of a mutation (glutamine to arginine at position 226) arising during egg-based vaccine production, and explains that this mutation altered the immune response such that antibodies preferentially bound to the vaccine-derived HA rather than the circulating wild type virus. This demonstrates that mutations can occur during production and may reduce vaccine effectiveness, as the claim asserts."

Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26.",

It provides a concrete example where an egg-adapted vaccine virus lost a glycosylation site during production, and as a result, antibodies induced by the vaccine poorly neutralized the circulating strain that retained the glycosylation site. This demonstrates that mutations (in this case, loss of a glycosylation site) can occur during production in eggs, and these mutations can reduce vaccine effectiveness.

Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.",

Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64. Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",

Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of aglycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports 26.",

It describes a clinical study showing that RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) induces broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted (mismatched) A/H3N2 viruses in humans. The data show that RIV4 recipients had a higher geometric mean fold rise against circulating viruses and a statistically significant association with seroconversion to an antigenically drifted strain, even when overall titers were low.

RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60.

The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.

This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent influenza viruses similar to the multiple A/H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82.

All of these viruses were A/Wisconsin/67/2005 like H3N2 viruses. Two of these occurred in Flublok recipients and 6 occurred in placebo recipients, and among these subjects one Flublok recipient and 5 placebo recipients met the CDC-ILI definition. Therefore, we were unable to obtain a meaningful estimate of the efficacy of Flublok against CDC-ILI due to strains represented in the vaccine. The remaining 111 influenza A viruses were characterized as antigenic variants, i.e., they exhibited a 4 fold or greater decrease in reactivity with post infection ferret antisera in reciprocal HAI testing. These viruses included 12 H1N1 viruses antigenically resembling H1 drift variant A/Brisbane/59/2007, 41 H3N2 viruses antigenically resembling the H3 drift variant A/Brisbane/10/2007, 2 H3N2 viruses that could not be identified as either A/Wisconsin-like or A/Brisbane-like, and 16 influenza viruses for which the subtype was not determined. Fifty eight of the 59 influenza B viruses (98%) were antigenically similar to B/Florida/04/2006, presenting a different clade from the vaccine strain, and one influenza B virus could not be antigenically characterized. The cumulative rates of culture confirmed influenza illness ...",

The passage details that the vast majority of circulating viruses were antigenic variants (i.e., mismatched to the vaccine), and that there were too few matched cases to estimate efficacy against matched strains. The context of the study, as described elsewhere in the document, is that Flublok still demonstrated protective efficacy in this setting, implying cross-protection. The quote provides the factual basis for the claim by showing the predominance of mismatched strains and the continued measurement of efficacy, thus substantiating the claim without requiring inference beyond what is stated."

Two single season randomized trials of RIV versus non adjuvanted SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus non adjuvanted SD-IIV3 that assessed culture confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus non adjuvanted SD-IIV4 that examined PCR-confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged \u226565 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: \u221217% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate). The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over non adjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged \u226550 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10\u201347 as well as in a qualified ILI endpoint among those aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 42%; 95% CI: 9%\u201365%) (68).",

RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22.
