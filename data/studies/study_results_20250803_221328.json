Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculo virus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that circulates in the community is eliminated.",
              "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production, and that this eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch. Since the WHO and FDA select the reference strains for seasonal influenza vaccines, this means Flublok's HA antigenic match is identical to those selected strains, as claimed."

              "explanation": "The quote directly states that recombinant protein technology (as used in Flublok) eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch caused by changes in the HA structure during egg or cell adaptation, which are issues in traditional vaccine manufacturing. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it avoids the adaptive mutations that can cause mismatches. The document further explains that the primary amino acid sequence of the recombinant HA is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for vaccine production, reinforcing the claim."

The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3 N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3 N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",
              "explanation": "The quote is found in the document and directly links the observed benefit of the recombinant (Flublok) vaccine to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen. It states that the greater effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine against influenza A overall is in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen. This supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines and that this increased HA content is associated with greater immunogenicity and protection compared to standard-dose vaccines."

Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",
              "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that traditional split or subunit influenza vaccines, which are produced in embryonated chicken eggs or mammalian host cells, have the potential to acquire adaptive mutations during manufacture. It further states that such mutations in the HA (hemagglutinin) peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine. This is a direct affirmation of the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness."

It provides a specific example (Raymond et al.) where an egg-adapted influenza vaccine strain acquired a mutation (glutamine to arginine at position 226) during production. This mutation altered the immune response, causing antibodies to preferentially bind the vaccine-derived HA rather than the circulating wild type virus, which could reduce vaccine effectiveness. This is explicit evidence that mutations can arise during egg-based vaccine production and may impact effectiveness, as the claim asserts."

The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.",

It provides a concrete example where mutations (H156Q, G186V, S219Y) acquired during egg-based vaccine production were linked to reduced vaccine effectiveness (41%) in the 2012-2013 flu season.

It explicitly states that antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness in multiple influenza seasons, specifically for H3N2.

              "quote": "The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus.",
              "explanation": "The quote directly addresses the claim. It states that there is a chance (albeit low due to quality control) of introducing deleterious mutations during the adaptation of seed virus in egg or cell-based manufacturing, and that such mutations can occur during vaccine production. It further explains that recombinant DNA technology avoids this risk because it does not use live virus. This supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."

Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64. Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",

The mention of 'broadly cross reactive antibodies' and 'robust responses' provides direct evidence for a broader immune response, and the context of 'highly conserved regions' and 'cross reactive' implies potential for cross-protection, even in seasons where there is a mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains.

Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of aglycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports 26.",

The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process impurities such as inactivating agents or residual egg protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza and or COVID-19.",

This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent influenza viruses similar to the multiple A/H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82.

During vaccine manufacture, the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in determining HA N-glycan composition 72 73. Glycoproteins expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated, paucimannosidic or oligomannosidic glycans)74. An et al.72 showed that egg derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cell derived HA predominantly contained highly branched complex or high mannose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9 insect cells had relatively small paucimannose glycans (Fig. 2)72. The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions could provide broader specificity. Antisera raised against simple monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine induced protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76-79.",

It states that the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing (implying a broader immune response), and that during a season when the circulating strain was poorly matched to both vaccine types, the recombinant vaccine still showed a benefit over the standard dose vaccine. The authors specifically note that the observed benefit is more likely due to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall in a mismatch season, which supports the idea of broader immune response and potential cross-protection even when there is a mismatch."

Four vaccine groups are compared: two egg-based standard-dose IIV4s (Fluzone, Fluarix), a cell-culture IIV4, and a recombinant vaccine (RIV4). P-values are annotated above comparisons indicating statistical differences in titers between RIV4 and the egg-based vaccines. Evidence: Numerous significant p-values (e.g., <0.0001, 0.003, 0.045) show that RIV4 (orange) elicits higher microneutralization titers than egg-based IIV4s at 1 and 6 months for A(H3N2) across both age groups and virus origins, as well as significant higher HI titers for A(H1N1)pdm09 and some B strains. The figure supports the claim because the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) induced significantly higher antibody responses than the egg-based standard-dose vaccines across multiple strains, age groups, and time points, demonstrating a more robust immune response. Note: While the data clearly show higher titers for RIV4 in most comparisons, the figure does not indicate actual vaccine dose levels, and some strains (e.g., B/Victoria) show no significant differences.

Among the available expression technologies, recombinant baculovirus is especially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because the rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this vector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expression of the HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus also avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live influenza viruses, and the attendant biocontainment issues that would be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines [7]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for seasonal influenza.",

Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production, as well as the adaptation of candidate vaccine viruses for growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2]. Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has been developed as an alternative approach.",

It explicitly contrasts traditional egg-based influenza vaccine production with an alternative method: 'Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has been developed as an alternative approach.' This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The document also elsewhere confirms that Flublok uses this method. Therefore, the quote both exists in the document and genuinely supports the claim."

Evidence: In panels C and D, the recombinant HA vaccine (orange) elicits significantly higher H3 and H1 stalk ELISA titers and fold-rise at 1 month compared with egg-derived vaccines (p values <0.05). The figure shows that the BEVS-produced recombinant HA vaccine induces higher levels of antibodies against the conserved HA stalk region than egg-derived vaccines (p<0.05), which supports the claim.

One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
