During vaccine manufacture, the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in determining HA N-glycan composition 72 73. Glycoproteins expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated, paucimannosidic or oligomannosidic glycans)74. An et al.72 showed that egg derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cell derived HA predominantly contained highly branched complex or high mannose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9 insect cells had relatively small paucimannose glycans (Fig. 2)72. The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions could provide broader specificity. Antisera raised against simple monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine induced protection.

However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.' This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences (e.g., line breaks, punctuation).. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that during a season with substantial antigenic mismatch (i.e., the vaccine did not match the circulating H3N2 viruses), the recombinant vaccine Flublok still provided significant protective efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition. This demonstrates cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim. The document does not explicitly attribute this to a 'broader immune response,' but it does show that the recombinant vaccine was effective even when the vaccine and circulating strains did not match, which is the core of the claim regarding cross-protection.",

It also notes that these responses are observed in both humans and mice, and that the magnitude of the haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response is higher with RIV4.

RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d'. While the sentence is partially garbled due to OCR issues, it clearly states that RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 3 times the [amount] and '45 HA/d...' (interpreted as 45 mcg HA per dose/strain), which matches the factual content of the quote to be verified.. The quote explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 3 times the amount of HA (hemagglutinin antigen) per dose compared to standard vaccines, and references '45 HA/d...' (interpreted as 45 mcg HA per dose/strain). This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg in standard-dose influenza vaccines.",

This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly states that the trivalent Flublok vaccine contained 45 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain. This explicitly supports the part of the claim regarding Flublok's HA content per strain. However, the quote does not mention the HA content of standard-dose influenza vaccines (15 mcg per strain), so it only directly supports the Flublok portion of the claim. Since the claim is a comparison and the quote provides one side of that comparison with explicit numbers, it genuinely supports the claim as far as the document allows.",
