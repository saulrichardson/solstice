(1)' appears almost verbatim in the document on page 1 under the section DOSAGE FORMS AND ADMINISTRATION.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok is approved for use in persons 18 years of age and older, which directly supports the claim that Flublok Quadrivalent is approved for adults 18 years and older."

The wording is slightly spaced and split but the core content matches exactly.. The quote indicates that Flublok Quadrivalent has been administered to adults 18 years and older, with safety data collected from these age groups, which directly supports the claim that Flublok Quadrivalent is approved for adults 18 years and older."

The safety analysis population included 998 recipients of Flublok Quad rival ent and 332 Comparator vaccine recipients.' The wording is slightly different with some spacing and line breaks, but the core content matches exactly.. The quote directly states that Study 7 enrolled subjects aged 18 through 49 years to receive Flublok Quadrivalent, showing that the vaccine was studied in adults 18 years and older. This supports the claim that Flublok Quadrivalent is approved for adults 18 years and older, as clinical studies including this age group are a basis for such approval."
