The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. It explicitly states that recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to changes in HA structure from egg or cell adaptation, which is a key problem in traditional vaccine manufacturing.

This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, and line breaks).. The quote directly supports the claim. It reports that, in a head-to-head study, the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) induced a post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise in antibody titers against two circulating A/H3N2 viruses that was twice as high as that induced by the high-dose egg-based vaccine (HD-IIV3) or the adjuvanted egg-based vaccine (aIIV3). This is explicit evidence that the higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose (and even high-dose or adjuvanted) vaccines."

The study by Nachbagauer et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age78.' This matches the provided quote in all substantive details.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that recombinant vaccines (such as RIV4, a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) result in increased titres of broadly neutralising HA stem reactive antibodies, and that these immune responses increase with age. This is a direct indication of a more robust antibody response compared to standard (egg-based) vaccines, as the claim asserts. The quote does not compare directly to standard-dose egg-based vaccines in this sentence, but the context of the document and the explicit mention of increased titres and robust immune responses from recombinant vaccines substantiate the claim."

This matches the provided quote in all key factual content, including the comparison of BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens to egg-derived vaccines, the higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies, and the focus on highly conserved regions of HA.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS (as in RIV4) induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem compared to egg-derived split vaccines. This is exactly what the claim asserts, with no need for inference or assumption."
