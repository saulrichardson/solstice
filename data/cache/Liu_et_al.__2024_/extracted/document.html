<div class="text">Repeat vaccination with egg-based inﬂuenza vaccines could preferentially<br>boost antibodies targeting the egg-adapted epitopes and reduce immuno-<br>genicity to circulating viruses. In this randomized trial (Clinicaltrials.gov:<br>NCT03722589), sera pre- and post-vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated<br>egg-based (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) inﬂuenza<br>vaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018−19<br>(N = 723) and 2019−20 (N = 684) inﬂuenza seasons. We performed an<br>exploratory analysis. Vaccine egg-adapted changes had the most impact on<br>A(H3N2) immunogenicity. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total<br>HA head binding antibodies to cell- A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year<br>2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-<br>ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with<br>either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating<br>viruses with decreased neutralizing antibody egg/cell ratio. RIV4 also had<br>higher post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in<br>year 1, but there was no signiﬁcant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise<br>among vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2. Multiple seasons of non-egg-<br>based vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from<br>immune memory to egg-adapted epitopes and re-focus the immune responses<br>towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness.</div>

RIV4 contains 3 times the<br>antigen dose at 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to the standard dose<br>IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain). Both ccIIV4 and RIV4 are cur-<br>rently licensed in the US7. Clinical trials evaluating ccIIV and RIV have<br>shown comparable to advantageous immunogenicity compared to<br>standard-dose egg-based IIVs in different age groups8–13. Observational<br>studies and clinical trials reported that ccIIV and RIV demonstrated<br>modest to signiﬁcant improvement of VE over egg-based IIV in dif-<br>ferent age groups and inﬂuenza seasons7,14–16.<br>Repeat annual inﬂuenza vaccination is another factor that may<br>affect the antibody responses elicited by inﬂuenza vaccines. Studies<br>indicated that frequent prior vaccination could blunt the antibody<br>responses to inﬂuenza vaccination over time11,13,17–21 which can lead to<br>reduced vaccine effectiveness22–26. One study reported that repeat<br>vaccination reduced antibody afﬁnity maturation to the HA antigens of<br>all vaccine components from egg-based, cell-culture based, and<br>recombinant inﬂuenza vaccines20. Thus far, there are few direct com-<br>parisons of immunogenicity of the three vaccine platforms in popu-<br>lations with a history of frequent inﬂuenza vaccinations. We recently<br>reported the comparison of immunogenicity of ccIIV and RIV to egg-<br>based standard dose IIVs among US healthcare personnel (HCP) aged<br>18−64 years from a randomized, open-label trial during the 2018−2019<br>season27 and the 2019−2020 season following repeat vaccination in 2<br>consecutive years28,29. Those comparisons were focused on the neu-<br>tralizing antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses only.<br>RIV4 elicited higher neutralizing antibody responses than IIV4 against<br>cell-propagated vaccine viruses27. Repeat vaccination with ccIIV4 or<br>RIV4 in 2 seasons also resulted in signiﬁcantly higher post-vaccination<br>antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses29. Most HCP<br>participants had received egg-based inﬂuenza vaccines frequently<br>during the preceding ﬁve seasons.</div>

<div class="text">We previously reported that antibodies targeting the egg-adapted<br>epitopes could be preferentially boosted from repeat vaccination with<br>egg-based vaccines3. The potential of non-egg-based vaccines to miti-<br>gate the impact of prior egg-based vaccination remains unclear.

The post-vaccination<br>neutralizing antibody GMT egg/cell titer ratio was the most pro-<br>nounced for A(H3N2), with elevated MN GMT egg/cell titer ratios in all<br>vaccine groups (Fig. 5A, B), suggesting vaccination induced signiﬁcant<br>levels of neutralizing antibody responses targeting A(H3N2) egg-<br>adapted epitopes related to 158 (CHO-), 194 P, and 225 G (Table 1).

<div class="text">Next, to assess whether vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines<br>can overcome the impact of egg-adaptation and reduce the GMT egg/<br>cell ratio in the vaccine responses, we calculated the “proportion of the<br>participants with egg/cell ratio ≥4” in MN/HI titers at pre- and 1-month<br>post-vaccination (Fig. 5C, D). At pre-vaccination, there was no sig-<br>niﬁcant difference in the proportion of participants with GMT egg/cell<br>ratio ≥4 among the 4 vaccine groups. At baseline, around 40% of<br>participants had GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 to A(H3N2) and B/Victoria<br>viruses, suggesting a high prevalence of pre-existing neutralizing<br>antibodies targeting HA egg-adapted epitopes in this highly vaccinated<br>HCP population. After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg-<br>based<br>vaccines<br>generally<br>reinforced<br>the<br>neutralizing<br>antibody<br>responses to egg-adapted epitopes as evidenced by an increased trend<br>in the proportion of participants with GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4. In<br>contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of parti-<br>cipants with GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4 was overall lower at 1-month<br>post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination (Fig. 5C, D), demon-<br>strating the potential of non-egg-based vaccines to reduce the neu-<br>tralizing antibody response difference to egg versus cell viruses. Most<br>notably, only in the RIV4 groups to A(H3N2) virus, the proportions of<br>GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4-fold were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01) decreased<br>in both age groups (from 58% down to 26% in 18−44 years, and from<br>40% down to 21% in 45−64 years), suggesting RIV4 vaccination can<br>potentially mitigate the pre-existing antibody memory to egg-adapted<br>epitopes by improving the magnitude of neutralizing antibody<br>responses to cell-propagated viruses (Fig. 5C, D).</div>
<div class="text">We then also analyzed the HA binding antibody “GMT egg/cell titer<br>ratio” measured by ELISA. Similar trend was observed as with MN/HI<br>antibodies that GMT egg/cell ratios were higher (p < 0.05) in the egg-<br>based IIV4 groups than those in the ccIIV4 and RIV4 groups for A(H3N2)<br>HA head and B/VIC HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4B). However, the<br>GMT egg/cell HA binding antibody ratios (Fig. 4B) were around 1 for all</div>

<div class="title">Discussion</div>
<div class="text">In this study, we compared the antibody responses to egg- versus cell-<br>propagated vaccine viruses following vaccination with RIV4, ccIIV4 or<br>IIV4 among HCP aged 18−44 and 45−64 years. RIV4 induced more<br>robust HI and MN antibody responses than ccIIV4 and egg-based IIV4<br>against multiple vaccine strains including cell-propagated A(H3N2),<br>consistent with previous reports9,13,15,27–29. Our analysis also indicates<br>that repeat vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines could overcome<br>pre-existing egg/cell titer differences in neutralizing antibody levels by<br>re-directing vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses away<br>from egg-adapted epitopes, resulting in higher antibody responses to<br>circulating cell-grown viruses, even with frequent prior vaccination<br>with egg-based inﬂuenza vaccines in HCP.<br>Reported VE against A(H3N2) virus was low during the 2016−17 to<br>2018−19 seasons despite the absence of apparent antigenic drift of the<br>circulating viruses1,4,31. The egg-adapted changes on the HA head<br>domain in the egg-grown A(H3N2) vaccine virus: T160K, L194P, and<br>D225G resulted in an “antigenic mismatch” from circulating strains that<br>likely contributed to the low observed VE3,5,6.

<div class="text">of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies targeting 158 (loss of glycosy-<br>lation caused by T160K) 194P, and 225G epitopes, likely due to the prior<br>repeat vaccination with egg-based vaccines. More than 68% of the HCP<br>in this study received inﬂuenza egg-based vaccine in all ﬁve preceding<br>inﬂuenza seasons (Table 2). The imprinting effect of egg-based vac-<br>cines could be lifelong resulting in a persistence of antibodies targeting<br>egg-adapted sites that could be preferentially reinforced following<br>repeat egg-based vaccination3. This may impede the quality of anti-<br>body response to the circulating inﬂuenza strains and negatively affect<br>VE. Our study suggests that non-egg-based vaccines, especially RIV4,<br>might circumvent the effect of repeat vaccination with egg-based<br>inﬂuenza vaccines that contain egg-adapted changes.<br>Repeat vaccination can lead to reduced VE23,32,33. In year 1, the<br>frequent prior repeat egg-based vaccinations may blunt the antibody<br>responses to the subsequent vaccination as reﬂected by the limited<br>fold rise in MN/HI antibody titers (Fig. 3).

In a highly vaccinated population such as HCP, an effective<br>vaccine should be able to overcome issues with both repeat vaccina-<br>tion and vaccine egg-adapted mutations.

In year 2, all 4<br>repeat vaccination arms with non-egg-based vaccines (ccIIV-ccIIV4,<br>ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4) further reduced the proportion of<br>participants with HI GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 against A(H3N2) to less than<br>10% (Fig. 7), of which 3 in 18−44 years group (ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4,<br>RIV4-RIV4) and 2 in 45−64 years group (ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-RIV4)</div>

<div class="text">Furthermore, the difference in antigenicity and egg-adaption<br>between vaccine viruses from consecutive inﬂuenza seasons could<br>further confound the effect of repeat vaccination. The A(H3N2) vaccine<br>virus in year 2 was updated to a 3 C.3a A/Kansas/14/2017-like virus,<br>which is genetically and antigenically distant from the 3 C.2a vaccine<br>virus A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 in year 1. Year 2 vaccine virus<br>A/Kansas/14/2017 virus bears different egg-adapted changes at D190N<br>and N246T but possess 194 L and 225D that are the same as cell-<br>propagated A(H3N2) vaccine virus in Year 1 (Table 1). This could have<br>also contributed to the improved antibody response to the cell-grown<br>A(H3N2) vaccine virus after the repeat vaccination in year 2. Thus far,<br>most reported VE from repeated vaccination studies were from egg-<br>based vaccines, evaluation of whether repeat vaccination with non-egg-<br>based vaccines will improve VE, especially for A(H3N2), is warranted.<br>To fully characterize the quantity as well as the quality of the<br>antibody responses, we measured both functional, neutralizing anti-<br>body responses to egg- versus cell- propagated viruses (by MN or HI),<br>and the total HA binding antibodies (by ELISA) that include both<br>neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody responses. For RIV4, both<br>increased antigen dose and the absence of egg-adapted mutations may<br>have led to the improved immunogenicity13.

However, for<br>A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses, the difference in HI antibody versus the<br>total HA head binding antibody levels among 4 vaccine groups was less<br>consistent, suggesting that the magnitude of improvement differ<br>between subtypes and were likely determined by the relative immu-<br>nodominance of the egg-adapted HA epitopes for each subtype. In<br>addition, the egg/cell HA head binding ELISA titer ratios were around 1<br>for all vaccine antigen subtypes irrespective of vaccine platforms<br>(Fig. 4B), suggesting the total HA binding antibody responses induced<br>by vaccination cannot differentiate egg-adapted epitopes on HA even<br>for A(H3N2). This is in stark contrast to the highly elevated egg/cell<br>GMT ratio in neutralizing antibody responses to egg- vs cell-A(H3N2)<br>viruses (Fig. 5A, B), highlighting the importance of inducing high<br>quality, neutralizing antibody responses from vaccination.<br>Our study also demonstrated that the impact of vaccine egg-<br>adaption may differ between inﬂuenza virus subtypes, with the biggest<br>impact on neutralizing antibodies to A(H3N2) and moderate impact for<br>inﬂuenza B vaccine viruses.

<div class="text">The impact of egg-adaptation was the least profound on the<br>antibody response to A(H1N1)pdm09. Both Year 1 and Year 2 A(H1N1)<br>pdm09 vaccine viruses bear egg-adapted change at HA Q223R. Studies<br>have reported that Q223R egg-adapted change at the HA head domain<br>of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter<br>antigenicity and inﬂuence immune response37–42. In this study, 1-month<br>post-vaccination GMTs to both egg- and cell-propagated A(H1N1)<br>pdm09 vaccine viruses in year 1 were similar among the 4 vaccine<br>groups, with GMT egg/cell titer ratio around 1.0, and the proportion of<br>HCP with egg/cell titer ratio ≥4 was only 2−11% (Fig. 5), indicating a less<br>immunodominant role of Q223R change. Furthermore, the two egg<br>IIV4 vaccines induced similar antibody responses to A(H1N1)pdm09<br>viruses regardless of the variation at 223. These ﬁndings are consistent<br>with our previous report in which we found that among over 300<br>adults who received egg-based A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines with Q223R<br>egg-adapted epitope during 5 inﬂuenza seasons, only 9% of partici-<br>pants mounted antibodies speciﬁc to 223R38.<br>Multiple immune mechanisms can contribute to the protection<br>from inﬂuenza infection. Broadly cross-reactive HA stalk antibodies<br>have been considered as one of the targets for universal vaccine<br>development. Here, we assessed both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2)<br>HA stalk antibody responses in all vaccine groups in both years. When<br>comparing the post-vs pre-vaccination HA stalk antibody levels,<br>vaccination induced HA stalk antibody rise in several vaccine groups<br>and repeat vaccination arms. However, the levels of geometric mean<br>titer fold rise were low (close to 1, Figs. 4D, 8D) with no signiﬁcant<br>difference in fold rise among different vaccine groups in both years,<br>even in RIV4 group that received 3 times more antigen doses; the<br>difference in HA stalk antibody titers post-vaccination mostly mir-<br>rored the difference in pre-existing HA stalk antibody levels. To this<br>end, development of next generations vaccines that can induce<br>multiple arms of immune responses could improve the effectiveness<br>of the vaccines.</div>

<div class="text">Human immunity to inﬂuenza is quite complex and present chal-<br>lenges to improve vaccine effectiveness. Immune priming can play dual<br>roles and is largely directed by the immunodominance of imprinted HA<br>epitopes upon ﬁrst exposure to inﬂuenza antigen, as well as the repe-<br>ated inﬂuenza exposures by vaccinations or infections later in<br>lifetime3,38. Here, our study demonstrated how immunodominant egg-<br>adapted epitopes on A(H3N2) HA can impact the immunogenicity from<br>repeated vaccination. Collectively with previous reports3, ﬁndings from<br>this study could provide a few meaningful insights to improve vacci-<br>nation strategy. First, for those who were repeat vaccinated with egg-<br>based vaccines such as HCP and older adults, vaccination with non-egg-<br>based vaccines could be especially beneﬁcial; second, it would also be<br>important not to prime naive children with egg-adapted epitopes3, it<br>might be necessary to immunize naive children with non-egg-based<br>inﬂuenza vaccines as their ﬁrst priming dose. In addition, improved<br>vaccine formulations, such as higher vaccine doses and the use of<br>adjuvants, could also improve vaccine immunogenicity.<br>Our study has several limitations. First, we only compared the<br>immunogenicity of egg- vs non-egg-based vaccines in two inﬂuenza<br>seasons. The effect of the vaccine egg-adapted changes on vaccine<br>immunogenicity will vary by season depending on the antigenic<br>properties of the vaccine viruses. A(H3N2) vaccine was updated to a</div>
<div class="text">within the same age group (A). One-way ANOVA corrected for multiple compar-<br>sons (Tukey’s test) was used to compare the GMTs of stalk binding antibody at<br>each time point among the 4 vaccine groups (C). One-way ANOVA nonparametri<br>Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the fold changes among the 4 vaccine<br>groups (B, D).Statistically signiﬁcant differences between groups are indicated by p<br>values on the horizontal bars (A, C). *In (C), paired t test (two-tailed) was used fo<br>comparing the pre- and 1 m post-vaccination stalk antibody titers within the sam<br>vaccine group: signiﬁcantly higher HA stalk antibody titers were detected in 1 m<br>post-vaccination than pre-vaccination for H3 stalk antibody titers in ccIIV4-RIV4<br>p = 0.0001), RIV4-RIV4 (p = 0.004), IIV4-ccIIV4 (p = 0.03), IIV4-RIV4 (p = 0.03); and<br>or H1 stalk antibodies in ccIIV4-ccIIV4 (p = 0.008), RIV4-ccIIV4 (p = 0.006).</div>
<div class="text">3 C.2a virus in 2021−2022 inﬂuenza season with the same T160K egg-<br>adapted change in the egg-based vaccines and was updated again in<br>2022−23 and 2023−24 seasons with the egg-based vaccines carrying a<br>different set of egg-adapted mutations30, thus, continued effort is<br>needed to assess vaccine immunogenicity and VE. Second, we only<br>focused on the antibody responses to HA. RIV4 lacks the neur-<br>aminidase (NA) component that also could contribute to the protec-<br>tive efﬁcacy of inﬂuenza vaccines. Thus, whether the improved<br>antibody responses to HA alone in RIV4 will translate into improved<br>vaccine efﬁcacy and effectiveness still needs to be assessed. Other<br>humoral immune responses, such as antibody responses to NA,<br>mucosal and cell-mediated immunity, also contribute to protection.<br>Lastly, no correction for multiple comparisons was done because this<br>was an exploratory analysis.</div>
<div class="text">Taken together, our study demonstrated that multiple seasons of<br>vaccination with non-egg-based inﬂuenza vaccines can improve HA-<br>mediated antibody immunogenicity to cell-propagated viruses repre-<br>senting circulating strains. Our ﬁndings support the use of antibody<br>responses to cell-propagated viruses, rather than to egg-propagated<br>vaccine viruses, as the primary endpoint in future immunogenicity<br>studies for licensure or comparison of inﬂuenza vaccines.

Study design</div>
<div class="text">y<br>g<br>The original study was a randomized, open-label trial conducted in the<br>United States during the Northern Hemisphere 2018−2019 (Year 1) and<br>2019−2020 (Year 2) inﬂuenza seasons. This study is an exploratory<br>analysis. The detailed participant enrollment, randomization, and<br>blinding were previously described27–29. Participant characterisitcs in<br>year 1 are described in Table 2. During Year 1, HCP were stratiﬁed by two<br>age groups (18−44 years and 45−64 years) and randomized at 4:4:2:2<br>ratio to receive one of four quadrivalent vaccines: ccIIV4 (Flucelvax),<br>RIV4 (Flublok), Fluzone IIV4 or Fluarix IIV4 (Fig. 1). Serum samples were<br>collected at baseline (day 0 pre-vaccination), 1-month, and 6-months<br>post-vaccination. The Year 2 study was designed to evaluate the anti-<br>body responses following 7 different Year 1-Year 2 repeat vaccination<br>regimens: IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone), IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-<br>RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4 (Fig. 1). Serum samples were col-<br>lected at baseline (day 0) and 1-month post-vaccination.<br>Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4, the two egg-based vaccines were<br>analyzed separately for this exploratory analysis because the two<br>vaccines have different egg-adaptated mutation on the HA of the<br>A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV (Table 1). Fluzone has Q223R substitution<br>which was associated with focused antibody response to 223R in some<br>vaccinees as we previously reported38, while the A(H1N1)pdm09 egg<br>CVV in Fluarix had 223Q. In addition, the current analysis is also age-<br>stratiﬁed by 18−44 years and 45−64 years age groups as we previously<br>observed that the impact of vaccine egg-adaptation on antibody<br>response to A(H3N2) virus may be age-related3.</div>

Egg-grown<br>A(H3N2) viruses were propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken<br>eggs, cell-grown A(H3N2) viruses were propagated in stably transfected<br>MDCK cells with cDNA of human<br>2,6-sialyltransferase<br>(MDCK-<br>SIAT1 cells). Egg- and cell (MDCK-SIAT1)-grown A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-<br>0019/2016 viruses were tested in MN assays in year 1 using MDCK-SIAT1<br>cells using methods as previously described44. In Year 2, egg- and cell-<br>propagated A/Kansas/14/2017 viruses were tested by HI assays using<br>0.75% guinea pig erythrocytes in the presence of 20 nM oseltamivir.</div>

These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the<br>total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from<br>both egg-and cell-propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens),<br>and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk, and A(H3N2) HA<br>stalk). rHA from egg- and cell A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09, rHA<br>head from egg- and cell- A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2), B/<br>Colorado/06/2017 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata)<br>were tested with year 1 sera; rHA from egg- A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)<br>pdm09 and cell-A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1N1)pdm09, rHA head from egg- and<br>cell- A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2), egg- and cell- B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/<br>Victoria), egg- and cell-B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested<br>with year 2 sera. The puriﬁed and trimeric recombinant HA proteins<br>were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established<br>procedures45. For ELISA, rHA antigens were coated at 100 ng/well. Serum<br>samples were tested at an initial dilution of 1:400 followed by 2-fold<br>serial dilution. Antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase<br>(HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human pan immunoglobulin conjugate to<br>detect total binding antibodies. ELISA was performed based on pre-<br>viously described procedures46,47. The ELISA titers were determined as<br>the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum samples that achieved an<br>optical density (OD) value of 0.2 or greater.</div>
