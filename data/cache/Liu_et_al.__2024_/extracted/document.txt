Repeat vaccination with egg-based inﬂuenza vaccines could preferentially
boost antibodies targeting the egg-adapted epitopes and reduce immuno-
genicity to circulating viruses. In this randomized trial (Clinicaltrials.gov:
NCT03722589), sera pre- and post-vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated
egg-based (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) inﬂuenza
vaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018−19
(N = 723) and 2019−20 (N = 684) inﬂuenza seasons. We performed an
exploratory analysis. Vaccine egg-adapted changes had the most impact on
A(H3N2) immunogenicity. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total
HA head binding antibodies to cell- A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year
2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-
ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with
either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating
viruses with decreased neutralizing antibody egg/cell ratio. RIV4 also had
higher post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in
year 1, but there was no signiﬁcant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise
among vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2. Multiple seasons of non-egg-
based vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from
immune memory to egg-adapted epitopes and re-focus the immune responses
towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness.

Inﬂuenza viruses are a common cause of respiratory infections in
humans, annual inﬂuenza vaccination has been recommended in the
United States (US) for many decades. Conventionally, inﬂuenza vac-
cine seed viruses are propagated in embryonated chicken eggs to
produce
inactivated
inﬂuenza
vaccines
(IIV).
However,

manufacturing process can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the
hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered anti-
genicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the circulating
inﬂuenza strains1–6. Therefore, vaccine manufacturing platforms that
do not rely on eggs have been established in the past decade including



==================== PAGE 2 ====================

a cell culture-based inﬂuenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent™by
Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant inﬂuenza vaccine (Flublok
Quadrivalent® by SanoﬁPasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the
antigen dose at 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to the standard dose
IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain). Both ccIIV4 and RIV4 are cur-
rently licensed in the US7. Clinical trials evaluating ccIIV and RIV have
shown comparable to advantageous immunogenicity compared to
standard-dose egg-based IIVs in different age groups8–13. Observational
studies and clinical trials reported that ccIIV and RIV demonstrated
modest to signiﬁcant improvement of VE over egg-based IIV in dif-
ferent age groups and inﬂuenza seasons7,14–16.
Repeat annual inﬂuenza vaccination is another factor that may
affect the antibody responses elicited by inﬂuenza vaccines. Studies
indicated that frequent prior vaccination could blunt the antibody
responses to inﬂuenza vaccination over time11,13,17–21 which can lead to
reduced vaccine effectiveness22–26. One study reported that repeat
vaccination reduced antibody afﬁnity maturation to the HA antigens of
all vaccine components from egg-based, cell-culture based, and
recombinant inﬂuenza vaccines20. Thus far, there are few direct com-
parisons of immunogenicity of the three vaccine platforms in popu-
lations with a history of frequent inﬂuenza vaccinations. We recently
reported the comparison of immunogenicity of ccIIV and RIV to egg-
based standard dose IIVs among US healthcare personnel (HCP) aged
18−64 years from a randomized, open-label trial during the 2018−2019
season27 and the 2019−2020 season following repeat vaccination in 2
consecutive years28,29. Those comparisons were focused on the neu-
tralizing antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses only.
RIV4 elicited higher neutralizing antibody responses than IIV4 against
cell-propagated vaccine viruses27. Repeat vaccination with ccIIV4 or
RIV4 in 2 seasons also resulted in signiﬁcantly higher post-vaccination
antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses29. Most HCP
participants had received egg-based inﬂuenza vaccines frequently
during the preceding ﬁve seasons.

We previously reported that antibodies targeting the egg-adapted
epitopes could be preferentially boosted from repeat vaccination with
egg-based vaccines3. The potential of non-egg-based vaccines to miti-
gate the impact of prior egg-based vaccination remains unclear. In this
study, we analyzed neutralizing antibody responses to both egg- and
cell-propagated vaccine viruses, and total binding antibodies to both
HA head and HA stalk among HCP following vaccination with RIV, ccIIV,
and standard egg-based IIVs in two inﬂuenza seasons to investigate
whether repeat vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines can overcome
the effect of prior repeat vaccination with egg-based vaccines.


RESULTS

2018−2019 and 2019−2020 study seasons
This study was a randomized, open-label trial conducted in the Uni-
ted States during the Northern Hemisphere 2018−2019 (Year 1,
n = 723) and 2019−2020 (Year 2, n = 684) inﬂuenza seasons (Fig. 1). In
year 1, HCP were randomized to receive one of four inﬂuenza vac-
cines: ccIIV4 (Flucelvax), RIV4 (Flublok), Fluzone IIV4 or Fluarix IIV4.
Year 1 vaccines contain 2018−2019 Northern Hemisphere formula-
tion including an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/
Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2)-like virus; a B/Colorado/06/
2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage); and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-
like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage) (Table 1). ccIIV4 in the
2018−2019 season contained cell-culture derived seed strains for the
inﬂuenza A(H3N2) and B vaccine strains but egg-based seed strain for
A(H1N1)pdm09. In year 2 (2019−2020 season), HCP were re-
randomized into 7 repeat vaccination arms: IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4,
IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4
(Fig. 1). The A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) components were upda-
ted to a A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus and an A/Kan-
sas/14/2017 (H3N2)-like virus respectively while the B/Victoria and B/
Yamagata components remained the same (Table 1).

EGG-ADAPTED AMINO ACID SUBSTITUTIONS IN EGG-BASED VACCINES IN
BOTH STUDY YEARS

HA sequences from components of IIV4, ccIV4 and RIV4 vaccines
used in both study years were ﬁrst analyzed (Table 1). Within the
same season, the study vaccines contained different candidate vac-
cine viruses (CVVs) that are antigenically-like the prototype vaccine
viruses recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)30.
Compared to the cell-grown vaccine prototype viruses, the vaccine
antigens from all 4 subtypes in the egg-based vaccines had HA sub-
stitutions due to egg-adaptation. A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV for-
mulated in Fluzone IIV4 had Q223R substitution in both years, while
the egg CVV used for Fluarix IIV4 and ccIIV4 in year 1 had G225A
substitution instead (Table 1). For A(H3N2), year 1 egg-based vaccine
had T160K (resulting in a loss of glycosylation motif at HA 158),
L194P, and D225G egg-adapted changes, while year 2 egg-based
vaccine had D190N and N246T substitutions. Inﬂuenza B vaccine
viruses remained the same in both years. Egg-based B/Victoria vac-
cine had T199I substitution, which can cause a loss of glycosylation
motif at HA position 197; whereas egg-based B/Yamagata vaccine had

a N197D substitution that can also cause a loss of glycosylation motif
at HA position 197.


ANTIBODY RESPONSES AT PRE-VACCINATION, 1-MONTH AND 6-MONTHS
POST-VACCINATION IN YEAR 1

We ﬁrst measured neutralizing antibody responses by micro-
neutralization assays (MN) for A(H3N2) and hemagglutination
inhibition assays (HI) for A(H1N1)dpm09 and Bs. In year 1 at base-
line, pre-vaccination MN/HI geometric mean titers (GMTs) were
similar (p > 0.05) among the 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 2). Signiﬁcant
differences in neutralizing antibody responses were detected at
1-month post-vaccination. For A(H3N2), RIV4 vaccination induced
signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) neutralizing antibody responses to
the cell-propagated A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4s (Fluarix and
Fluzone) in both age groups; RIV4 group also mounted signiﬁcantly
higher (p < 0.05) MN antibody responses to the egg-propagated
A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and Fluarix-IIV4. For A(H1N1)pdm09,
RIV4 induced signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) post-vaccination HI
antibody responses to both egg- (GMT 122) and cell- (GMT 137)

propagated A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses than ccIIV4 (egg virus GMT 76;
cell virus GMT 77) in the 18-44 years age group, and signiﬁcantly
higher (p < 0.05) post-vaccination HI antibodies to egg- (GMT 82)
and cell- (GMT 76) propagated A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses than
Fluzone-IIV4 (egg virus GMT 43; cell virus GMT 36) in the 45-64
years age group. In contrast, post-vaccination HI antibodies to B/
Victoria and B/Yamagata viruses were mostly similar (p > 0.05)
among the 4 vaccines in both age groups, except that RIV4 induced
signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) HI antibody responses (GMT: 117) to
cell-propagated B/Yamagata vaccine virus than ccIIV4 (GMT: 80) in
the 18−44 years age group (Fig. 2). RIV4 also had higher ser-
opositivity rate (proportions of titers ≥40) and seroconversion rate
(SCR) than egg-based IIV4 vaccines against the cell-grown A(H3N2)
virus (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2)27.
When comparing post-vaccination antibody responses by fold
rise, RIV4 induced overall higher geometric mean fold rise of neu-
tralizing antibody titers to the vaccine viruses (Fig. 3A, B). For A(H3N2),
RIV4 induced higher fold rise of neutralizing antibodies to both cell-
and egg-propagated A(H3N2) viruses compared to other vaccines in
both age groups (Fig. 3A, B). MN fold rise to A(H3N2) cell vaccine virus
was signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.0001) in RIV4 groups (3.5 in 18−44 years,
4.6 in 45−64 years) than those in IIV4 and ccIIV4 groups (range:
1.0−1.6). Neutralizing antibody responses waned at 6-months post-
vaccination in year 1. GMTs to each virus at 6-months reduced by 1−2.5
folds comparing with the GMTs at 1-month post-vaccination (Fig. 3C,
D).

virus, while hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were measured for A(H1N1)
pdm09, B/Victoria (B/VIC), and B/Yamagata (B/YAM) viruses. One-way ANOVA
corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s test) was used to compare the GMTs
of each time point among the 4 vaccine groups. Statistically signiﬁcant differences
between groups are indicated by p values on the horizontal bars.

neutralizing antibodies (6 month/1 month) was greater in RIV4 reci-
pients to cell-A(H3N2) in both age groups, and to cell-A(H1N1)pdm09
virus in the 45−64 years group (Fig. 3C, D), the titers of neutralizing
antibodies to cell-grown viruses in RIV4 recipients still remained at
similar or higher levels compared to other vaccine groups (Fig. 2).
To further elucidate the quality of the antibody responses, we
then analyzed the total binding antibodies by the enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to both HA head of the 4 antigen sub-
types and HA stalk of the A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 subtypes in the
quadrivalent vaccines. Total binding antibodies include both neu-
tralizing and non-neutralizing antibody responses. For A(H3N2), con-
sistent with MN responses, RIV4 induced signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.01)
total binding antibodies (Fig. 4A) and signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.001)
fold rise (Fig. S1A) to the cell-A(H3N2) HA head at 1-month post-vac-
cination compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4. For A(H1N1)pdm09, all 4 vac-
cines induced similar fold rise (1 month/day 0) in the total binding
antibodies to egg- and cell- A(H1N1)pdm09 HA (Fig. S1A), although
RIV4 group had the highest total binding antibodies to the cell-A(H1N1)
pdm09 HA at 1-month post-vaccination, it is likely due to the higher
levels of pre-vaccination total binding antibodies (Fig. 4A). For inﬂu-
enza Bs, RIV4 induced signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.01) fold-rise against B/
VIC and B/YAM cell virus HA head than Fluarix IIV4 but not Fluzone IIV4
(Fig. S1A). At 6-months post-vaccination, total binding antibodies to
the HA headwaned but the levels of totalbinding antibodies to the cell-
grown virus HA head of all 4 subtypes in the RIV4 group remained the
highest among the 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 4A).

Fig. 3 | Fold rise of MN or HI antibody titers at 1-month post-vaccination and
waning of antibody titers at 6-months post-vaccination in Year 1. Geometric
mean (GM) fold rise of antibody titers (1 m/Day 0) from each of the four vaccine
groups were calculated for egg- and cell-propagated vaccine viruses, and for 18−44
years (Fluzone IIV4 (n = 52), Fluarix IIV4 (n = 55), ccIIV4 (n = 133), RIV4 (n = 98)) and
45−64 years (Fluzone IIV4 (n = 58), Fluarix IIV4 (n = 63), ccIIV4 (n = 147), RIV4
(n = 98)) age groups respectively (A, B). Antibody waning was expressed as the GM
fold-reduction of titers from 1-month to 6-months (1 m/6 m) post-vaccination for

Pre-existing A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk antibodies
were detected in participants at varies levels. Comparing HA stalk
antibody titers at 1-month post-vaccination versus day 0, vaccination
signiﬁcantly boosted A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk antibodies in all 4 vac-
cine groups (p < 0.01), and signiﬁcantly boosted A(H3N2) HA stalk
antibodies in 3 of the 4 vaccine groups (p < 0.001, Fluzone IIV4, ccIIV4,
and RIV4) (Fig. 4C). The RIV4 group had the highest A(H1N1)pdm09 HA
stalk and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies at 1-month post-vaccination,
however the fold rises of HA stalk antibodies were low (<1.8) and
similar among all 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 4D). At 6-months post-vacci-
nation, waning of HA stalk antibodies were more notable in ccIIV4 and
RIV4 groups compared to IIV4 (Fig. S2).

Active surveillance was conducted during the inﬂuenza season in
year 1, a total of 26 breakthrough infection cases were identiﬁed with
an attack rate of 3.6% (26/723) (Supplementary Table S3).


ANTIBODY RESPONSES TO EGG-ADAPTED EPITOPES MEASURED BY
ANTIBODY GMT EGG/CELL TITER RATIO IN YEAR 1

To assess the levels of antibody responses targeting the egg-adapted
epitopes, we used the antibody “GMT egg/cell titer ratio” as a proxy to
quantify the extent of difference in antibody responses to egg- versus
cell-viruses in each vaccine group (Fig. 5A, B). The post-vaccination
neutralizing antibody GMT egg/cell titer ratio was the most pro-
nounced for A(H3N2), with elevated MN GMT egg/cell titer ratios in all
vaccine groups (Fig. 5A, B), suggesting vaccination induced signiﬁcant
levels of neutralizing antibody responses targeting A(H3N2) egg-
adapted epitopes related to 158 (CHO-), 194 P, and 225 G (Table 1). The
post-vaccination A(H3N2) neutralizing antibody GMT egg/cell ratio
from the 18−44 years group who received Fluzone IIV4 (3.7), Fluarix
IIV4 (3.8), and ccIIV4 (3.0) were signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) than
those in the same age groups who received RIV4 (2.1) (Fig. 5A). Similar
trend was also observed in the 45−64 years group, the post-vaccination
A(H3N2) neutralizing antibody GMT egg/cell titer ratios in those who
received Fluzone IIV4 (4.0), Fluarix IIV4 (3.5), and ccIIV4 (2.6) were
signiﬁcantly
higher
(p < 0.01)
than
those
who
received
RIV4
(1.7) (Fig. 5B).

In contrast, the impact of egg-adaption is less profound in HI
antibody responses to A(H1N1)pdm09 and both B lineage viruses. For

18−44 years (Fluzone IIV4 (n = 47), Fluarix IIV4 (n = 48), ccIIV4 (n = 124), RIV4
(n = 85)) and 45−64 years (Fluzone IIV4 (n = 54), Fluarix IIV4 (n = 59), ccIIV4
(n = 142), RIV4 (n = 92)) respectively (C, D). MN titers were measured for A(H3N2)
virus, while HI titers were measured for A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, and B/YAM viruses.
One-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s test) was used to
compare the GM fold-rise or fold-reduction of each time point among the 4 vaccine
groups. Statistically signiﬁcant differences between groups are indicated by p
values on the horizontal bars.

A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Yamagata, the post-vaccination HI antibody
GMT egg/cell titer ratios were all <2 and similar (p > 0.05) among the
vaccine groups (Fig. 5A, B). For B/Victoria, the post-vaccination HI GMT
egg/cell titer ratios were slightly elevated (range: 2−3) with the ratio in
Fluzone IIV4 recipients signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in
RIV4 recipients from the 45−64 years group (Fig. 5B).

Next, to assess whether vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines
can overcome the impact of egg-adaptation and reduce the GMT egg/
cell ratio in the vaccine responses, we calculated the “proportion of the
participants with egg/cell ratio ≥4” in MN/HI titers at pre- and 1-month
post-vaccination (Fig. 5C, D). At pre-vaccination, there was no sig-
niﬁcant difference in the proportion of participants with GMT egg/cell
ratio ≥4 among the 4 vaccine groups. At baseline, around 40% of
participants had GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 to A(H3N2) and B/Victoria
viruses, suggesting a high prevalence of pre-existing neutralizing
antibodies targeting HA egg-adapted epitopes in this highly vaccinated
HCP population. After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg-
based
vaccines
generally
reinforced
the
neutralizing
antibody
responses to egg-adapted epitopes as evidenced by an increased trend
in the proportion of participants with GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4. In
contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of parti-
cipants with GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4 was overall lower at 1-month
post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination (Fig. 5C, D), demon-
strating the potential of non-egg-based vaccines to reduce the neu-
tralizing antibody response difference to egg versus cell viruses. Most
notably, only in the RIV4 groups to A(H3N2) virus, the proportions of
GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4-fold were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01) decreased
in both age groups (from 58% down to 26% in 18−44 years, and from
40% down to 21% in 45−64 years), suggesting RIV4 vaccination can
potentially mitigate the pre-existing antibody memory to egg-adapted
epitopes by improving the magnitude of neutralizing antibody
responses to cell-propagated viruses (Fig. 5C, D).

We then also analyzed the HA binding antibody “GMT egg/cell titer
ratio” measured by ELISA. Similar trend was observed as with MN/HI
antibodies that GMT egg/cell ratios were higher (p < 0.05) in the egg-
based IIV4 groups than those in the ccIIV4 and RIV4 groups for A(H3N2)
HA head and B/VIC HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4B). However, the
GMT egg/cell HA binding antibody ratios (Fig. 4B) were around 1 for all

responses do not target the egg-adapted epitopes on HA.


REDIRECTING NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY RESPONSES FROM EGG-ADAPTED
EPITOPES FOLLOWING REPEAT VACCINATION WITH NON-EGG VS EGG-
BASED VACCINES IN YEAR 2

y
In year 2, participants who received ccIIV4, RIV4, and Fluzone IIV4 or
Fluarix IIV4 in year 1 were re-randomized into seven repeat-vaccination
arms: ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4,
IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) (Fig. 1).
We compared the post-vaccination HI GMTs to the cell-vaccine
viruses between IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) and each of the 6 repeat vaccina-

age group (18−44 years) in the ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, and
IIV4-RIV4 arms, and the older age group (45−64 years) in ccIIV4-RIV4
and RIV4-RIV4 arms, all mounted signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) neu-
tralizing antibody titers to cell-A(H3N2) virus than those in the IIV4-IIV4
(Fluzone) arm. For HI antibody response to A(H1N1)pdm09 cell virus,
RIV4-RIV4 and IIV4-RIV4 arms in 18−44 years, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4,
RIV4-RIV4 arms in 45−64 years all had signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) HI
antibody responses than those in the IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm. Vacci-
nees in the 18−44 years group in the ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-RIV4, and IIV4-

corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s test) was used to compare the GMTs
of each time point among the 4 vaccine groups (A, C). One-way ANOVA nonpara-
metric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the fold changes among the 4
vaccine groups (B, D). Statistically signiﬁcant differences between groups are
indicated by p values on the horizontal bars.*: In (C), paired t test (two-tailed) was
used for comparing the pre- and 1 m post-vaccination stalk antibody titers within
the same vaccine group: signiﬁcantly higher HA stalk antibody titers were detected
in 1 m post-vaccination than pre-vaccination for H3 stalk binding antibody in Flu-
zone IIV4 (p = 0.0009), ccIIV4 (p = 0.0004), RIV4 (p < 0.0001); and for H1 stalk
binding antibody in Fluzone IIV4 (p = 0.0005), Fluarix IIV4 (p = 0.0092), ccIIV4
(p < 0.0001), RIV4 (p = 0.0015).

RIV4 arms had signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) HI antibody responses to
both B/VIC and B/YAM cell viruses versus those in the IIV4-IIV4 (Flu-
zone) arm. Participants in the older age group (45−64 years) who
received non-egg-based vaccine in year 2, most had signiﬁcantly higher
(p < 0.05) HI GMTs to both B/VIC and B/YAM cell virus compared to
those in the IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm, except ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and IIV4-
ccIIV4 arms for B/YAM cell virus (Fig. 6). It is worth noting that those
who received IIV4 in Year 1 then RIV4 in Year 2 demonstrated improved
antibody responses to cell-grown vaccine viruses compared to those
who received IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone). The seropositivity rates (Supple-
mentary Table S4) and seroconversion rates (Table S5) to both egg-
and cell- viruses in year 2 are summarized in the supplementary
materials28,29. Overall, in year 2 participants who received one or two
non-egg-based vaccines mounted higher post-vaccination HI antibody
responses to cell-grown vaccine viruses than those who received
repeated egg-based IIV4 vaccination in both years (IIV4-IIV4).
At 1-month post-vaccination during Year 1, 21−40% of HCP who
received only one season of non-egg-based vaccine including RIV4 still
had A(H3N2) GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4 (Fig. 5C, D). We therefore
investigated whether repeat vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines
in year 2 could further reduce the HI GMT egg/cell titer ratio (Fig. 7).
Among recipients of IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone), the proportion of participants
with HI GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4 generally increased, especially for

virus in the 45−64 years group, suggesting repeated boost to anti-
bodies targeting egg-adapted epitopes in these participants after
receiving consecutive egg-based IIV4 vaccination. In contrast, among
recipients of non-egg-based vaccines in just one study year (IIV4-ccIIV4
or IIV4-RIV4) or in both study years (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-
ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4), the proportions of participants with egg/cell ratio
≥4 to generally decreased post-vaccination though did not reach sta-
tistical signiﬁcance in some repeat vaccination groups (Fig. 7). Among
those, the ccIIV4-RIV4 arm had signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) reduction in the
proportion of HI GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 against A(H3N2) viruses com-
paring pre- vs post-vaccination in the 45−64 years group, and the RIV4-
ccIIV4 arm had signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) reduction in the proportion of HI
GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the younger age
group in year 2, suggesting multiple seasons of repeat vaccination with
non-egg-based vaccines may be needed to overcome the dominant
antibody responses to the egg-adapted epitopes and redirect the
antibody responses away from the egg-adapted epitopes.
Total binding antibodies to HA head and HA stalk in year 2 were
also analyzed (Fig. 8). At 1-month post-vaccination, the levels of total
HA binding antibodies were similar in most repeat vaccination arms,
except ccIIV4-RIV4 arm induced signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) HA head
binding antibodies to A(H3N2), both ccIIV4-RIV4 and IIV4-RIV4 arms
induced signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) HA head binding to B/Vic and B/
Yam than the IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm (Fig. 8A). The total HA binding
antibody GMT egg/cell ratio was around 1 against all 4 vaccine com-
ponents with no signiﬁcant difference between 7 repeat vaccination
arms (Fig. 8B), indicating most of the total HA binding antibodies are
not targeting the egg-adapted epitopes.

cell vaccine virus (egg/cell titer ratio) at pre- and 1-month post-vaccination were
presented for each vaccine component among the 4 vaccine groups for 18−44
years (C) and 45−64 years (D). Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed) was performed for
comparing proportions of ≥4 -fold reduced titer to cell vaccine virus between pre-
and 1-month post-vaccination in each vaccine group. MN titers were measured for
A(H3N2) virus, while HI titers were measured for A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, and B/
YAM viruses. Statistically signiﬁcant differences between groups are indicated by p
values on the horizontal bars (A, B). P values on the trend lines of RIV4 group
indicate signiﬁcantly reduced proportions from pre- to 1-month post-vaccina-
tion (C, D).

Comparing pre- and 1-month post-vaccination, A(H3N2) HA stalk
binding antibodies were signiﬁcantly boosted in ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-RIV4,
IIV4-ccIIV4, and IIV4-RIV4 arms, while A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk binding
antibodies were also signiﬁcantly boosted in ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and RIV4-ccIIV4
arms (Fig. 8C). However, fold rise in both A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk and
A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies were low (GM fold rise <1.78) with no sig-
niﬁcant difference (p > 0.05) among all 7 repeat vaccination arms (Fig. 8D).


DISCUSSION

In this study, we compared the antibody responses to egg- versus cell-
propagated vaccine viruses following vaccination with RIV4, ccIIV4 or
IIV4 among HCP aged 18−44 and 45−64 years. RIV4 induced more
robust HI and MN antibody responses than ccIIV4 and egg-based IIV4
against multiple vaccine strains including cell-propagated A(H3N2),
consistent with previous reports9,13,15,27–29. Our analysis also indicates
that repeat vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines could overcome
pre-existing egg/cell titer differences in neutralizing antibody levels by
re-directing vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses away
from egg-adapted epitopes, resulting in higher antibody responses to
circulating cell-grown viruses, even with frequent prior vaccination
with egg-based inﬂuenza vaccines in HCP.
Reported VE against A(H3N2) virus was low during the 2016−17 to
2018−19 seasons despite the absence of apparent antigenic drift of the
circulating viruses1,4,31. The egg-adapted changes on the HA head
domain in the egg-grown A(H3N2) vaccine virus: T160K, L194P, and
D225G resulted in an “antigenic mismatch” from circulating strains that
likely contributed to the low observed VE3,5,6. Our study showed that
even at pre-vaccination, a high proportion of HCP in this study had MN
GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 to A(H3N2) virus, suggesting the high prevalence

vaccination arms. HI antibody titers from each of the 7 repeat vaccine arms were

respectively for 18−44 years and 45−64 years age groups. Gray dots represented

of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies targeting 158 (loss of glycosy-
lation caused by T160K) 194P, and 225G epitopes, likely due to the prior
repeat vaccination with egg-based vaccines. More than 68% of the HCP
in this study received inﬂuenza egg-based vaccine in all ﬁve preceding
inﬂuenza seasons (Table 2). The imprinting effect of egg-based vac-
cines could be lifelong resulting in a persistence of antibodies targeting
egg-adapted sites that could be preferentially reinforced following
repeat egg-based vaccination3. This may impede the quality of anti-
body response to the circulating inﬂuenza strains and negatively affect
VE. Our study suggests that non-egg-based vaccines, especially RIV4,
might circumvent the effect of repeat vaccination with egg-based
inﬂuenza vaccines that contain egg-adapted changes.
Repeat vaccination can lead to reduced VE23,32,33. In year 1, the
frequent prior repeat egg-based vaccinations may blunt the antibody
responses to the subsequent vaccination as reﬂected by the limited
fold rise in MN/HI antibody titers (Fig. 3). Khurana et al. also observed
signiﬁcantly lower fold rise to A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and inﬂuenza B viru-
ses in those with prior vaccination irrespective of vaccine platforms
received20. In a highly vaccinated population such as HCP, an effective
vaccine should be able to overcome issues with both repeat vaccina-
tion and vaccine egg-adapted mutations. RIV4 vaccination reduced the
proportions of participants with MN GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 against
A(H3N2) by two-fold in both age groups (Fig. 5C, D). In year 2, all 4
repeat vaccination arms with non-egg-based vaccines (ccIIV-ccIIV4,
ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4) further reduced the proportion of
participants with HI GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 against A(H3N2) to less than
10% (Fig. 7), of which 3 in 18−44 years group (ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4,
RIV4-RIV4) and 2 in 45−64 years group (ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-RIV4)

(n = 47). 45−64 years: ccIIV4-ccIIV4 (n = 59), ccIIV4-RIV4 (n = 61), RIV4-ccIIV4
(n = 45), RIV4-RIV4 (n = 44), IIV4-ccIIV4 (n = 57), IIV4-RIV4 (n = 56), IIV4-IIV4 (n = 56).
Unpaired t test (two-tailed) was used to compare the post-vaccination GMTs to cell
vaccine viruses between IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm and each of the remaining 6 vac-
cine arms within the same age group. Statistically signiﬁcant differences between
groups are indicated by p values on the horizontal bars.

induced signiﬁcantly higher HI antibodies to A(H3N2) cell virus than
IIV4-IIV4 arm (Fig. 6). Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that multiple
seasons of vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines may be needed to
overcome the pre-existing immune memory to egg-adapted epitopes
and re-direct the neutralizing antibody responses towards epitopes on
cell-grown viruses that better represent circulating strains.

Furthermore, the difference in antigenicity and egg-adaption
between vaccine viruses from consecutive inﬂuenza seasons could
further confound the effect of repeat vaccination. The A(H3N2) vaccine
virus in year 2 was updated to a 3 C.3a A/Kansas/14/2017-like virus,
which is genetically and antigenically distant from the 3 C.2a vaccine
virus A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 in year 1. Year 2 vaccine virus
A/Kansas/14/2017 virus bears different egg-adapted changes at D190N
and N246T but possess 194 L and 225D that are the same as cell-
propagated A(H3N2) vaccine virus in Year 1 (Table 1). This could have
also contributed to the improved antibody response to the cell-grown
A(H3N2) vaccine virus after the repeat vaccination in year 2. Thus far,
most reported VE from repeated vaccination studies were from egg-
based vaccines, evaluation of whether repeat vaccination with non-egg-
based vaccines will improve VE, especially for A(H3N2), is warranted.
To fully characterize the quantity as well as the quality of the
antibody responses, we measured both functional, neutralizing anti-
body responses to egg- versus cell- propagated viruses (by MN or HI),
and the total HA binding antibodies (by ELISA) that include both
neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody responses. For RIV4, both
increased antigen dose and the absence of egg-adapted mutations may
have led to the improved immunogenicity13. RIV4 contains 3 times the
antigen dose at 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to the standard dose

IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain). For A(H3N2), RIV4 vaccination
not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody
responses (Fig. 2) by reducing the MN GMT egg/cell ratios in both
years, it also signiﬁcantly increased the quantity of the total A(H3N2)
cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4A, Fig. S1A). However, for
A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses, the difference in HI antibody versus the
total HA head binding antibody levels among 4 vaccine groups was less
consistent, suggesting that the magnitude of improvement differ
between subtypes and were likely determined by the relative immu-
nodominance of the egg-adapted HA epitopes for each subtype. In
addition, the egg/cell HA head binding ELISA titer ratios were around 1
for all vaccine antigen subtypes irrespective of vaccine platforms
(Fig. 4B), suggesting the total HA binding antibody responses induced
by vaccination cannot differentiate egg-adapted epitopes on HA even
for A(H3N2). This is in stark contrast to the highly elevated egg/cell
GMT ratio in neutralizing antibody responses to egg- vs cell-A(H3N2)
viruses (Fig. 5A, B), highlighting the importance of inducing high
quality, neutralizing antibody responses from vaccination.
Our study also demonstrated that the impact of vaccine egg-
adaption may differ between inﬂuenza virus subtypes, with the biggest
impact on neutralizing antibodies to A(H3N2) and moderate impact for
inﬂuenza B vaccine viruses. HA changes due to egg-adaptation resulted
in a loss of glycosylation at HA position 197 for both B/Victoria and B/
Yamagata egg vaccine viruses (Table 1), which could alter the anti-
genicity of inﬂuenza B virus, particularly for B/Victoria lineage34–36.
Disproportional impact of the egg-adapted mutation at HA position 197
on the two B lineages were also observed in this study. B/Victoria virus
had a much higher GMT egg/cell titer ratio and proportion of partici-
pants with GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 than B/Yamagata virus in year 1 (Fig. 5).
Similar to what was observed for A(H3N2), in Year 2, repeat vaccination
with IIV4 boosted the antibody responses to egg-adapted epitopes at
HA 197 in B/Victoria vaccine virus, resulting in substantially increased
proportions of GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 only in the IIV4-IIV4 arm (Fig. 7).

years age group. Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed) was performed for comparing
proportions of ≥4 -fold reduced titer to cell vaccine virus between pre- and
1-month post-vaccination in each vaccine group. P values noted on the corre-
sponding trend lines indicate statistically signiﬁcant difference of the proportions
between pre- and post-vaccination.

The impact of egg-adaptation was the least profound on the
antibody response to A(H1N1)pdm09. Both Year 1 and Year 2 A(H1N1)
pdm09 vaccine viruses bear egg-adapted change at HA Q223R. Studies
have reported that Q223R egg-adapted change at the HA head domain
of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter
antigenicity and inﬂuence immune response37–42. In this study, 1-month
post-vaccination GMTs to both egg- and cell-propagated A(H1N1)
pdm09 vaccine viruses in year 1 were similar among the 4 vaccine
groups, with GMT egg/cell titer ratio around 1.0, and the proportion of
HCP with egg/cell titer ratio ≥4 was only 2−11% (Fig. 5), indicating a less
immunodominant role of Q223R change. Furthermore, the two egg
IIV4 vaccines induced similar antibody responses to A(H1N1)pdm09
viruses regardless of the variation at 223. These ﬁndings are consistent
with our previous report in which we found that among over 300
adults who received egg-based A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines with Q223R
egg-adapted epitope during 5 inﬂuenza seasons, only 9% of partici-
pants mounted antibodies speciﬁc to 223R38.
Multiple immune mechanisms can contribute to the protection
from inﬂuenza infection. Broadly cross-reactive HA stalk antibodies
have been considered as one of the targets for universal vaccine
development. Here, we assessed both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2)
HA stalk antibody responses in all vaccine groups in both years. When
comparing the post-vs pre-vaccination HA stalk antibody levels,
vaccination induced HA stalk antibody rise in several vaccine groups
and repeat vaccination arms. However, the levels of geometric mean
titer fold rise were low (close to 1, Figs. 4D, 8D) with no signiﬁcant
difference in fold rise among different vaccine groups in both years,
even in RIV4 group that received 3 times more antigen doses; the
difference in HA stalk antibody titers post-vaccination mostly mir-
rored the difference in pre-existing HA stalk antibody levels. To this
end, development of next generations vaccines that can induce
multiple arms of immune responses could improve the effectiveness
of the vaccines.

Human immunity to inﬂuenza is quite complex and present chal-
lenges to improve vaccine effectiveness. Immune priming can play dual
roles and is largely directed by the immunodominance of imprinted HA
epitopes upon ﬁrst exposure to inﬂuenza antigen, as well as the repe-
ated inﬂuenza exposures by vaccinations or infections later in
lifetime3,38. Here, our study demonstrated how immunodominant egg-
adapted epitopes on A(H3N2) HA can impact the immunogenicity from
repeated vaccination. Collectively with previous reports3, ﬁndings from
this study could provide a few meaningful insights to improve vacci-
nation strategy. First, for those who were repeat vaccinated with egg-
based vaccines such as HCP and older adults, vaccination with non-egg-
based vaccines could be especially beneﬁcial; second, it would also be
important not to prime naive children with egg-adapted epitopes3, it
might be necessary to immunize naive children with non-egg-based
inﬂuenza vaccines as their ﬁrst priming dose. In addition, improved
vaccine formulations, such as higher vaccine doses and the use of
adjuvants, could also improve vaccine immunogenicity.
Our study has several limitations. First, we only compared the
immunogenicity of egg- vs non-egg-based vaccines in two inﬂuenza
seasons. The effect of the vaccine egg-adapted changes on vaccine
immunogenicity will vary by season depending on the antigenic
properties of the vaccine viruses. A(H3N2) vaccine was updated to a

within the same age group (A). One-way ANOVA corrected for multiple compar-
sons (Tukey’s test) was used to compare the GMTs of stalk binding antibody at
each time point among the 4 vaccine groups (C). One-way ANOVA nonparametri
Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the fold changes among the 4 vaccine
groups (B, D).Statistically signiﬁcant differences between groups are indicated by p
values on the horizontal bars (A, C). *In (C), paired t test (two-tailed) was used fo
comparing the pre- and 1 m post-vaccination stalk antibody titers within the sam
vaccine group: signiﬁcantly higher HA stalk antibody titers were detected in 1 m
post-vaccination than pre-vaccination for H3 stalk antibody titers in ccIIV4-RIV4
p = 0.0001), RIV4-RIV4 (p = 0.004), IIV4-ccIIV4 (p = 0.03), IIV4-RIV4 (p = 0.03); and
or H1 stalk antibodies in ccIIV4-ccIIV4 (p = 0.008), RIV4-ccIIV4 (p = 0.006).

3 C.2a virus in 2021−2022 inﬂuenza season with the same T160K egg-
adapted change in the egg-based vaccines and was updated again in
2022−23 and 2023−24 seasons with the egg-based vaccines carrying a
different set of egg-adapted mutations30, thus, continued effort is
needed to assess vaccine immunogenicity and VE. Second, we only
focused on the antibody responses to HA. RIV4 lacks the neur-
aminidase (NA) component that also could contribute to the protec-
tive efﬁcacy of inﬂuenza vaccines. Thus, whether the improved
antibody responses to HA alone in RIV4 will translate into improved
vaccine efﬁcacy and effectiveness still needs to be assessed. Other
humoral immune responses, such as antibody responses to NA,
mucosal and cell-mediated immunity, also contribute to protection.
Lastly, no correction for multiple comparisons was done because this
was an exploratory analysis.

Taken together, our study demonstrated that multiple seasons of
vaccination with non-egg-based inﬂuenza vaccines can improve HA-
mediated antibody immunogenicity to cell-propagated viruses repre-
senting circulating strains. Our ﬁndings support the use of antibody
responses to cell-propagated viruses, rather than to egg-propagated
vaccine viruses, as the primary endpoint in future immunogenicity
studies for licensure or comparison of inﬂuenza vaccines. Inﬂuenza
product and platform speciﬁc VE estimates could help conﬁrm

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STUDY DESIGN

y
g
The original study was a randomized, open-label trial conducted in the
United States during the Northern Hemisphere 2018−2019 (Year 1) and
2019−2020 (Year 2) inﬂuenza seasons. This study is an exploratory
analysis. The detailed participant enrollment, randomization, and
blinding were previously described27–29. Participant characterisitcs in
year 1 are described in Table 2. During Year 1, HCP were stratiﬁed by two
age groups (18−44 years and 45−64 years) and randomized at 4:4:2:2
ratio to receive one of four quadrivalent vaccines: ccIIV4 (Flucelvax),
RIV4 (Flublok), Fluzone IIV4 or Fluarix IIV4 (Fig. 1). Serum samples were
collected at baseline (day 0 pre-vaccination), 1-month, and 6-months
post-vaccination. The Year 2 study was designed to evaluate the anti-
body responses following 7 different Year 1-Year 2 repeat vaccination
regimens: IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone), IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-
RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4 (Fig. 1). Serum samples were col-
lected at baseline (day 0) and 1-month post-vaccination.
Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4, the two egg-based vaccines were
analyzed separately for this exploratory analysis because the two
vaccines have different egg-adaptated mutation on the HA of the
A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV (Table 1). Fluzone has Q223R substitution
which was associated with focused antibody response to 223R in some
vaccinees as we previously reported38, while the A(H1N1)pdm09 egg
CVV in Fluarix had 223Q. In addition, the current analysis is also age-
stratiﬁed by 18−44 years and 45−64 years age groups as we previously
observed that the impact of vaccine egg-adaptation on antibody
response to A(H3N2) virus may be age-related3.


HEMAGGLUTINATION INHIBITION (HI) AND MICRONEUTRALIZATION
(MN) ASSAYS

Antibody responses to A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata
lineage viruses were analyzed using HI assays using methods as pre-
viously described43. HIs for A(H1N1)pdm09 and inﬂuenza B viruses
were performed using 0.5% turkey erythrocytes. Egg-grown viruses

were propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Cell-grown
A(H1N1)pdm09 and inﬂuenza B viruses were propagated in Madin-
Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Inﬂuenza B antigens were ether-
treated prior to use in the HI assays. Egg- and cell (MDCK)-propagated

and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) viruses were tested in year 1,
Egg-propagated A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09, cell-propagated
A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1N1)pdm09, egg- and cell-propagated B/Colorado/
06/2017 (B/Victoria) and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) viruses
were tested in year 2 by HI using 0.5% turkey erythrocytes.
Antibody responses to A(H3N2) viruses were analyzed by MN
assays in year 1 (the cell-grown vaccine antigen of the study year does
not hemagglutinate in the HI assays), and HI assays in year 2. Egg-grown
A(H3N2) viruses were propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken
eggs, cell-grown A(H3N2) viruses were propagated in stably transfected
MDCK cells with cDNA of human
2,6-sialyltransferase
(MDCK-
SIAT1 cells). Egg- and cell (MDCK-SIAT1)-grown A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-
0019/2016 viruses were tested in MN assays in year 1 using MDCK-SIAT1
cells using methods as previously described44. In Year 2, egg- and cell-
propagated A/Kansas/14/2017 viruses were tested by HI assays using
0.75% guinea pig erythrocytes in the presence of 20 nM oseltamivir.

Twenty percent of participants were selected by random sampling from
each vaccine group and age strata (18−44 yrs and 45−64 yrs) in year 1
(n = 144) and year 2 (n = 140), the MN/HI antibody levels of the subset are
representative of the whole study populations in year 1 (Fig. S3) and year
2 (Fig. S4). These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the
total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from
both egg-and cell-propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens),
and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk, and A(H3N2) HA
stalk). rHA from egg- and cell A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09, rHA
head from egg- and cell- A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2), B/
Colorado/06/2017 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata)
were tested with year 1 sera; rHA from egg- A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)
pdm09 and cell-A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1N1)pdm09, rHA head from egg- and
cell- A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2), egg- and cell- B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/
Victoria), egg- and cell-B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested
with year 2 sera. The puriﬁed and trimeric recombinant HA proteins
were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established
procedures45. For ELISA, rHA antigens were coated at 100 ng/well. Serum
samples were tested at an initial dilution of 1:400 followed by 2-fold
serial dilution. Antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human pan immunoglobulin conjugate to
detect total binding antibodies. ELISA was performed based on pre-
viously described procedures46,47. The ELISA titers were determined as
the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum samples that achieved an
optical density (OD) value of 0.2 or greater.


SEQUENCE ANALYSES

All the testing viruses used in this study were sequenced. Sequences
were analyzed against the sequences of candidate vaccine viruses (CVV)
of the study vaccines as deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian
Inﬂuenza Data (GISAID) database by BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 (Table 1).


STATISTICAL ANALYSES

Geometric mean titers (GMTs) at day 0, 1-month and 6-months, geo-
metric mean fold rise (GMFR) of antibody titers at 1-month versus day
0, and geometric mean fold reduction of antibody titers at 6 months
versus 1-month were calculated per vaccine group. “GMT egg/cell titer
ratio” (ratio = GMT to egg-grown vaccine virus or rHA/GMT to cell-
grown vaccine virus or rHA) was calculated to quantify the difference
in antibody response to egg- versus corresponding cell-propagated
vaccine virus for each vaccine group. The proportion of participants



==================== PAGE 12 ====================

with MN or HI GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4 fold was calculated to
quantify the percent of participants with antibodies predominantly
targeting egg-adapted epitopes per vaccine group. One-way ANOVA
corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s test) or nonparametric
Kruskal-Wallis test was used for multiple group comparison, two-tailed
paired t test was used to compare pre- and post-vaccination; two-tailed
unpaired t test was used to compare the post-vaccination titers
between IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm and each of the remaining 6 arms in
Year 2; Two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used for comparing pro-
portions. P < 0.05 is considered statistically signiﬁcant. SAS 9.4 (SAS
Institute) and GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) were used
for statistical analyses.
