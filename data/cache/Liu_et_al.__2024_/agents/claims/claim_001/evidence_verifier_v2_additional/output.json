While the quote is fragmented, the key information is present: RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g HA per strain, and IIV4/ccIIV4 contain 15 \u00b5g HA per strain.. The quote (and its context) directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g HA per strain, which is three times the amount in standard-dose IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g). This substantiates the first part of the claim about antigen content. The document also discusses improved immunogenicity with RIV4, supporting the second part of the claim that higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines.",

In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and spacing.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell-based A (H3N2) virus than both ccIIV4 and IIV4, which are standard-dose flu vaccines. This demonstrates greater immunogenicity for RIV4 compared to standard-dose vaccines, supporting the second part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the first part of the claim (that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content), but it does substantiate the claim about greater immunogenicity.",
