It explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4). It also states that, for A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination improved both the quality (functional neutralizing antibody response) and quantity (total HA head binding antibodies) of the immune response compared to standard-dose vaccines.
