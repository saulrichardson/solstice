RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d'. The text is garbled but clearly states that RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 3 times the HA (hemagglutinin) antigen content compared to standard-dose vaccines (which are typically 15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain).. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by stating that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 3 times the HA antigen content. The rest of the document also discusses immunogenicity comparisons between RIV4 and standard-dose vaccines, with multiple references to higher antibody responses and improved immunogenicity for RIV4. Therefore, the quote and context support the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content and that this has been linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines.",

The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) vaccination significantly increased the quantity of total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies, which is a measure of immunogenicity. This supports the second part of the claim that Flublok is linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines.

The quote (and its context) directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g HA per strain, which is three times the amount in standard-dose IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g).
