      "quote": "a cell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 3 of the document, though with some minor OCR artifacts and line breaks. The relevant passage is: 'a cell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by SanofiPasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain).' This matches the factual content of the quote to verify: it states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 3 times the intended 45 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain).. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok (RIV4) contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4). The second part of the claim, regarding greater immunogenicity, is supported elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4'), but the quote itself is sufficient to substantiate the antigen content comparison."

      "explanation": "The quote 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.' appears in the document, specifically in the following passage: 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.' The wording and factual content are essentially identical, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, line breaks).. The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (RIV4) is linked to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4), as it states that RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell-A (H3N2) virus. This is a direct measure of immunogenicity. The document also confirms elsewhere that RIV4 contains 3 times the HA antigen content of IIV4 and ccIIV4, thus linking the higher HA content to the observed greater immunogenicity."
