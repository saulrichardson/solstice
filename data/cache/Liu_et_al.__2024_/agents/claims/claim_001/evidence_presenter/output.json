      "quote": "RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody response, it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4 A, Fig. S1 A).",
      "explanation": "The quote is found in the document, though split across lines and with some minor wording differences due to formatting. On page 9, the document states: 'RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody response, it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4 A, Fig. S1 A).' This matches the quote to verify in all substantive details.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4). It also states that, for A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination improved both the quality (functional neutralizing antibody response) and quantity (total HA head binding antibodies) of the immune response compared to standard-dose vaccines. This directly links the higher HA content to greater immunogenicity, as claimed."

      "quote": "In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.",
      "explanation": "The quote 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.' appears in the document, almost verbatim, in the following passage: 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.' The factual content, technical terms, and comparison between RIV4 (Flublok), ccIIV4, and IIV4 are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (RIV4), which contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, is linked to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines. The quote explicitly states that RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell-A (H3 N2) virus than both ccIIV4 and IIV4, which are standard-dose vaccines. This is a direct measure of greater immunogenicity, thus substantiating the claim."

RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, though with some minor OCR-related differences. The relevant passage is: 'a cell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d'. While the sentence is cut off, the context and numbers match the quote: RIV4 (Flublok) contains 3 times the intended 45 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain). The factual content and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by stating that Flublok (RIV4) contains three times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4). The document also discusses immunogenicity outcomes, showing that RIV4 induced higher antibody responses in some cases, which is consistent with the claim that higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated."

      "explanation": "The quote 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.' appears in the document, specifically in the first page of the provided text. The wording is nearly identical, and the meaning and data are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (RIV4) is associated with greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4), as it states that RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell-A (H3N2) virus. This is a direct measure of immunogenicity. Additionally, elsewhere in the document, it is stated that 'RIV4 contains 3 times the ... HA/dose/strain' compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4, confirming the higher HA content. Therefore, the quote provides direct evidence that the higher HA content in Flublok is associated with greater immunogenicity, as measured by antibody responses."
