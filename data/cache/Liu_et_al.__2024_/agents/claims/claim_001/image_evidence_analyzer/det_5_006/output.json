  "claim_id": "claim_001",
  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure (Figure 4) showing ELISA-measured HA binding antibody and HA stalk antibody responses at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups: Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4 (Flublok). Panels A and B display log-scale geometric mean titers for total HA binding (egg- and cell-derived HA) across influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata, including statistical comparisons. Panel C shows H3 and H1 stalk-specific ELISA titers, and Panel D shows fold-rise in stalk titers from Day 0 to 1 month. Evidence: Statistical comparisons in the figure indicate that RIV4 (Flublok) often elicited higher ELISA antibody titers versus standard-dose vaccines at 1 month post-vaccination. The figure provides immunogenicity data showing higher antibody responses for RIV4 compared to standard-dose vaccines, but it contains no information about antigen content (e.g., 3\u00d7 HA dose). Therefore, it does not support the claim regarding antigen content and only partially addresses immunogenicity, so it doesn't support the claim. Note: The image does not include antigen dosage information. Some text and p-values are small and partially blurred, limiting detailed interpretation.",
