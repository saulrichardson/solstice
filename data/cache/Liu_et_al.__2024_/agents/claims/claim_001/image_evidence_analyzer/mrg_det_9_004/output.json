  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multiple ELISA titer plots comparing geometric mean titers (GMTs) of HA head and stalk\u2013binding antibodies for H3N2, H1pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata at day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination across seven vaccine arms (egg-based IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4 combinations). Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals; pairwise p values for select comparisons are shown. The figure presents immunogenicity data (ELISA antibody titers) for different vaccine formulations but does not provide any information on the antigen content (e.g., 3\u00d7 HA dose) of Flublok versus standard-dose vaccines; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clear but is limited to antibody titer comparisons and lacks any data on HA antigen quantities.",
