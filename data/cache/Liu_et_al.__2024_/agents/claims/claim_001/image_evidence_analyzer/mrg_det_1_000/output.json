  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram illustrating participant screening, exclusions, and randomization in Year 1 and Year 2 among three vaccine groups: IIV4 (inactivated influenza vaccine), ccIIV4 (cell-culture based IIV4), and RIV4 (Flublok\u00ae Quadrivalent). It shows numbers enrolled, re-randomized, and excluded per protocol. The figure is a participant flow diagram and does not provide any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear, but it only covers enrollment and randomization and lacks any vaccine composition or immunogenicity information.",
