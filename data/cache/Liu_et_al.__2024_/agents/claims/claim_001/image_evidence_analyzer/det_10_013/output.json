  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing demographic characteristics and prior influenza vaccination history for multiple study groups (n=122, 120, 283, 198), including mean age, age group distribution, sex, race/ethnicity, study sites, and vaccination history over the last five seasons. The table only presents participant demographics and vaccination history; it does not provide any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim.",
