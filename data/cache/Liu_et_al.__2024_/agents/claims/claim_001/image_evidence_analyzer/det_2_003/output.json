  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin proteins of various cell-grown and egg-based influenza vaccine virus strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B lineages) with footnotes on vaccine formulations and glycosylation motifs. The table details HA sequence differences in egg-adapted versus cell-grown vaccine strains and does not provide any information on HA antigen content or dosage; it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but contains only sequence substitution data and no antigen content or immunogenicity information.",
