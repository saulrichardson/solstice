  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two-panel figure showing the proportion of participants with \u22654-fold reduced HI titer to cell-derived vaccine virus (egg/cell titer ratio) pre- and 1-month post-vaccination among seven Year 1\u2013Year 2 vaccination arms (cell- and egg-based formulations and Fluzone IIV4), stratified by age group (18\u201344 years in panel A; 45\u201364 years in panel B). Each arm is represented by a different symbol and connected by lines, with p-values for significant changes. The figure only presents proportions of participants showing fold-reduced hemagglutination inhibition titers comparing egg- and cell-derived vaccine viruses across different vaccine sequences. It contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content (\u00b5g HA per dose) or comparisons of HA dosage, so it does not support the claim about Flublok containing three times the HA antigen of standard-dose vaccines. Note: Figure is clear but focused on egg versus cell immunogenicity, not antigen content; no mention of HA \u00b5g/dose.",
