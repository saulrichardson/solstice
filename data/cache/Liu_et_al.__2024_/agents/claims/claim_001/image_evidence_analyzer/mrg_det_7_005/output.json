  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and one month post-vaccination for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) across seven repeat vaccination arms (combinations of cell-based quadrivalent IIV4 (ccIIV4), recombinant HA vaccine RIV4, and egg-based IIV4 (Fluzone)). Each panel plots geometric mean titers with 95% confidence intervals and indicates statistical comparisons (p values) between the IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm and each other arm. does not support the claim because the figure presents immunogenicity data (HI titers) across different vaccine regimens but does not provide information on antigen content (e.g., HA quantity) or reference a 3\u00d7 HA dose in Flublok. Note: Based solely on visible figure content; no text in the image specifies antigen doses or HA content.",
