      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote identifies Flublok (RIV4) as a recombinant influenza vaccine and specifies that it contains a defined amount of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain, which is relevant because recombinant technology allows for precise matching to selected strains without egg-adapted mutations."

      "quote": "The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45. For ELISA, rHA antigens were coated at 100 ng/well. Serum samples were tested at an initial dilution of 1:400 followed by 2 fold serial dilution. Antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti human pan immunoglobulin conjugate to detect total binding antibodies.",
      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote describes the use of recombinant HA proteins (as in Flublok) produced in a baculovirus system, which ensures the antigens are identical to the WHO- and FDA-selected reference strains, supporting the claim of an identical antigenic match."

Sequences were analyzed against the sequences of candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) of the study vaccines as deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database by BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 (Table 1).",
      "reason": "does not support claim",

In this randomized trial (Clinical trials gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg based (IIV4), cell culture based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018-19 (N = 723) and 2019-20 (N = 684) influenza seasons.",
      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote establishes that Flublok (RIV4) is a recombinant, non-egg-based vaccine, which is important because non-egg-based production avoids egg-adapted mutations, ensuring the antigenic match to the selected strains."
