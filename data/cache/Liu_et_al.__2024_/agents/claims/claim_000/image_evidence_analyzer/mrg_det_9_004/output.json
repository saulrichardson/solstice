  "explanation": "Multiple box\u2010and\u2010whisker plots showing geometric mean ELISA titers (log2 scale) for HA head and stalk domains of H3N2, H1pdm09, B/VIC, and B/YAM at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination across seven repeat vaccination arms (cell\u2010based, recombinant [Flublok/RIV4], egg\u2010based combinations). Statistical comparisons of titers and fold rises are indicated. The figure presents immunogenicity data (antibody titers) following different vaccine sequences but contains no information on antigenic matching of Flublok to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited to what is shown: data quality is adequate but no antigenic match information is provided.",
