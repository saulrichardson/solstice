  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Figure with four panels (A\u2013D) showing immunogenicity comparisons among four influenza vaccines (Fluzone IV4, Fluarix IV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4/Flublok) in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Panels A and B display geometric mean ratios of egg- to cell-grown virus titers at one month post-vaccination with 95% CIs and p-values for each influenza strain (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM). Panels C and D show proportions of participants with \u22654-fold reduced titers to cell-grown vaccine virus pre- versus post-vaccination, with trend line p-values for RIV4. does not support the claim because the figure presents immunogenicity data comparing egg- and cell-grown vaccine antigens and shows fold-reduction in antibody titers for different vaccine platforms, but it does not address or demonstrate that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Note: Image focuses on antibody titer comparisons; no direct mention of WHO/FDA strain selection or antigenic match.",
