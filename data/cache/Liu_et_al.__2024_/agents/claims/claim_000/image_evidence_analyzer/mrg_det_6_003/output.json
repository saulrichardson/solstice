  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing antibody responses to egg-adapted versus cell-based influenza viruses in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years) for four vaccine formulations: Fluzone IIV4 (egg-based), Fluarix IIV4 (egg-based), ccIIV4 (cell-based), and RIV4 (recombinant, Flublok). Panels A and B display geometric mean ratios of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or microneutralization (MN) antibody titers against egg-adapted versus cell-based viruses for A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains with 95% confidence intervals. Panels C and D show the proportion of participants with \u22654-fold reduced titer to cell-based vaccine virus pre- and 1-month post-vaccination for each strain and vaccine group. Evidence: RIV4 (Flublok) geometric mean ratios for egg- versus cell-based virus titers remain above 1 for all strains, indicating an imperfect match; no data on WHO- or FDA-selected strain identity are presented. The figure does not support the claim because it only shows antibody titer ratios indicating some residual difference between egg-adapted and cell-based virus epitopes for RIV4 and provides no evidence of \u2018identical antigenic match\u2019 or direct confirmation of WHO/FDA strain identity. does not support the claim Note: Figure is cut off on strain selection methodology; data focus on immunogenicity assays rather than direct antigenic or sequence comparisons to WHO/FDA reference strains.",
