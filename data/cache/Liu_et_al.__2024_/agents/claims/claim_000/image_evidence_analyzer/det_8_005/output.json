  "explanation": "Two-panel figure showing proportions of participants with \u22654-fold reduced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) GMT egg-to-cell vaccine virus titer ratio (egg/cell \u22654) before (Pre) and one month after (Post) vaccination across four influenza components (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM) for seven Year-1/Year-2 prime-boost vaccine arms in two age groups (A:18\u201344 years; B:45\u201364 years). The figure presents immunogenicity data on egg versus cell vaccine virus HI responses and does not address antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clear but focuses on antibody titer ratios, not sequence or antigenic match data.",
