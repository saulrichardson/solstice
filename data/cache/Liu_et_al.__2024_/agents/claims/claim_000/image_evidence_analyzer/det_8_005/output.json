  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-panel line graph showing the dynamics of the proportion of participants with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) geometric mean titer (GMT) egg/cell ratio \u22654 pre- and 1-month post-vaccination. Panel A (18\u201344 years) and Panel B (45\u201364 years) each display data for four influenza components (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM) across seven repeat vaccination arms: ccIIV4\u2192ccIIV4, ccIIV4\u2192RIV4, RIV4\u2192ccIIV4, RIV4\u2192RIV4, IIV4\u2192ccIIV4, IIV4\u2192RIV4, and IIV4 (Fluzone)\u2192IIV4. Pre- and post-vaccination proportions are plotted with trend lines and select p-values indicating significant changes. The figure presents immunogenicity data on egg- and cell-derived vaccine virus titers across different vaccine sequences, but it does not provide any data or statements regarding Flublok\u2019s antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image is focused on HI titer ratios and vaccine immunogenicity rather than direct antigenic matching; no direct measure of match or reference to WHO/FDA selections is shown.",
