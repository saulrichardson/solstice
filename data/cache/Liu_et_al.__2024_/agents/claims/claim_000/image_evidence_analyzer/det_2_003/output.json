  "explanation": "Table listing amino acid substitutions and glycosylation motif changes in HA proteins of cell-based versus egg-based candidate vaccine viruses for various influenza strains (H1N1, H3N2, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata lineages), comparing WHO- and FDA-selected reference strains to vaccine viruses (egg- and cell-derived). The table documents antigenic differences in egg-based versus cell-based vaccine viruses but does not include any data on Flublok or demonstrate that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected strains and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Table does not mention Flublok; image is partially visible but key headings and entries are legible.",
