  "explanation": "A multi-part table listing influenza A and B vaccine virus hemagglutinin (HA) amino acid residues at specific positions for cell-propagated reference strains, egg-propagated candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs), and egg-based vaccine strains over multiple seasons. The table highlights egg-adapted substitutions (italic and bold) and notes that proteins of the reference vaccine viruses were included in the RIV4 (recombinant HA) vaccine. does not support the claim: the table details egg-adapted amino acid changes in egg-based vaccines and notes RIV4 uses proteins from cell-propagated reference viruses but provides no direct evidence that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected strains. Note: Table does not explicitly mention Flublok by name or demonstrate antigenic matching to WHO/FDA strains; inference about match is not directly shown.",
