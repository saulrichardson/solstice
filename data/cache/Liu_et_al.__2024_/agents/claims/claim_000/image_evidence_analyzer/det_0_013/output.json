  "explanation": "An excerpt from a Nature Communications (2024) article showing text paragraphs about repeat influenza vaccination, study identifiers (NCT03722589), and conventional inactivated influenza vaccines (egg-based IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4), with portions of introductory background text on influenza vaccination in humans. does not support the claim because the image contains narrative text about different vaccine types and study design but provides no data or statements indicating that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. Note: The image shows only partial text and no table; resolution is limited but no relevant evidence is visible.",
