  "explanation": "Grid of box-and-whisker plots showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (Log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination to egg- and cell-propagated vaccine viruses for A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, and B/YAM strains, stratified by seven repeat vaccination arms including cell-based IIV4 (ccIIV4), recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4), and egg-based IIV4 (IIV4). P values compare post-vaccination geometric mean titers (GMTs) against cell versus egg virus within each arm. The figure presents immunogenicity (HI titer) comparisons between egg- and cell-propagated viruses across vaccine arms, but it does not provide data on the genetic or antigenic match of Flublok (RIV4) to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to the visible immunogenicity data; no information on sequence or antigenic characterization versus WHO/FDA reference strains.",
