  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Each panel compares geometric mean titers with 95% confidence intervals across seven repeat vaccination arms (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-IIV4) against egg- and cell-propagated vaccine viruses. P values for between-group comparisons are indicated. The figure presents immunogenicity data (HI titers) across different repeat vaccination arms but does not provide any information on antigenic matching of vaccine HA to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image focuses on antibody responses rather than sequence or antigenic match data; resolution and labeling are adequate for this determination.",
