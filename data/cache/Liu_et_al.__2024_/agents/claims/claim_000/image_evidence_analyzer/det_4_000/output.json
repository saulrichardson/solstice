  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Six-panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise of microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A, B) and geometric mean fold reduction of antibody titers at 6 months post-vaccination (panels C, D) for two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Each panel compares four influenza vaccine formulations (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-culture IIV4 [ccIIV4], and recombinant IIV4 [RIV4]) against egg- and cell-propagated strains of A(H3N2), A(H1N1), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses, with p values for pairwise comparisons. The figure presents immunogenicity data (antibody titer fold rises and declines) for different vaccine formulations against egg- and cell-propagated strains, but it does not show any information on antigenic matching of Flublok (RIV4) to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: RIV4 likely corresponds to Flublok, but the figure only reports antibody responses, not direct antigenic match data. No sequence or antigenic characterization is displayed.",
