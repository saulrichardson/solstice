  "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold-rise and fold-reduction of antibody titers at 1-month and 6-months post-vaccination in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) for four vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-culture IIV4, and recombinant IIV4 [RIV4]) against egg- and cell-propagated A(H3N2), A(H1N1), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata antigens (95% CIs and p-values for comparisons). does not support the claim because the figure only presents immunogenicity data against egg- and cell-propagated viral antigens and does not provide any information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Note: Analysis limited to visible immunogenicity data; no sequence or antigenic characterization is shown.",
