  "explanation": "A table showing demographic characteristics of study participants across four groups (n=122, n=120, n=283, n=198), including mean age, age group distribution, sex, race/ethnicity, study sites, and influenza vaccination history. The table only presents baseline participant demographics and vaccination history and does not address antigenic matching with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Only demographic data are visible; no information on antigenic match or vaccine strain selection is provided.",
