  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) against egg-grown and cell-grown influenza HA antigens (H3N2, H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) and HA stalk proteins at pre-vaccination, 1-month, and 6-months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4). Panel B shows egg/cell HA ELISA titer ratios. Panels C and D show HA stalk antibody responses and fold-rise. The figure presents post-vaccination antibody titers and comparisons among vaccine types but does not provide any data on the antigenic match or sequence identity between Flublok strains and WHO/FDA-selected strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Vaccines are labeled as RIV4 for the recombinant vaccine (presumably Flublok), but the figure does not include any information on antigenic matching or strain selection criteria.",
