  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA-measured hemagglutinin (HA) binding antibody titers (log2 scale) to egg-grown and cell-grown HA antigens for A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4). Panel B shows geometric mean ratios of egg- versus cell-derived HA ELISA titers. Panel C shows H3 and H1 stalk-specific antibody titers over time. Panel D shows fold-rise in HA stalk titers from Day 0 to 1 month. The figure reports immunogenicity (antibody titers) against different HA antigens but provides no data on antigenic sequence identity or official WHO/FDA strain matches; therefore it does not support the claim Note: Analysis limited to visible immunogenicity data; no sequence or regulatory matching information is presented",
