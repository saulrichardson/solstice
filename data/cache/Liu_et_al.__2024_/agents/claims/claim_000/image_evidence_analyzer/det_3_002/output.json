  "explanation": "Graphs of microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (log2 scale) against egg- and cell-propagated influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination. Four vaccine groups (egg-based IIV4s Fluzone and Fluarix, cell-culture IIV4, and recombinant HA RIV4/Flublok) are compared with geometric mean titers and p-values for intergroup differences. The figure shows immune responses to different virus preparations by vaccine type but contains no data on antigenic sequence matching or demonstration that Flublok antigens are identical to WHO- or FDA-selected strains; it does not support the claim. Note: Interpretation limited to immunogenicity data; no antigenic or sequence comparison presented.",
