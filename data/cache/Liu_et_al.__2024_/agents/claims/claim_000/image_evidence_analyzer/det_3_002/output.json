  "explanation": "A multi\u2010panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post\u2010vaccination for four influenza vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) against A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains, with GMTs, 95% CIs, individual data points, and p values for between\u2010group comparisons. The figure reports immunogenicity (antibody titers) for different vaccines over time but does not present data on antigenic matching of Flublok (RIV4) to WHO\u2010 or FDA\u2010selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim.",
