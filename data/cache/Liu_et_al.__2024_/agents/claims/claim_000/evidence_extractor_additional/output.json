      "quote": "The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45. For ELISA, rHA antigens were coated at 100 ng/well. Serum samples were tested at an initial dilution of 1:400 followed by 2 fold serial dilution. Antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti human pan immunoglobulin conjugate to detect total binding antibodies. ELISA was performed based on previously described procedures 46 47. The ELISA titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum samples that achieved an optical density (OD) value of 0.2 or greater. Sequence analyses All the testing viruses used in this study were sequenced. Sequences were analyzed against the sequences of candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) of the study vaccines as deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database by BioEdit version 7 0 9 0 (Table 1).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes that the recombinant HA proteins (such as those used in Flublok) are produced using the baculovirus system and that their sequences are analyzed and matched to the candidate vaccine viruses recommended by WHO and FDA, supporting the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match.",
