      "quote": "a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain and is produced using recombinant DNA technology in insect cells, ensuring that the HA antigens are identical to the WHO- and FDA-recommended vaccine strains without egg-adapted mutations.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) is produced using recombinant DNA technology in insect cells, which ensures that the hemagglutinin (HA) antigens are identical to the WHO- and FDA-recommended vaccine strains and do not contain egg-adapted mutations. This directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with the selected flu strains."
