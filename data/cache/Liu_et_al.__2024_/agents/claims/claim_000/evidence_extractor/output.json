      "relevance_explanation": "This quote identifies Flublok (RIV4) as a recombinant influenza vaccine, which is relevant because recombinant vaccines are not produced in eggs and thus avoid egg-adapted mutations, supporting the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains."
