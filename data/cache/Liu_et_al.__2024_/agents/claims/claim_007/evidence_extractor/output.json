      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4, produced using BEVS) induced higher levels of antibodies to the cell-derived (i.e., non-egg-adapted) H3N2 virus, supporting the claim that BEVS-produced antigens induce higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies compared to egg-derived vaccines."

      "quote": "The RIV4 group had the highest A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk and A (H3 N2) HA stalk antibodies at 1 month post vaccination, however the fold rises of HA stalk antibodies were low (<1.8) and similar among all 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 4 D).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that the RIV4 (recombinant, BEVS-produced) group had the highest levels of HA stalk antibodies, which are broadly cross-reactive and target highly conserved regions of HA, compared to the other (including egg-derived) vaccine groups."

      "quote": "For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody ... it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4 A, Fig. S1 A).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by stating that RIV4 (recombinant, BEVS) vaccination increased both the quality and quantity of antibodies binding to the cell-derived (non-egg-adapted, more conserved) HA, indicating a broader and more cross-reactive response than egg-derived vaccines."
