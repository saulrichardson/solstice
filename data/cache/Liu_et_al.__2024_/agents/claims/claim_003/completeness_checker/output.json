The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and formatting.. The quote directly supports the claim that recombinant technology (RIV4) leads to a broader immune response. It shows that RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to a cell-based (i.e., more wild-type-like) H3N2 virus compared to both cell-based and egg-based inactivated vaccines. This demonstrates that RIV4 can generate a stronger immune response to antigens that are closer to circulating strains, supporting the idea of broader and potentially cross-protective immunity, especially in seasons where there is a mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains.",

There are no significant differences between the provided quote and the text in the document.. The quote directly states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses. This implies that egg-based vaccines may narrow the immune response, making it less effective against circulating (potentially mismatched) viruses. By contrast, the claim is that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. The quote supports the claim by highlighting a limitation of egg-based vaccines that recombinant vaccines are designed to overcome, thus supporting the idea that recombinant technology can provide broader immunity.",

The quote directly supports the claim. It shows that recombinant (RIV4) and cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccines do not preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted epitopes, unlike egg-based vaccines. This implies that the immune response is not narrowly focused on egg-adapted changes, and thus is likely broader and more reflective of circulating viruses.
