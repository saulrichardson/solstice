For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody ... it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4 A, Fig. S1 A).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote indicates that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) not only improved the quality but also the quantity of antibodies against the cell-propagated H3N2 virus, which is more representative of circulating strains, thus supporting a broader and potentially cross-protective immune response.",
