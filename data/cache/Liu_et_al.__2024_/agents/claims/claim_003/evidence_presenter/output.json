      "quote": "In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.",
      "explanation": "A very close version of the quote appears on page 1: 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and formatting.. The quote directly supports the claim that recombinant technology (RIV4) leads to a broader immune response. It shows that RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to a cell-based (i.e., more wild-type-like) H3N2 virus compared to both cell-based and egg-based inactivated vaccines. This demonstrates that RIV4 can generate a stronger immune response to antigens that are closer to circulating strains, supporting the idea of broader and potentially cross-protective immunity, especially in seasons where there is a mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains."

      "quote": "Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epi topes and reduce immuno- gen i city to circulating viruses.",
      "explanation": "The quote 'Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epi topes and reduce immuno- gen i city to circulating viruses.' appears verbatim on page 1 of the document. There are no significant differences between the provided quote and the text in the document.. The quote directly states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses. This implies that egg-based vaccines may narrow the immune response, making it less effective against circulating (potentially mismatched) viruses. By contrast, the claim is that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. The quote supports the claim by highlighting a limitation of egg-based vaccines that recombinant vaccines are designed to overcome, thus supporting the idea that recombinant technology can provide broader immunity."

      "quote": "In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio \u22654 did not increase after vaccination, suggesting that non-egg based vaccines do not preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted epitopes.",
      "explanation": "A very close version of the quote appears on page 5: 'After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg- based vaccines generally reinforced the neutralizing antibody responses to egg adapted epi to pes as evidenced by an increased trend in the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio \u22654. In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of parti-' (the sentence is cut off but the meaning is clear and matches the quote to verify). The next lines and context confirm the intended meaning: 'the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio \u22654 did not increase after vaccination, suggesting that non-egg based vaccines do not preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted epitopes.'. The quote directly supports the claim. It shows that recombinant (RIV4) and cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccines do not preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted epitopes, unlike egg-based vaccines. This implies that the immune response is not narrowly focused on egg-adapted changes, and thus is likely broader and more reflective of circulating viruses. This broader response is what underlies the potential for cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, as the claim asserts."

      "quote": "Comparing pre- and 1 month post vaccination, A (H3 N2) HA stalk binding antibodies were significantly boosted in ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, and IIV4-RIV4 arms, while A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk binding antibodies were also significantly boosted in ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and RIV4-ccIIV4 arms.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears almost verbatim on page 7: 'Comparing pre- and 1 month post vaccination, A (H3 N2) HA stalk binding antibodies were significantly boosted in ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, and IIV4-RIV4 arms, while A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk binding antibodies were also significantly boosted in ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and RIV4-ccIIV4 arms (Fig. 8 C).' The wording and meaning are essentially identical to the quote to verify.. The quote provides direct evidence that recombinant (RIV4) and cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccine regimens, especially those involving recombinant technology, significantly boost HA stalk binding antibodies. HA stalk antibodies are known to be more conserved and cross-reactive, which is the immunological basis for broader and potentially cross-protective responses, even in seasons where the vaccine and circulating strains are mismatched. Thus, the data in the quote directly support the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection."

      "quote": "RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody response to A (H3 N2) virus, it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies.",
      "explanation": "A very similar version of the quote appears on page 9: 'For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody... it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4 A, Fig. S1 A).' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in phrasing and sentence structure.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (recombinant influenza vaccine) improved both the quality (functional neutralizing antibody response) and the quantity (total HA head binding antibodies) of the immune response to A (H3 N2) cell-based antigens. This supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response, which may provide cross-protection, especially in seasons where the vaccine and circulating strains are mismatched. The improvement in both quality and quantity of antibodies to cell-based (wild-type-like) antigens is evidence of a broader and potentially cross-protective immune response."

The quote is truncated in the document, but the key content and structure match the quote to verify.. The quote directly states that repeat vaccination with recombinant (RIV4) or cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccines 'further improved antibody responses to circulating' viruses. This supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, because it shows that these vaccine technologies enhance antibody responses to the actual circulating (not just vaccine-matched) viruses. The improvement in antibody responses implies a broader and potentially more cross-protective immune response."

      "quote": "Multiple seasons of non-eg based vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immune memory to egg adapted epi to pes and re-focus the immune response towards epi to pes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effective nes",
      "explanation": "The quote appears almost verbatim on the first page of the document: 'Multiple seasons of non-eg based vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immune memory to egg adapted epi to pes and re-focus the immune response towards epi to pes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effective nes'. The only differences are minor typographical errors and spacing, but the core content is identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that multiple seasons of non-egg-based (e.g., recombinant) vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from egg-adapted epitopes (which are not always present on circulating viruses) to epitopes on the circulating viruses. This implies that non-egg-based vaccines can help refocus the immune response toward a broader set of viral epitopes, which is consistent with a broader and potentially more cross-protective immune response, especially in seasons where the vaccine and circulating strains are mismatched."
