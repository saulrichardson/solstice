  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Multi\u2010panel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post\u2013year-2 vaccination for four influenza viruses (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Each panel displays geometric mean titers with 95% confidence intervals for seven repeat vaccination arms (cell-culture quadrivalent [ccIIV4], recombinant quadrivalent [RIV4], and egg-based quadrivalent [IIV4] in various sequences). Colored horizontal bars denote statistically significant differences (p-values) between the IIV4\u2013IIV4 arm and other arms against cell-propagated viruses. Evidence: RIV4-containing arms (both RIV4\u2013RIV4 and mixed RIV4 sequences) show significantly higher HI GMTs to A(H3N2) cell-propagated virus at 1 month compared with the egg-based IIV4\u2013IIV4 arm (p<0.0001, p=0.013, etc.). The figure supports the claim by demonstrating that recombinant vaccine arms elicit higher antibody titers to cell-propagated (i.e., mismatched) A(H3N2) virus compared with egg-based vaccination, indicating a broader immune response and potential cross-protection. Note: Some labels and small-print details are difficult to read; data shown are immunogenicity (HI titers) rather than direct clinical protection.",
