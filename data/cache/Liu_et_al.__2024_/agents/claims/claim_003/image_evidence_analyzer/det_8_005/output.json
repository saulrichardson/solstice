  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "Two-panel figure displaying proportions of participants with \u22654-fold reduced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer ratios (egg-grown vs cell-grown vaccine virus) for four influenza components (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) before and one month after vaccination. The data are shown for seven repeat vaccination arms (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, and IIV4\u2013Fluzone IIV4), separated by age groups 18\u201344 years (panel A) and 45\u201364 years (panel B), with trend lines and p-values indicating significant changes. does not support the claim because the figure only addresses egg-adaptation effects by comparing egg-grown versus cell-grown vaccine virus titers, without demonstrating broader cross-strain immune responses or cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: Image limited to egg-versus-cell growth comparisons; no data on drifted strains or mismatch season cross-protection.",
