  "explanation": "A table listing antigenic site amino acid sequences of various influenza vaccine viruses (cell-based and egg-based candidate vaccine viruses) across multiple strains and lineages, highlighting egg-adapted substitutions and glycosylation motif losses. The table presents sequence comparisons between cell-based and egg-based vaccine viruses and notes egg-adapted amino acid substitutions, but it does not address recombinant vaccine technology or provide any immunogenicity or cross-protection data, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for sequence data but contains no immunological response or recombinant vaccine information.",
