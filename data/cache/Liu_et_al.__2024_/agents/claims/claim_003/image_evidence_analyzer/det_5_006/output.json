  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Figure 4 presents ELISA-measured HA head (egg\u2010 and cell\u2010derived HA, Panel A) and HA stalk (Panels C and D) antibody responses at pre\u2010vaccination (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months after vaccination for four vaccine groups: two egg-based IIV4s (Fluzone and FluLaval), a cell-culture IIV4 (ccIIV4), and a recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4). Panel B shows the ratio of egg- to cell-derived HA head binding titers at 1 month. Grey dots indicate individual titers; colored bars and error bars indicate geometric mean titers (GMTs) with 95% CIs. Statistical comparisons (p-values) are annotated. Evidence: In Panels C and D, the RIV4 (recombinant) group exhibits significantly higher H3 and H1 stalk antibody GMTs and fold\u2010rise at 1 month compared to the egg-based vaccines, indicating enhanced induction of stalk\u2010directed (conserved) antibodies. The elevated HA stalk antibody responses elicited by the recombinant RIV4 vaccine, as shown in Panels C and D, support the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response; stalk antibodies target conserved regions and are associated with potential cross-protection, even in mismatch seasons, so this immunogenicity data supports the claim. Note: The figure demonstrates immunogenicity (stalk antibody levels) but does not directly measure clinical cross-protection or efficacy in a mismatch season; results are surrogate markers.",
