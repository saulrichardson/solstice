  "explanation": "A CONSORT diagram showing the flow of participants from Year 1 into Year 2 of a clinical study, with numbers re-enrolled and randomized into arms receiving IIV4 (inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine), cell-culture based IIV4, or RIV4 (recombinant-hemagglutinin influenza vaccine), along with exclusions and subgroup counts. The figure only depicts participant screening and randomization flow; it provides no data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or performance in a mismatch season and therefore does not support the claim Note: Limited by the figure showing only enrollment and randomization numbers, without any immunogenicity or cross-protection results.",
