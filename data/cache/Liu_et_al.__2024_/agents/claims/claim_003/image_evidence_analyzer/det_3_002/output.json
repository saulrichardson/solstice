  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel Figure showing microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (Log2 scale) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) against egg- and cell-propagated A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains. Statistical significance between groups is indicated by p values on horizontal bars. The figure shows that recombinant vaccines (ccIIV4 and RIV4) elicit higher antibody titers compared to egg-based vaccines, but it does not present data on cross-protection against mismatched strains or a mismatch season, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image provides robust immunogenicity comparisons but lacks any mismatched or divergent strain challenge data; small text and dense panels may limit full interpretation.",
