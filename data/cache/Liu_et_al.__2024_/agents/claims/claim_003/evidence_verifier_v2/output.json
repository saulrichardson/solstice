This matches the quote to verify in all substantive details.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that non-egg-based vaccines (including recombinant RIV4) induced a broader antibody response to both egg and cell propagated viruses, as opposed to egg-based vaccines, which reinforced a narrower, egg-adapted response. This broader response is relevant to the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. The quote provides explicit comparative immunogenicity data supporting the claim.",
