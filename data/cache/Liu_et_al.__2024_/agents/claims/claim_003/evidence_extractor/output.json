      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) generated a stronger immune response against the cell-propagated (i.e., circulating) H3N2 virus compared to both cell-based and egg-based vaccines, supporting the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response."

      "quote": "After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg based vaccines generally reinforced the neutralizing antibody responses to egg adapted epitopes as evidenced by an increased trend in the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio \u22654. In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio \u22654 was significantly lower, suggesting that non egg based vaccines induced a broader antibody response to both egg and cell propagated viruses.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly compares the immune response profiles, showing that recombinant (and cell-based) vaccines avoid the narrow, egg-adapted response and instead induce broader immunity, which is relevant for cross-protection in mismatch seasons."

      "quote": "RIV4 contains 3 times the amount of HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody response, it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote highlights that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) not only increases the amount but also the quality of antibodies against the cell-propagated (circulating) H3N2 virus, supporting the claim of a broader immune response."

      "quote": "Comparing pre- and 1 month post vaccination, A (H3 N2) HA stalk binding antibodies were significantly boosted in ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, and IIV4-RIV4 arms, while A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk binding antibodies were also significantly boosted in ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and RIV4-ccIIV4 arms.",

      "quote": "The potential of non egg based vaccines to mitigate the impact of prior egg based vaccination remains unclear. In this study, repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses compared to repeated egg based vaccination.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that recombinant (and cell-based) vaccines enhance immune responses to circulating (i.e., potentially mismatched) viruses, supporting the claim of broader and cross-protective immunity."
