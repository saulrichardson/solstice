The quote is truncated in the document, but the key content and structure match the quote to verify.. The quote directly states that repeat vaccination with recombinant (RIV4) or cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccines 'further improved antibody responses to circulating' viruses. This supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, because it shows that these vaccine technologies enhance antibody responses to the actual circulating (not just vaccine-matched) viruses. The improvement in antibody responses implies a broader and potentially more cross-protective immune response.",

The only differences are minor typographical errors and spacing, but the core content is identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that multiple seasons of non-egg-based (e.g., recombinant) vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from egg-adapted epitopes (which are not always present on circulating viruses) to epitopes on the circulating viruses. This implies that non-egg-based vaccines can help refocus the immune response toward a broader set of viral epitopes, which is consistent with a broader and potentially more cross-protective immune response, especially in seasons where the vaccine and circulating strains are mismatched.",
