      "explanation": "The quote 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.' appears in the document, almost verbatim, in the following sentence: 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.' This is found in the first long paragraph of the document, and the factual content, numbers, and technical details are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim that recombinant technology (RIV4) leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. The quote explicitly states that RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to the cell-propagated (wild-type-like) A (H3 N2) virus compared to the other vaccines. Since cell-propagated viruses are more similar to circulating strains than egg-adapted ones, this demonstrates that RIV4 elicits a stronger and potentially broader immune response, supporting the claim without requiring inference beyond what is stated.",
