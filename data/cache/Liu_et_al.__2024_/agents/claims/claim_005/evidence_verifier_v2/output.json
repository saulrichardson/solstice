The wording and numbers match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly identifies Fluarix IIV4 as one of the quadrivalent standard-dose vaccines used in the trial, with specific enrollment and follow-up numbers. The broader context of the document confirms that Flublok (RIV4, recombinant quadrivalent) was evaluated in the same trial, and the quote shows that Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose) was a comparator.
