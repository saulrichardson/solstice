The only differences are minor (spacing, line breaks, and 'trim eric' instead of 'trimeric', 'baculo virus' instead of 'baculovirus'), but the core content is identical.. The quote directly states that recombinant HA proteins (the antigen in Flublok) were expressed using a baculovirus system. This is the core of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) platform, which is the 'novel production platform' referenced in the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS.",
