      "explanation": "A very close version of the quote appears in the document, specifically in the first paragraph: 'manufacturing process can lead to egg adapted mutations in themagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered an ...iff i (VE) i h i l i'. The text is garbled at the end, but the core content about the manufacturing process leading to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein, which could result in altered vaccine effectiveness (VE), is clearly present.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that the manufacturing process (specifically for egg-based vaccines) can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, and that these mutations could result in altered vaccine effectiveness (VE). This directly substantiates the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."

      "quote": "Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epi topes and reduce immuno- gen i city to circulating viruses.",
      "explanation": "The quote 'Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epi topes and reduce immuno- gen i city to circulating viruses.' appears almost verbatim on page 1 of the document. The only differences are minor spacing and line breaks, but the core content and meaning are identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted epitopes (mutations that arise during egg-based production) and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses. This means the immune response is focused on the mutated (egg-adapted) version rather than the actual circulating virus, which can reduce vaccine effectiveness. This is a direct mechanistic explanation of how mutations during production may reduce effectiveness, as the claim asserts."

      "quote": "have reported that Q223 R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1 N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigen i city and influence immune response 37 42.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 9: 'have reported that Q223 R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1 N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigen i city and influence immune response 37 42.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor spacing and formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the claim. It specifically describes an egg-adapted mutation (Q223R) in the HA head domain of A(H1N1)pdm09 that arises during egg-based vaccine production. The quote states that this mutation can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity, and influence immune response. These changes can potentially reduce vaccine effectiveness, which is the essence of the claim. The quote is a concrete example of how mutations during production (specifically in eggs) can impact vaccine performance."

      "quote": "the antibody \u201cGMT egg cell titer ratio\u201d as a proxy to quantify the extent of difference in antibody responses to egg- versus year 1, a total of 26 breakthrough infection cases were identified with",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5: 'Antibody responses to egg adapted epi to pes measured by antibody GMT egg cell titer ratio in year 1 To assess the levels of antibody responses targeting the egg adapted epi to pes, we used the antibody \u201cGMT egg cell titer ratio\u201d as a proxy to quantify the extent of difference in antibody responses to egg- versus year 1, a total of 26 breakthrough infection cases were identified with'. The wording is nearly identical, with only minor differences in punctuation and line breaks.. The quote describes the use of the 'GMT egg cell titer ratio' as a proxy to quantify differences in antibody responses to egg- versus cell-derived viruses. This difference arises because egg-based production can introduce mutations (egg-adapted changes) in the virus, leading to antigenic differences. The need to measure and compare these responses directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness by altering immune responses."

      "quote": "participants had GMT egg cell ratio \u22654 to A (H3 N2) and B/Victoria viruses, suggesting ahigh prevalence of pre existing neutralizing antibodies targeting HA egg adapted epi to pes in this highly vaccinated HCP population.

      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in wording and punctuation: 'participants had GMT egg cell ratio \u22654 to A (H3 N2) and B/Victoria viruses, suggesting ahigh prevalence of pre existing neutralizing antibodies targeting HA egg adapted epi to pes in this highly vaccinated HCP population. After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg- based vaccines generally reinforced the neutralizing antibody responses to egg adapted epi to pes as evidenced by an increased trend in the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio \u22654.' This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, and line breaks).. The quote directly supports the claim. It shows that egg-based vaccines reinforce immune responses to 'egg adapted epitopes,' which are the result of mutations that occur during egg-based production. The use of the 'GMT egg cell ratio \u22654' as a marker for antibodies targeting these egg-adapted epitopes demonstrates that such mutations are present and immunologically relevant. The fact that vaccination with egg-based vaccines increases the proportion of participants with this response suggests that the immune system is being directed toward these egg-adapted (i.e., mutated) forms, which may differ from the circulating strains, thus potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness. This is direct evidence that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may impact their effectiveness."

      "quote": "epi to pes could be preferentially boosted from repeat vaccination with egg based vaccines 3 The potential of non egg based vaccines to miti",
      "explanation": "A very similar version of the quote appears on page 2: 'Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epi topes and reduce immuno- gen i city to circulating viruses.' The phrase 'epi to pes could be preferentially boosted from repeat vaccination with egg based vaccines' also appears, though the sentence is cut off. The core content is present, with only minor wording and formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that repeat vaccination with egg-based vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted epitopes, which are created by mutations during egg-based production. It also notes that this can reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses, implying reduced effectiveness. This directly links the production-induced mutations in egg-based (and by extension, cell-based) vaccines to potential reductions in vaccine effectiveness."
