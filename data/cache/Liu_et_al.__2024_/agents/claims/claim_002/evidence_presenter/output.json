      "quote": "The manufacturing process can lead to egg adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and differences in vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the first paragraph of the document, though with some minor OCR artifacts and word breaks. The relevant sentence is: 'manufacturing process can lead to egg adapted mutations in themagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered an ...iff i (VE) i h i l i'. Despite the OCR issues, the meaning is preserved: the manufacturing process can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein in inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), which could result in altered antigenicity and differences in vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the manufacturing process (specifically for egg-based vaccines) can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein, which could alter antigenicity and result in differences in vaccine effectiveness. This matches the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."

      "quote": "Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.",
      "explanation": "The quote 'Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.' appears verbatim in the document, near the beginning of the main text. The only differences are minor formatting/spacing, but the factual content and meaning are identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted (i.e., mutated during production) epitopes, and that this can reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses. This means that mutations arising during egg-based vaccine production can lead to immune responses that are less effective against the actual circulating strains, thus potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness. This is exactly what the claim asserts."

      "quote": "Vaccine egg adapted changes had the most impact on A (H3 N2) immunogenicity.",
      "explanation": "The quote 'Vaccine egg adapted changes had the most impact on A (H3 N2) immunogenicity.' appears verbatim on page 1 of the document: 'We performed an exploratory analysis. Vaccine egg adapted changes had the most impact on A (H3 N2) immunogenicity.' The wording and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly states that egg-adapted changes (mutations that occur during egg-based vaccine production) had the most impact on the immunogenicity of the A (H3 N2) influenza strain. This supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness, as immunogenicity is a key component of vaccine effectiveness. The document explicitly links egg-adapted changes to altered immune responses, substantiating the claim."

      "quote": "Comparative immunogenicity studies and provide additional information to identify optimal vaccination strategies to prevent influenza. ... have reported that Q223R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1 N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in two parts in the document. The first part, 'findings from comparative immunogenicity studies and provide additional information to identify optimal vaccination strategies to prevent influenza,' is found on page 11. The second part, 'have reported that Q223R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1 N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response,' is found on page 9. The factual content and technical details are preserved, though the two sentences are separated in the document.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the Q223R egg-adapted mutation in the HA head domain of A (H1N1)pdm09 virus can arise during egg-based vaccine production, and that this mutation can alter antigenicity and influence the immune response. This demonstrates that mutations can develop during production and may impact vaccine effectiveness, which is the essence of the claim."

      "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table comparing hemagglutinin amino acid sequences of influenza vaccine candidate viruses grown in cell culture versus in eggs for multiple strains (A(H1N1), A(H3N2), B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Mutations in egg\u2010based candidate vaccine viruses are highlighted in bold and italics, with notes on loss of glycosylation motifs (e.g., CHO-). Footnotes explain which viruses were used in egg\u2010 and cell\u2010based vaccines. Evidence: Egg\u2010based CVVs display specific amino acid substitutions (italic and bold) and loss of glycosylation motifs not present in the corresponding cell\u2010based CVVs (e.g., N197D, K\u2192R changes). supports the claim because the table documents egg\u2010adapted mutations arising during egg\u2010based vaccine production, demonstrating the potential for production\u2010induced mutations that can alter antigenic sites Note: The table illustrates egg\u2010adapted mutations but does not explicitly show mutations arising during cell\u2010based production nor provide direct clinical effectiveness data."
