The wording is nearly identical, with only minor differences in punctuation and line breaks.. The quote describes the use of the 'GMT egg cell titer ratio' as a proxy to quantify differences in antibody responses to egg- versus cell-derived viruses. This difference arises because egg-based production can introduce mutations (egg-adapted changes) in the virus, leading to antigenic differences. The need to measure and compare these responses directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness by altering immune responses.",

This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, and line breaks).. The quote directly supports the claim. It shows that egg-based vaccines reinforce immune responses to 'egg adapted epitopes,' which are the result of mutations that occur during egg-based production. The use of the 'GMT egg cell ratio \u22654' as a marker for antibodies targeting these egg-adapted epitopes demonstrates that such mutations are present and immunologically relevant. The fact that vaccination with egg-based vaccines increases the proportion of participants with this response suggests that the immune system is being directed toward these egg-adapted (i.e., mutated) forms, which may differ from the circulating strains, thus potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness. This is direct evidence that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may impact their effectiveness.",
