  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Figure showing ELISA antibody binding titers to hemagglutinin (HA) measured at pre-vaccination, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (two egg-based: Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4; one cell-based: ccIIV4; one recombinant: RIV4). Panel A compares responses against egg-derived versus cell-derived whole HA for H3N2, A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. Panel B shows the geometric mean ratio of ELISA titers to egg versus cell HA at 1 month. Panel C displays stalk-specific antibody titers (H3 stalk and H1 stalk) over time. Panel D presents the fold-rise in stalk antibody titers (1 month vs day 0). Statistical comparisons between vaccine groups are indicated by p values. The figure does not support the claim: it presents antibody titers against egg- and cell-derived HA antigens but does not show any data on mutations arising during vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, so it doesn't support the claim. Note: No direct sequence or mutation data are shown; conclusions are limited to antibody binding comparisons.",
