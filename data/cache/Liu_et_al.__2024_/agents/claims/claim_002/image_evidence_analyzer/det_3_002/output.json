  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure presenting immune response data (microneutralization titers for A(H3N2) and hemagglutination inhibition titers for H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata) measured at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination in four vaccine groups (egg-based Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4). Geometric mean titers with 95% confidence intervals, individual data points, and p-values comparing groups are shown. The figure compares antibody titers across vaccine types but does not provide any data on mutations arising during egg- or cell-based production or directly link such mutations to reduced effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: Interpretation limited to immunogenicity data; no sequence or production-mutation information is presented.",
