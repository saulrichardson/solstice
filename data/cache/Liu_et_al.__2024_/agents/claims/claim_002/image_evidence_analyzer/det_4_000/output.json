  "explanation": "Multi-panel scatter plots showing geometric mean fold-rise of MN or HI antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A, B) and fold-reduction at 6 months (panels C, D) for four influenza vaccines (egg-based IIV4 Fluzone, egg-based IIV4 Fluarix, cell-based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4) in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) against egg-propagated and cell-propagated A(H3N2), A(H1N1), B/VIC and B/YAM viruses, with p-values for pairwise comparisons The figure compares immunogenicity of vaccines against egg- and cell-propagated viruses but does not provide any direct evidence of mutations arising during vaccine production or link those mutations to reduced effectiveness, so it doesn't support the claim Note: Resolution of some p-values and small text may limit precise reading, but no mutation data are presented",
