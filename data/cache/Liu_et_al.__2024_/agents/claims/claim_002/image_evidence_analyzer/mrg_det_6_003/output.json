  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Panels A and B display geometric mean ratios of egg-grown versus cell-grown virus titers for four vaccine types (egg-based Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4; cell-based ccIIV4; recombinant RIV4) in adults aged 18\u201344 years (A) and 45\u201364 years (B), with 95% confidence intervals and p-values for group comparisons. Panels C and D show the proportions of participants with \u22654-fold reduced neutralizing titers to cell-grown virus pre- and 1-month post-vaccination across the same vaccine groups for both age cohorts. Evidence: Egg-based vaccines (Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4) exhibit significantly elevated egg/cell titer ratios for A(H3N2) (e.g., p=0.0014 and p=0.0021 in 18\u201344 year-olds) and reduced proportions of robust responses to cell-grown virus, indicating egg-adapted antigenic changes. The figure demonstrates that egg-based vaccines acquire egg-adapted mutations that reduce antibody responses to cell-grown virus, but it does not provide any data on mutations arising during cell-based vaccine production, so it does not support the claim with respect to cell-based vaccines. Note: No direct sequencing or mutation analysis is shown; the data are limited to functional titer comparisons and do not address cell-production mutation potential.",
