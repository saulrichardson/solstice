  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure displaying ELISA-measured geometric mean titers (GMTs) of head and stalk binding antibody responses (log\u2082 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination across seven repeat vaccination arms (combinations of cell-based, egg-based, and recombinant influenza vaccines). Individual titers are shown as dots, with bars indicating GMT and 95% CI, and p-values for paired comparisons. The figure presents antibody response data for different vaccine regimens but does not provide any information on the occurrence of mutations during vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim.",
