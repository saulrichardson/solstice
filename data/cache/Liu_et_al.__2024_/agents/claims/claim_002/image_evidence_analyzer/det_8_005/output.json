  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image is a two\u2010panel figure (A and B) showing the proportion of study participants in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years) with a \u22654\u2010fold reduced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer to cell\u2010grown vaccine virus versus egg\u2010grown vaccine virus, measured before and one month after vaccination. Data are shown for four influenza components (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) across seven different repeat vaccination arms, with symbols and lines indicating pre- to post-vaccination changes and annotated p-values for significant trends. The figure shows immunogenicity differences between responses to egg-grown versus cell-grown vaccine viruses, but it does not present direct evidence of mutations arising during vaccine production or link those mutations to reduced vaccine effectiveness; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: No significant image quality issues; interpretation limited by lack of direct mutation data.",
