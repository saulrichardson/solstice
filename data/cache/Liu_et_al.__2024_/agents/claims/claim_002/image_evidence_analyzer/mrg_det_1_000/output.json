  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram depicting participant screening, enrollment, exclusions, and re-randomization across two years of a clinical study comparing inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4), cell-culture based IIV (ccIIV4), and recombinant-hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV4). It shows numbers of participants in each vaccine arm and exclusions for protocol criteria. The figure only outlines the study enrollment and randomization schema and provides no data or statements about viral mutations during vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim",
