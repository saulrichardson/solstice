  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (Log2 scale) on Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination against various vaccine viruses (cell-culture\u2013propagated, recombinant, and egg-propagated) for different influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Data are stratified by seven repeat vaccination arms (combinations of cell-based, recombinant, and egg-based quadrivalent vaccines) and two age groups, with geometric mean titers and 95% confidence intervals plotted, and p-values comparing the Fluzone (egg-based) arm to others. The figure presents HI antibody titers against differently propagated vaccine viruses but does not show or mention production-induced mutations; therefore, it does not support the claim of mutations arising during vaccine production that reduce effectiveness. Note: Limited to immunogenicity data; no direct genetic or antigenic mutation analyses are shown in the image.",
