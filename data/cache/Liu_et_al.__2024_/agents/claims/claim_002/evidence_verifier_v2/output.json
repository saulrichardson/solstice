It explicitly states that the manufacturing process (specifically for egg-based vaccines) can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein, which could alter antigenicity and result in differences in vaccine effectiveness.

      "explanation": "The quote 'Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.' appears verbatim in the document, near the beginning of the main text. The only differences are minor formatting/spacing, but the factual content and meaning are identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted (i.e., mutated during production) epitopes, and that this can reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses. This means that mutations arising during egg-based vaccine production can lead to immune responses that are less effective against the actual circulating strains, thus potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness. This is exactly what the claim asserts.",
