      "explanation": "The quote 'Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epi topes and reduce immuno- gen i city to circulating viruses.' appears almost verbatim on page 1 of the document. The only differences are minor spacing and line breaks, but the core content and meaning are identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted epitopes (mutations that arise during egg-based production) and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses. This means the immune response is focused on the mutated (egg-adapted) version rather than the actual circulating virus, which can reduce vaccine effectiveness. This is a direct mechanistic explanation of how mutations during production may reduce effectiveness, as the claim asserts.",
