The only differences are minor formatting/spacing, but the factual content and meaning are identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted (i.e., mutated during production) epitopes, and that this can reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses. This means that mutations arising during egg-based vaccine production can lead to immune responses that are less effective against the actual circulating strains, thus potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness.
