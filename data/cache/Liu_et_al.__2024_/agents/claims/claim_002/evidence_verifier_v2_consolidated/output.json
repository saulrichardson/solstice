The only differences are minor spacing and line breaks, but the core content and meaning are identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted epitopes (mutations that arise during egg-based production) and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses. This means the immune response is focused on the mutated (egg-adapted) version rather than the actual circulating virus, which can reduce vaccine effectiveness. This is a direct mechanistic explanation of how mutations during production may reduce effectiveness, as the claim asserts.",

It specifically describes an egg-adapted mutation (Q223R) in the HA head domain of A(H1N1)pdm09 that arises during egg-based vaccine production.

The quote describes the use of the 'GMT egg cell titer ratio' as a proxy to quantify differences in antibody responses to egg- versus cell-derived viruses. This difference arises because egg-based production can introduce mutations (egg-adapted changes) in the virus, leading to antigenic differences.

This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, and line breaks).. The quote directly supports the claim. It shows that egg-based vaccines reinforce immune responses to 'egg adapted epitopes,' which are the result of mutations that occur during egg-based production. The use of the 'GMT egg cell ratio \u22654' as a marker for antibodies targeting these egg-adapted epitopes demonstrates that such mutations are present and immunologically relevant. The fact that vaccination with egg-based vaccines increases the proportion of participants with this response suggests that the immune system is being directed toward these egg-adapted (i.e., mutated) forms, which may differ from the circulating strains, thus potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness.
