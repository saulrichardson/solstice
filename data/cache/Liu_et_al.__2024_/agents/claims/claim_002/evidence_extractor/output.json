      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that the manufacturing process for egg-based vaccines can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, which could result in altered vaccine effectiveness (VE), supporting the claim that mutations during production may reduce effectiveness."
