      "quote": "A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and punctuation: 'A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.' This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences (e.g., citation formatting, spacing).. The quote directly states that traditional split or subunit vaccines (which are cell- and egg-based) have the potential to acquire adaptive mutations during growth in eggs or mammalian cells during manufacture, and that these mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. This directly and explicitly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness."

      "quote": "Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg- adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glut amine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferen- tially over the circulating wild type virus 24.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and word breaks: 'Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg- adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glut amine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferen- tially over the circulating wild type virus 24.' This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences (e.g., line breaks, 'glut amine' instead of 'glutamine').. The quote provides a specific example of a mutation (glutamine to arginine at position 226) that arose during egg-based vaccine production, which led to antibodies that preferentially recognized the vaccine strain rather than the circulating wild type virus. This directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness, as the induced immune response was less effective against the circulating virus."

      "quote": "During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156 Q, G186 V, and S219 Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears almost verbatim in the document on page 2: 'During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156 Q, G186 V, and S219 Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.' The wording and content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the claim by providing a specific example where mutations (H156Q, G186V, S219Y) developed during egg-based vaccine production, and these mutations were attributed to a measurable reduction in vaccine effectiveness (41%) for H3N2 in the 2012-2013 season. This demonstrates that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness, thus substantiating the claim."

      "quote": "Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, in the section titled 'POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE.' The text states: 'Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.' This matches the quote to be verified, with only minor differences in formatting and citation style.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation during vaccine manufacturing have contributed to reduced vaccine effectiveness for H3N2 in multiple influenza seasons. This affirms the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness."

      "quote": "Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote 'Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26.' appears almost verbatim in the document. It is found in the section discussing the impact of egg- or cell-based vaccine production on antigenic match and effectiveness, specifically after a discussion of adaptive mutations and glycosylation differences (page 2-3).. The quote directly supports the claim. The surrounding context discusses how adaptive mutations and differences in HA glycosylation can arise during the production of flu vaccines in eggs or cells, and how these changes can reduce vaccine effectiveness. The quote specifically links differences in HA glycosylation (which can result from production-related mutations or adaptations) to reduced vaccine effectiveness, thus substantiating the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness."

      "quote": "the circulating A/H3 N2 viruses were antigenic ally similar to the cell grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of aglycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5, though it is split across two lines: 'the circulating A/H3 N2 viruses were antigenic ally similar to the cell grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of aglycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports 26.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor formatting and line breaks.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that egg propagation (a production method for flu vaccines) led to the loss of a glycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses. This is a specific example of a mutation (loss of glycosylation site) arising during vaccine production that reduces vaccine effectiveness (impaired antibody response), which is exactly what the claim asserts."
