      "quote": "The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus.",

      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document on page 2, with only minor differences in formatting and wording. The factual content is preserved: 'The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production.

Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus.' This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences (e.g., quotation marks, formatting).. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that there is a known risk of introducing adaptive (potentially deleterious) mutations in cell- and egg-based vaccine production, which can reduce vaccine effectiveness. It also notes that recombinant DNA technology avoids this risk because it does not use live virus, thus not subjecting the vaccine to egg- or cell-adapted mutations. The statement about stringent quality control lowering the risk today does not negate the existence of the risk; rather, it acknowledges it and describes mitigation efforts. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
