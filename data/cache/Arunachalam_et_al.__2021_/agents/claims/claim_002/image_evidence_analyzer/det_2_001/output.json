  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flow chart illustrating the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system for manufacturing a recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4). It shows steps including full-length cDNA cloning into baculovirus DNA, recombination to generate HA expression vectors, insect cell seeding and expansion in a bioreactor, virus harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration for clarification, capture and purification including DNA removal, and final tangential flow filtration/formulation. The image depicts the production process of a recombinant HA vaccine using a baculovirus-insect cell system and does not mention or show any development of mutations in cell- or egg-based vaccine production. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The figure does not reference mutation events or their impact on vaccine effectiveness; only the production workflow is shown.",
