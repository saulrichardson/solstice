  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flow diagram illustrating the production of hemagglutinin (HA) using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system for manufacturing RIV4. It shows steps including direct cloning of HA gene into a baculovirus expression vector under a polyhedrin promoter, cell seeding and infection in bioreactors, disc-stack centrifugation harvest, extraction, depth filtration clarification, capture and purification steps (including DNA removal), followed by TFF/formulation. The image describes a recombinant insect cell\u2013based HA production process and contains no information about mutations arising during cell- or egg-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim Note: None",
