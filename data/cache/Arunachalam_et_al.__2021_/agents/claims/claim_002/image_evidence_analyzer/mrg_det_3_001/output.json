  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two schematic panels comparing structural features of influenza haemagglutinin (HA) protein: panel a shows native HA1/HA2 heterodimer from virus with cleaved fusion peptide and complex sialylated N-linked glycans, panel b shows recombinant HA0 precursor expressed in insect cells with uncleaved fusion-peptide loop and simpler paucimannose glycans. The figure describes glycosylation and cleavage differences of HA produced in insect cells versus virus-derived HA but does not mention cell- or egg-based vaccine production mutations or their effect on vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: Figure focuses on insect cell\u2013produced HA; egg-based production and mutation data are not presented.",
