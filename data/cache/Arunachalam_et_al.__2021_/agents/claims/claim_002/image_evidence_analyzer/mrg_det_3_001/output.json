  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-panel schematic showing structural features of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) proteins: (a) native HA extracted from influenza virus, depicted as HA1 and HA2 subunits linked by an inter-disulfide bond with polysiaylated complex N-linked glycans and a cleaved fusion peptide; (b) recombinant HA (rHA) produced in insect cells via baculovirus expression, shown as an uncleaved HA0 precursor with paucimannose N-linked glycans and an uncleaved fusion-peptide loop. does not support the claim because the image illustrates differences in glycosylation and cleavage between native viral HA and recombinant insect-cell HA but provides no data on mutations arising during cell- or egg-based vaccine production that could reduce effectiveness. Note: The figure focuses on glycan structure and cleavage state of HA, not genetic mutations; image quality is sufficient to see labels and annotations.",
