      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that circulates in the community is eliminated.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that the recombinant process used for Flublok (RIV4) ensures the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus selected for the vaccine, eliminating the risk of antigenic mismatch with the WHO- and FDA-selected strains."

      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes the manufacturing process of Flublok, emphasizing that the HA antigens are produced recombinantly and are not subject to the adaptive mutations that can occur in egg- or cell-based production, supporting the claim of an identical antigenic match."
