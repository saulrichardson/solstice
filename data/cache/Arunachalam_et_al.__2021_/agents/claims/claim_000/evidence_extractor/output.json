      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufactur- ing process as it does not use \u2018live\u2019 influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculo virus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type influenza strain selected for vaccines is eli min",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that the recombinant HA (as used in Flublok) is produced from DNA cloned from the reference virus and confirmed for fidelity, ensuring the primary amino acid sequence is identical to the wild type virus selected for the vaccine. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that Flublok (RIV4) is made using recombinant technology, which is key to avoiding the adaptive mutations that can occur in traditional egg- or cell-based manufacturing, thus supporting the claim of an identical antigenic match."
