  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Schematic diagrams (panels a and b) of hemagglutinin (HA) protein: panel a shows native HA extracted from influenza virus as HA1 and HA2 heterodimer with complex-type sialylated N-linked glycans and cleaved fusion peptide; panel b shows recombinant HA0 produced in insect cells as a single precursor polypeptide with amino acid sequence identical to wild-type HA and bearing paucimannose N-linked glycans and an uncleaved fusion-peptide loop. This figure does not support the claim because it only presents the structural and sequence features of HA and differences in glycosylation between native and insect-cell\u2013expressed proteins, without any data or statements demonstrating that Flublok antigens are an identical antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains. Note: The figure focuses on molecular structure and glycosylation; it does not reference specific flu strains or regulatory matching criteria.",
