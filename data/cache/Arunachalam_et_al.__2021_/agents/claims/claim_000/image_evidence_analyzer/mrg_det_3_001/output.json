  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two schematic diagrams labeled a and b depicting structural features of native influenza HA (heterodimer of HA1 and HA2 with complex-type glycans and cleaved fusion peptide) versus recombinant HA (HA0 monomer with paucimannose glycans and uncleaved fusion peptide) produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression. The figure illustrates structural and glycosylation differences between native HA and recombinant HA produced in insect cells but does not provide any information on HA antigen content or dosage comparisons, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but focuses solely on protein structure and glycan composition, not antigen amounts or immunogenicity.",
