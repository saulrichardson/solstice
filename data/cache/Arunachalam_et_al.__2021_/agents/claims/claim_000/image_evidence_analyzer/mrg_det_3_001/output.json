  "explanation": "Schematic figure comparing structural features of native influenza hemagglutinin (HA) extracted from virus (panel a) and recombinant HA produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system (panel b). Panel a shows HA1 (turquoise) and HA2 (orange) as a heterodimer with complex-type sialylated N-linked glycans, cleaved fusion peptide (green), inter-disulfide bond, membrane anchor, and internal C-terminus. Panel b shows recombinant HA as a single precursor polypeptide (HA0) with identical amino acid sequence to wildtype, simpler paucimannose N-linked glycans, uncleaved fusion peptide loop (green), disulfide bond, membrane anchor, and internal C-terminus. The figure focuses on structural and glycosylation differences between native and recombinant HA proteins and does not address matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to visible schematic without accompanying text on strain matching; no evidence of antigenic match data or reference to Flublok\u2019s strain selection process.",
