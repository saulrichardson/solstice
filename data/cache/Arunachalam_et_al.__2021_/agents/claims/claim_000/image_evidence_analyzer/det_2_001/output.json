  "explanation": "Flowchart illustrating the production of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system for the manufacture of RIV4. It shows steps including cloning the HA gene into a baculovirus vector under a polyhedrin promoter, infecting insect cells, expansion in a bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration for clarification, chromatographic capture and purification, DNA removal, and final tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure only outlines the recombinant HA manufacturing workflow and does not present any data or statements regarding antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected strains; therefore it does not support the claim.",
