  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Schematic diagram showing the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system workflow for manufacturing recombinant influenza HA: from HA gene cloning and recombination into baculovirus DNA, through insect cell seeding, virus infection, bioreactor expansion, harvest, extraction, depth filtration, capture, purification (including DNA removal), and final TFF/formulation steps. The figure does not support the claim because it only depicts the manufacturing process for recombinant HA antigen and contains no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains or any statement about Flublok ensuring identical antigenic match. Note: Image quality is sufficient; no data on strain matching or regulatory selection is presented.",
