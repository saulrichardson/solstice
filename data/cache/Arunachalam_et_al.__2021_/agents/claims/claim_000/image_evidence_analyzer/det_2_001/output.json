  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flow diagram depicting the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system used to manufacture RIV4 (Flublok), showing steps: cloning of full-length HA cDNA into a baculovirus vector, viral infection of insect cells in a bioreactor, harvest via disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration clarification, chromatographic capture and purification (including DNA removal), and tangential flow filtration (TFF)/formulation. does not support the claim: the figure only outlines the production process of Flublok and provides no information on HA antigen content or comparative dosage versus standard-dose flu vaccines.",
