  "explanation": "A flowchart diagram illustrating the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system for manufacturing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine (RIV4), showing steps such as direct cloning of HA gene into baculovirus vector, recombination, insect cell seeding, bioreactor expansion, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, clarification, capture, purification, DNA removal, and tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure only depicts the manufacturing process of recombinant HA in insect cells and does not present any data or statements regarding antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, and therefore does not support the claim.",
