      "quote": "The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and purified from the clarified cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane filtration. Purified rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential flow filtration and passed through sterile filtration for storage and formulation 22.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes the manufacturing process of Flublok (RIV4), emphasizing that the HA genes used are directly from the selected influenza strains, supporting the claim that the antigenic match is ensured with the WHO- and FDA-selected strains.",

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that recombinant HA (as used in Flublok) preserves antigenic sites present in the selected wild-type strains, supporting the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with the strains chosen by health authorities.",
