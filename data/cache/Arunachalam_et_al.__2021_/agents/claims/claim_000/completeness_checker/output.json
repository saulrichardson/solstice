      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufactur- ing process as it does not use \u2018live\u2019 influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculo virus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type influenza strain selected for vaccines is eli min",

The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor formatting and line break differences.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that recombinant DNA technology (as used in Flublok/RIV4) avoids adaptive mutations that can occur in egg- or cell-based manufacturing, and that the DNA coding for HA is cloned from the reference virus and confirmed for fidelity. It further states that the primary amino acid sequence of the recombinant HA is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for vaccine production. This means the antigenic match is identical to the WHO- and FDA-selected strains, directly supporting the claim.",

      "explanation": "A nearly identical quote appears on page 6: 'The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.' The wording is almost exactly the same as the quote to verify, with only minor differences in phrasing and punctuation.. The quote directly states that recombinant protein technology (as used in Flublok) eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch caused by changes in the HA structure during egg or cell adaptation, which are issues in traditional vaccine production. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it implies the antigen in Flublok matches the selected strains without the risk of mismatch introduced by adaptation in eggs or cells.",
