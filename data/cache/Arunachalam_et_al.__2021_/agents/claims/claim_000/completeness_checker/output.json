      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus is eliminated.",

      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document on page 2, with only minor formatting and wording differences. The factual content is preserved: 'Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus.

Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus is eliminated.' The meaning and technical content are equivalent to the quote provided.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the primary amino acid sequence of the HA antigen is identical to that of the wild type virus isolate selected for vaccine production, and that this process eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch. This means Flublok's HA antigen is an identical match to the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as those are the reference wild type viruses used for vaccine strain selection. No inference is required; the support is explicit.",
