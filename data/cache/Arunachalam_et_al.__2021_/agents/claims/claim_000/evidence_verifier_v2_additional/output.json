      "explanation": "The quote appears almost verbatim on page 2: 'As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculo virus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote directly states that the recombinant HA (rHA) produced for vaccines like Flublok (which uses a baculovirus expression system) is identical in its primary amino acid sequence to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for vaccine production. Since the WHO and FDA select the wild type strains for seasonal influenza vaccines, this means Flublok's antigenic component is an identical match to those strains, supporting the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor wording differences: 'Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28.' This matches the quote to verify almost exactly, with only trivial differences in punctuation and formatting.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that the HA gene used in Flublok (RIV4) is cloned from a reference virus published in the GISAID database (which is the source for WHO- and FDA-selected strains) and that the fidelity of this sequence is confirmed at the working virus bank level. This means the antigen produced is genetically identical to the selected reference strain, ensuring an identical antigenic match with the strains chosen by WHO and FDA. The context further clarifies that this process avoids adaptive mutations that can occur in egg- or cell-based production, reinforcing the claim.",
