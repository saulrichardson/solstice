      "explanation": "The quote 'The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.' appears in the document, near the end of page 6. The wording is an exact match, and the context is about the advantages of recombinant protein technology (as used in Flublok/RIV4) over traditional egg- or cell-based vaccine production.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant protein technology (used in Flublok) eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch caused by changes in the HA structure during egg or cell adaptation. This means the antigen produced matches the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as there is no opportunity for adaptation-induced changes. The document further explains that the primary amino acid sequence of the recombinant HA is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for vaccine production, reinforcing the claim.",
