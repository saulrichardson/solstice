RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.' The factual content, including the product names, the recombinant nature, and the 45 \u00b5g HA per strain, is preserved and matches the quote to verify.. The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain. Standard-dose flu vaccines are known to contain 15 \u00b5g HA per strain (this is not stated in the quote or document, but the quote provides the 45 \u00b5g figure for Flublok, which is the key fact in the claim). The claim also asserts that this higher antigen content has been linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. While the quote does not explicitly mention immunogenicity, it provides the critical factual support for the first part of the claim (the 3x antigen content). The document elsewhere (page 5) discusses that RIV4 elicits higher T-cell and antibody responses than standard vaccines, supporting the link to greater immunogenicity. Therefore, the quote, in the context of the document, genuinely supports the claim.",

The wording and factual content match the quote to verify.. The quote explicitly states that the standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quadrivalent) is given at 15 \u00b5g HA per strain. This directly supports the part of the claim that standard-dose flu vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g HA per strain, which is necessary to establish that Flublok's 45 \u00b5g HA per strain is 3x higher. However, the quote does not mention Flublok or its HA content, nor does it address immunogenicity or efficacy differences between Flublok and standard-dose vaccines. It only provides the comparator dose (15 \u00b5g/strain) for standard vaccines, which is a factual basis for the claim's comparison. Thus, it supports the claim in terms of establishing the standard-dose HA content, but not the full claim regarding Flublok's immunogenicity advantage.",
