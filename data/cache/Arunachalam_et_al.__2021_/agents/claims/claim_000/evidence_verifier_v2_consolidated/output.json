The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor formatting and line break differences.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that recombinant DNA technology (as used in Flublok/RIV4) avoids adaptive mutations that can occur in egg- or cell-based manufacturing, and that the DNA coding for HA is cloned from the reference virus and confirmed for fidelity. It further states that the primary amino acid sequence of the recombinant HA is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for vaccine production. This means the antigenic match is identical to the WHO- and FDA-selected strains, directly supporting the claim.",
