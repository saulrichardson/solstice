      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that circulates in the community is eliminated.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document on page 2, with only minor formatting and wording differences due to OCR correction. The factual content is preserved: it states that recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of egg- or cell-adapted mutations, uses DNA coding for HA cloned from a reference virus in the GISAID database, confirms fidelity at the working virus bank level, and that the primary amino acid sequence of rHA produced is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for vaccine production. It concludes that the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4 (Flublok) with the wild type flu virus is eliminated.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production, and that this eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch. Since the WHO and FDA select the reference strains for seasonal influenza vaccines, this means Flublok's antigenic match is identical to those selected strains, as claimed.",

      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 6 of the document: 'The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.' This matches the provided quote in both meaning and technical content, with only minor differences in formatting and punctuation.. The quote directly states that recombinant protein technology (as used in Flublok) eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch caused by changes in the HA structure during egg or cell adaptation, which are issues in traditional vaccine production. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it implies the antigen in Flublok remains unchanged from the selected reference strain.",
