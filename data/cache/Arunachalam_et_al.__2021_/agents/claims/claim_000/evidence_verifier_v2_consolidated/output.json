      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that circulates in the community is eliminated.",

The meaning and technical content are equivalent to the quote provided.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production, and that the risk of antigenic mismatch is eliminated. This means Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with the strains selected by WHO and FDA, as those are the reference wild type viruses used for vaccine production. No inference is required; the support is explicit.",

The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. It explicitly states that recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to changes in HA structure that can occur during egg or cell adaptation, which is a problem in traditional vaccine production.
