  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",

      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'una djuv anted' instead of 'unadjuvanted'). The technical content and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose per strain. Standard-dose flu vaccines are known to contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per strain, so this is three times the amount. This directly supports the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Still, since the claim is twofold and the quote substantiates the first (antigen content) with explicit numbers, it supports the claim as far as the quote is concerned."

      "quote": "Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document: 'Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.' The factual content, technical terms, and meaning are preserved, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) elicits higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody responses against HA1 compared to standard-dose split vaccines derived from eggs or mammalian cells. This supports the claim that Flublok's higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. The quote also references the need for further studies to determine if this broader antibody response underlies observed cross-protection, which aligns with the claim's focus on immunogenicity."
