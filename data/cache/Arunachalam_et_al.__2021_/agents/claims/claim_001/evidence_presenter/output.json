      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.' The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'unadjuvanted' vs 'unadjuvanted', '\u00b5g' vs '\u00b5g', etc.). All key facts and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines. This substantiates the first part of the claim. While the quote does not explicitly state that this higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity, the document elsewhere discusses improved immunogenicity of RIV4 compared to standard-dose vaccines. However, for the purposes of this verification, the quote itself provides explicit support for the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines."

      "quote": "Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor formatting differences: 'Higher magnitudes of haem agglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flu cel vax Tetra, Seq i rus, and Flu zone quad rival ent SD, San of i Pasteur 60.)'. The content and meaning are preserved, including the comparison of RIV4 (Flublok) to standard-dose vaccines and the observation of higher antibody responses.. The quote directly supports the claim by stating that RIV4 (Flublok) elicits higher magnitudes of hemagglutination inhibitory antibody responses against HA1 compared to standard-dose egg- or cell-derived split vaccines. This is direct evidence of greater immunogenicity. While the quote does not explicitly mention the 3x HA content, it does link RIV4 to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose vaccines, which is the core of the claim."
