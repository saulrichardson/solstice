      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor formatting and spacing differences. The factual content is preserved: 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.'. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines. This substantiates the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. While the quote does not explicitly mention greater immunogenicity, the claim's first part is fully supported by the explicit numbers provided in the quote. The document elsewhere discusses immunogenicity, but for this quote, the support is for the antigen content comparison."

      "quote": "Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and punctuation. The relevant passage is: 'Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines.' This matches the quoted content in meaning and technical detail.. The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (RIV4) is linked to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines. It describes a study in which RIV4 produced significantly higher T-cell and antibody responses than both egg-derived and cell-derived split vaccines over three influenza seasons. While the quote does not explicitly mention the 3x HA antigen content, it does provide direct evidence of greater immunogenicity, which is the key point of the claim."

      "quote": "Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and punctuation: 'Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60).' The factual content, technical terms, and vaccine names are all preserved and semantically equivalent.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) elicits higher magnitudes of hemagglutination inhibitory antibody responses against HA1 compared to standard-dose egg- or cell-derived split vaccines. This supports the claim that Flublok's higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines, as the quote provides explicit comparative immunogenicity data. While the quote does not mention the '3x' HA content, it does substantiate the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity."
