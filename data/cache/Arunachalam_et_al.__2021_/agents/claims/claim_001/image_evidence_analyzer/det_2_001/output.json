  "claim_id": "claim_001",
  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-step flowchart illustrating the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system used to produce recombinant HA for a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). The diagram shows cloning of full-length HA cDNA into a baculovirus vector, infection of insect cells in bioreactors, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration, capture and purification steps (including DNA removal), and final tangential flow filtration/formulation. A citation to J Invertebr Pathol is included. The figure details the manufacturing workflow of HA in insect cells but provides no quantitative information on HA antigen content or comparative immunogenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim that Flublok contains 3\u00d7 the HA antigen of standard-dose vaccines. Note: The image is clear but focuses solely on production steps; no dosage or immunogenicity data are presented.",
