  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010step process flow diagram illustrating the baculovirus\u2010insect cell expression system for manufacturing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine (RIV4), including cloning of HA gene into baculovirus vector, infection of insect cells, cell expansion in bioreactor, harvest, extraction, depth filtration, capture, purification, DNA removal, and formulation. The figure does not support the claim because it only depicts the manufacturing workflow for recombinant HA and contains no quantitative data on HA antigen content or comparisons to standard\u2010dose vaccines.",
