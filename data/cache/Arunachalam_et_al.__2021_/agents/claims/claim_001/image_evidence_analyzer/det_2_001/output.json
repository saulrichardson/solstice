  "claim_id": "claim_001",
  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flowchart illustrating the manufacture of HA using the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system for RIV4. It shows steps including full\u2010length cDNA cloning, recombination into a baculovirus vector, insect cell seeding and bioreactor expansion, disc\u2010stack centrifugation harvest, extraction, depth filtration clarification, capture, purification with DNA removal, and final TFF/formulation. The figure only outlines the production process for recombinant HA and provides no data on HA antigen amounts or comparisons to standard\u2010dose vaccines; it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to a process schematic; no quantitative or immunogenicity information is presented.",
