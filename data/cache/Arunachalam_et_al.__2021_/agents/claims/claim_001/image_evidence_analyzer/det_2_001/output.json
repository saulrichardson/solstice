  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic diagram illustrating the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system used to produce hemagglutinin (HA) for the RIV4 vaccine, including cloning of the HA gene into baculovirus DNA, infection and expansion in bioreactors, harvest, extraction, filtration, capture, purification, DNA removal, and formulation steps. does not support the claim because the figure only depicts the manufacturing process of HA in insect cells and contains no data or statements regarding HA antigen content or comparative dosing versus standard-dose flu vaccines Note: Image quality is sufficient to discern content; no relevant quantitative information on HA antigen levels is present",
