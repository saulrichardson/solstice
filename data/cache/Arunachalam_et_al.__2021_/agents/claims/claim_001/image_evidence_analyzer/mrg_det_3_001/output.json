  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A composite figure showing schematic structural features of native influenza hemagglutinin (HA) expressed on virus (HA1 and HA2 heterodimer, with complex sialylated N-linked glycans and cleaved fusion peptide) versus recombinant HA (HA0 precursor monomer produced in insect cells with simpler paucimannose glycans and an uncleaved fusion peptide loop). The figure only depicts molecular structural differences (glycosylation patterns and cleavage status) between native and recombinant HA and provides no information on antigen dosage or immunogenicity. It does not support the claim.",
