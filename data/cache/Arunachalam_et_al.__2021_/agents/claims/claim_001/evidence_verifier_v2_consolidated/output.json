The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines. This substantiates the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. While the quote does not explicitly mention greater immunogenicity, the claim's first part is fully supported by the explicit numbers provided in the quote. The document elsewhere discusses immunogenicity, but for this quote, the support is for the antigen content comparison.",
