This matches the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and word order (e.g., 'an unadjuvanted vaccine' instead of 'unadjuvanted vaccine').. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, and since standard-dose flu vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per strain, this is three times the amount. This fact substantiates the first part of the claim. The document also discusses that higher HA content and unique features of RIV4 are linked to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines, supporting the second part of the claim.",

The wording and content match the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing and hyphenation (e.g., 'quad rival ent' instead of 'quadrivalent'). The essential information is present: QIV (Fluarix Quadrivalent) is given at 15 \u00b5g HA per strain.. The quote directly states that the standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quadrivalent) is given at 15 \u00b5g HA per strain. This supports the claim by establishing the HA content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which can then be compared to Flublok's 45 \u00b5g per strain (as described elsewhere in the document). This substantiates the '3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content' part of the claim. The document also discusses greater immunogenicity of Flublok elsewhere, so this quote is relevant and supportive for the claim as stated.",
