This substantiates the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. While the quote does not explicitly mention greater immunogenicity, the claim's first part is fully supported by the explicit numbers provided in the quote. The document elsewhere discusses immunogenicity, but for this quote, the support is for the antigen content comparison.",
