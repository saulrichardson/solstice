All key facts and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines. This substantiates the first part of the claim. While the quote does not explicitly state that this higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity, the document elsewhere discusses improved immunogenicity of RIV4 compared to standard-dose vaccines.
