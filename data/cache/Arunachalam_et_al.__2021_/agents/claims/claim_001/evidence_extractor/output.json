      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim."

      "quote": "Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60). These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that RIV4 (Flublok) elicits higher antibody responses compared to standard-dose flu vaccines, supporting the link between higher HA content and greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote affirms that RIV4 (Flublok) produces significantly higher immune responses than standard-dose vaccines, supporting the claim that its formulation (including higher HA content) is linked to greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence from a referenced study that the recombinant HA in RIV4 (Flublok) induces higher levels of cross-reactive antibodies than standard-dose (egg-derived) vaccines, supporting the claim of greater immunogenicity."
