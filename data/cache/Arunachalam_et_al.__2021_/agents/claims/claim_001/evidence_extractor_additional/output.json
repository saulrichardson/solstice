The rHA contained in RIV4 differs from that expressed in other systems in terms of specific structural features, the nature of the source material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on certain aspects of vaccine safety and efficacy (Fig. 2).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote highlights that RIV4 (Flublok) is distinct from other vaccines in its composition and manufacturing, which is relevant to the claim that it contains a higher HA antigen content and has different immunogenic properties.",
