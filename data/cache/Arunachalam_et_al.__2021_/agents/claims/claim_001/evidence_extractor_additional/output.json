      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides a direct comparison of antigen content per strain (30 \u00b5g vs 15 \u00b5g) and shows that higher HA content is associated with at least non-inferior efficacy, supporting the link between increased HA dose and immunogenicity. It also contextualizes the standard-dose (15 \u00b5g) used in conventional vaccines.",

      "quote": "Insect cell derived rHA (RIV4) has been studied extensively by various groups in both pre clinical models and humans. The rHA contained in RIV4 differs from that expressed in other systems in terms of specific structural features, the nature of the source material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on certain aspects of vaccine safety and efficacy (Fig. 2). Based on these unique features RIV4 received 'product exclusivity' protection.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote highlights that RIV4 (Flublok) is distinct in its composition and manufacturing, which impacts efficacy, supporting the claim that its higher HA content and unique features are linked to improved immunogenicity.",

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) elicits higher antibody responses than standard-dose vaccines, supporting the link between its higher HA content and greater immunogenicity.",
