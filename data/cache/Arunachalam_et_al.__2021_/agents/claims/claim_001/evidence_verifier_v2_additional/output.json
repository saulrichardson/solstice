      "explanation": "A very close version of the quote appears on page 5: 'Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65.

Authors postulated that simpler glycosyla- tion of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and line breaks.. The quote directly supports the part of the claim that RIV4 (Flublok) is linked to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines, as it states that RIV4 elicited 'significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines' (which are standard-dose, egg- and cell-derived split vaccines). It also discusses possible reasons for this increased immunogenicity. However, the quote does not mention the 3x HA antigen content or directly link the higher antigen content to the greater immunogenicity. It only supports the immunogenicity comparison, not the antigen content aspect. Thus, it partially but genuinely supports the claim as written.",

This matches the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and formatting.. The quote directly compares the immune response (geometric mean fold rise) after vaccination with RIV4 (Flublok) to that of high-dose and adjuvanted standard vaccines, showing that RIV4 elicits a higher response. This supports the claim that Flublok is linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines.
