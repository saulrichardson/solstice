      "quote": "A plant derived recombinant quadrivalent VLP (QVLP) at 30 \u00b5g dose per strain was found to be non inferior in terms of vaccine efficacy against respiratory illness and influenza like illness to a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quadrivalent, GlaxoSmithKline) given at 15 \u00b5g dose strain in adults aged 18 to 64 years 37.",
      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote provides a direct comparison of antigen content per strain (30 \u00b5g vs 15 \u00b5g) and shows that higher HA content is associated with at least non-inferior efficacy, supporting the link between increased HA dose and immunogenicity. While not about Flublok specifically, it supports the general principle that higher HA content (as in Flublok) is linked to greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "The resulting processed proteins are less immunogenic than egg derived antigens, with around a 10 fold greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in animal models 31. These inherent complications have prevented large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of E. coli expressed influenza vaccines.",
      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by highlighting that the amount of HA antigen is directly related to immunogenicity, as a higher quantity is needed to achieve protection when immunogenicity is lower. This underlines the importance of HA content in vaccine efficacy."
