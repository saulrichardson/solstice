      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and punctuation: 'Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60).' The factual content, technical terms, and vaccine names are all preserved and semantically equivalent.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) elicits higher magnitudes of hemagglutination inhibitory antibody responses against HA1 compared to standard-dose egg- or cell-derived split vaccines. This supports the claim that Flublok's higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines, as the quote provides explicit comparative immunogenicity data. While the quote does not mention the '3x' HA content, it does substantiate the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity.",

      "original_explanation": "This quote provides a direct comparison of antigen content per strain (30 \u00b5g vs 15 \u00b5g) and shows that higher HA content is associated with at least non-inferior efficacy, supporting the link between increased HA dose and immunogenicity. It also contextualizes the standard-dose (15 \u00b5g) used in conventional vaccines."

      "quote": "Insect cell derived rHA (RIV4) has been studied extensively by various groups in both pre clinical models and humans. The rHA contained in RIV4 differs from that expressed in other systems in terms of specific structural features, the nature of the source material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on certain aspects of vaccine safety and efficacy (Fig. 2). Based on these unique features RIV4 received 'product exclusivity' protection.",

      "original_explanation": "This quote highlights that RIV4 (Flublok) is distinct in its composition and manufacturing, which impacts efficacy, supporting the claim that its higher HA content and unique features are linked to improved immunogenicity."
