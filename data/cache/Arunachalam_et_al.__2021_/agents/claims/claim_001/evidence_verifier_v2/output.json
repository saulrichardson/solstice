The factual content is preserved: 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.'. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines. This substantiates the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. While the quote does not explicitly mention greater immunogenicity, the claim's first part is fully supported by the explicit numbers provided in the quote. The document elsewhere discusses immunogenicity, but for this quote, the support is for the antigen content comparison.",

It describes a study in which RIV4 produced significantly higher T-cell and antibody responses than both egg-derived and cell-derived split vaccines over three influenza seasons. While the quote does not explicitly mention the 3x HA antigen content, it does provide direct evidence of greater immunogenicity, which is the key point of the claim.",
