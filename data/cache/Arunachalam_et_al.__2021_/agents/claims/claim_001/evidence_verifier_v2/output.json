      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.' The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'unadjuvanted' vs 'unadjuvanted', '\u00b5g' vs '\u00b5g', etc.). All key facts and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines. This substantiates the first part of the claim. While the quote does not explicitly state that this higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity, the document elsewhere discusses improved immunogenicity of RIV4 compared to standard-dose vaccines. However, for the purposes of this verification, the quote itself provides explicit support for the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines.",
