      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'una djuv anted' instead of 'unadjuvanted'). The technical content and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose per strain. Standard-dose flu vaccines are known to contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per strain, so this is three times the amount. This directly supports the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Still, since the claim is twofold and the quote substantiates the first (antigen content) with explicit numbers, it supports the claim as far as the quote is concerned.",
