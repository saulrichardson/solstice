  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flow diagram illustrating the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system for manufacture of RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine), showing steps from cloning of the HA gene into a baculovirus vector, infection and expansion in insect cell bioreactors, harvest, extraction, clarification, capture, purification, and formulation. does not support the claim because the figure only depicts the manufacturing workflow for recombinant HA production and contains no information on HA microgram dosages per strain in vaccine formulations Note: No numerical dosage information is present in the image; text is clear and complete for the manufacturing process but does not address HA content per dose.",
