Beneath the figure is a partial text snippet referencing a quadrivalent inactivated vaccine trial using Fluarix Quadrivalent in adults aged 18\u201364. does not support the claim because the image and its accompanying text describe the manufacturing process and mention Fluarix Quadrivalent but contain no evaluation of Flublok (quadrivalent) against Fluarix. Note: Text is partially cut off and no mention of Flublok is visible in the image.",
