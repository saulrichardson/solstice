  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic diagram showing the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system for manufacturing a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) with steps for cloning, cell seeding, expansion, harvest, extraction, clarification, capture, purification, DNA removal, and formulation. Below the figure is partial text mentioning a quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent, GlaxoSmithKline) and aspects of VLP immunogenicity. The figure and accompanying text describe the manufacturing process for a recombinant influenza vaccine and mention Fluarix Quadrivalent but do not present any data or statements indicating that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix in a pivotal trial; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The bottom text is partially cut off, but no mention of a pivotal trial comparing Flublok to Fluarix is visible.",
