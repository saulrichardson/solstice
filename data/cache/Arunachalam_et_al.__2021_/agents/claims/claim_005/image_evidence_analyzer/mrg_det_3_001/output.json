  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-part schematic depicting structural features of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) proteins: panel a shows native HA extracted from influenza virus as a heterodimer (HA1 in turquoise and HA2 in orange) with complex-type sialylated N-linked glycans and cleaved fusion peptide; panel b shows recombinant HA (rHA) expressed in insect cells as a single precursor polypeptide (HA0) with paucimannose glycans, an uncleaved fusion peptide loop, and disulfide bond, plus explanatory labels and glycan icons. does not support the claim because the figure illustrates structural features of HA proteins and does not present any clinical trial comparison between Flublok quadrivalent and Fluarix quadrivalent vaccines Note: The image focuses on protein structure and glycosylation; it contains no trial data or vaccine names related to the claim",
