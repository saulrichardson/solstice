      "explanation": "A very close version of the quote appears on page 5: 'Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65.

Authors postulated that simpler glycosyla- tion of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and line breaks.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) elicited the most robust immune responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than conventional vaccines. It also notes that the unique features of recombinant technology (simpler glycosylation, absence of other viral proteins) are relevant for vaccine efficacy and long-term immunity. While it does not explicitly mention 'broader immune response' or 'cross-protection in a mismatch season,' the robust and higher immune responses, as well as the emphasis on long-term immunity, are prerequisites for broader and potentially cross-protective immunity. This provides direct support for the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
