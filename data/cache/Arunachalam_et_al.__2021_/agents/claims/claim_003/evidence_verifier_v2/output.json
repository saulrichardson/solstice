The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant technology (RIV4) induces significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies (which implies a broader immune response) and more robust T-cell and antibody responses than conventional vaccines. It also mentions that these responses are against highly conserved regions, which is the mechanistic basis for cross-protection, even in the case of antigenic mismatch. The reference to three successive influenza seasons further supports the relevance to mismatch seasons. Therefore, the quote provides direct and specific evidence for the claim.",

      "quote": "RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, SanofiPasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of aglycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports 26.",
