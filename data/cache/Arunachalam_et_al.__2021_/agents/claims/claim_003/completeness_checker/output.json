The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and line breaks.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) elicited the most robust immune responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than conventional vaccines. It also notes that the unique features of recombinant technology (simpler glycosylation, absence of other viral proteins) are relevant for vaccine efficacy and long-term immunity. While it does not explicitly mention 'broader immune response' or 'cross-protection in a mismatch season,' the robust and higher immune responses, as well as the emphasis on long-term immunity, are prerequisites for broader and potentially cross-protective immunity. This provides direct support for the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

During the 2014-2015 influenza season, a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain possessing anew predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26. For the 2016-2017 season the influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26. However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg adapted virus. Consequently, anti- bodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26. Contrary to the egg- derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that efficiently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 virus 26.",
