      "quote": "Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26. During the 2014-2015 influenza season, a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain possessing anew predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26. For the 2016-2017 season the influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26. However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg adapted virus. Consequently, anti- bodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26. Contrary to the egg- derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that efficiently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 virus 26.",

The wording and content are nearly identical to the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It describes how recombinant HA (rHA) vaccines, such as RIV4, can induce antibodies that efficiently recognize a drifted (glycosylated) H3N2 strain, whereas egg-derived vaccines do not. This demonstrates that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, because the rHA vaccine matches the wild-type virus more closely and elicits antibodies that neutralize drifted strains.",
