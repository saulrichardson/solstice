      "quote": "The evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional approaches. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process impurities such as inactivating agents or residual egg protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza and or COVID-19.",

      "quote": "The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions could provide broader specificity. Antisera raised against simple monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine induced protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76-79.

      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus is eliminated.",
