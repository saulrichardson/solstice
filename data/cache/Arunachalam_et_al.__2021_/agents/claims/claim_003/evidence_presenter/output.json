      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording due to OCR correction, but all key facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved. The passage states: 'clearly demonstrate structural differences between HA pre fusion and post fusion states, and the presence of unique neutralising epitopes in the pre fusion HA0 molecules, which are present in RIV4 (Fig. 2).

The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant technology (RIV4) induces significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies (which implies a broader immune response) and more robust T-cell and antibody responses than conventional vaccines. It also mentions that these responses are against highly conserved regions, which is the mechanistic basis for cross-protection, even in the case of antigenic mismatch. The reference to three successive influenza seasons further supports the relevance to mismatch seasons. Therefore, the quote provides direct and specific evidence for the claim."

      "quote": "RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, SanofiPasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of aglycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording (e.g., 'antigenically' vs 'antigenic ally', 'post vaccination' vs 'post vaccination', and some punctuation/spacing differences). All key facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved: the study by Belongia et al., the comparison of RIV4, HD-IIV3, and aIIV3 in adults 65-74, the testing against four A/H3N2 viruses (including drifted strains), the geometric mean fold rise being twice as high for RIV4, the low but similar post-vaccination titres for drifted strains, the strong association of RIV4 with seroconversion (p = 0.003), and the investigators' suggestion about egg propagation and impaired antibody response. The semantic content is fully equivalent.. The quote directly supports the claim. It describes a clinical study showing that RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) induces a broader, cross-reactive antibody response to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans, with higher seroconversion rates to drifted strains compared to conventional vaccines. This demonstrates that recombinant technology can lead to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection, even in seasons where there is a mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains."

      "quote": "In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutralising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording (e.g., 'haem agglutinin' instead of 'haemagglutinin', 'Flucelvax [Trivalent]' instead of 'Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77', and some reference numbers are formatted differently). The factual content, including the study by Nachbagauer et al., the induction of HA stem-specific neutralising antibodies by RIV4, the age-dependent response, the comparison to traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccines, and the observation of higher haemagglutination inhibitory antibody responses, is all present and semantically equivalent to the quote provided.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides explicit evidence that recombinant technology (RIV4) induces a broader immune response, including both HA stem and head-specific antibodies, and at higher magnitudes than conventional vaccines. It also notes that these responses are observed across influenza subtypes and in both humans and mice, with the highest titres in the elderly. The quote further states that these findings warrant studies to verify if rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire and if this underlies the cross-protection against antigenic drift variants observed in clinical trials. This directly addresses the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season."

      "quote": "The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross protection against mismatched influenza strains 12 75. The study by Nachbagauer et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent influenza viruses similar to the multiple A/H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82. Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against influenza.",

We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process impurities such as inactivating agents or residual egg protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza and or COVID-19.",

      "quote": "The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions could provide broader specificity. Antisera raised against simple monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine induced protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76-79. The presence of simpler glycans appears to be equally efficient to that of chicken or mammalian cell derived glycosylation in ensuring the proper folding of HA, and exposes conserved regions of the molecule for the induction of immunity with broader protection 12 71 76 80.",

This matches the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. It explains that simpler glycosylation (a feature of recombinant HA) exposes conserved regions, leading to antibodies with broader specificity and cross-clade protection. It also provides evidence from animal studies and references to further studies showing that these structural features of recombinant HA result in more broadly protective antibodies. This mechanistic and experimental evidence substantiates the claim."
