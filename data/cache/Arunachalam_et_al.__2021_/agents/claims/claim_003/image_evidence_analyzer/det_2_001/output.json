  "claim_id": "claim_003",
  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flowchart illustrating the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system for manufacturing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine (RIV4). It shows cloning the HA gene into a baculovirus vector, infecting insect cells in a bioreactor, harvesting via disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration for clarification, chromatographic capture and purification steps including DNA removal, followed by tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure depicts only the manufacturing process of a recombinant HA vaccine and contains no immunogenicity or cross-protection data; it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but focused on production steps; no data on breadth of immune response or mismatch season protection are presented.",
