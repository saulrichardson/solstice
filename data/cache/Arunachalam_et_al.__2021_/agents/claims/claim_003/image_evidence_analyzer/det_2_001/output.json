  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic process flow diagram showing the baculovirus-insect cell expression system for manufacturing a recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4). It depicts cloning of the HA gene into a baculovirus vector, infection of insect cells, expansion in a bioreactor, harvest, extraction, clarification, capture, purification, DNA removal, and formulation steps. The figure only illustrates the manufacturing process of a recombinant HA vaccine and contains no data or statements about immune response breadth or cross-protection in mismatch seasons; it does not support the claim. Note: The image is a process diagram without immunogenicity or efficacy data; limited to production steps.",
