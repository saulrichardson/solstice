  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-panel schematic comparing the structural features of native influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) heterodimer (HA1 in turquoise and HA2 in orange, linked by an inter-disulfide bond, cleaved fusion peptide in green, complex-type sialylated N-linked glycans) versus recombinant HA (rHA) produced in insect cells (single HA0 precursor combining HA1/HA2, uncleaved fusion-peptide loop in green, simpler paucimannosidic N-linked glycans). Evidence: Labels indicating that rHA has simpler glycans and an uncleaved fusion-peptide loop that expose unique epitopes. The figure illustrates structural differences that suggest rHA may expose more epitopes, but it provides no data on immune responses or cross-protection outcomes and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Structural schematic only; no immunogenicity or cross-protection data shown.",
