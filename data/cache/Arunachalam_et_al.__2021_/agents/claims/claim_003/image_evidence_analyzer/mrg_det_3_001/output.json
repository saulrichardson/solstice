  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "Two schematic diagrams comparing native influenza hemagglutinin (HA) extracted from virus (panel a) and recombinant HA (rHA) produced in insect cells via baculovirus expression (panel b). Panel a shows HA1 and HA2 subunits linked by a disulfide bond, cleaved fusion peptide, and complex-type sialylated N-linked glycans. Panel b shows a single HA0 precursor with uncleaved fusion peptide and simpler paucimannosidic N-linked glycans exposing unique epitopes. The figure only illustrates structural differences in glycosylation and fusion-peptide processing between native HA and recombinant HA. It does not present any immunogenicity or cross-protection data, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited to structural schematics; no direct data on immune responses or cross-protection are shown.",
