      "quote": "RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosyla- tion of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that recombinant technology (RIV4) leads to a more robust immune response, which is a prerequisite for broader and potentially cross-protective immunity."
