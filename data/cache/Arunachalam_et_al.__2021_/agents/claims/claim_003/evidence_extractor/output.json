      "quote": "Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64. Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that recombinant technology (RIV4) induces higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies and robust immune responses compared to conventional vaccines, supporting the claim that it leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection."

      "quote": "RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenic ally drifted A/H3 N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3 N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3 N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3 N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of aglycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports 26.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes a study showing that RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) induced stronger cross-reactive antibody responses and higher seroconversion rates to drifted (mismatched) influenza strains, directly supporting the claim of broader immune response and cross-protection in mismatch seasons."

      "quote": "The evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional egg or mammalian cell derived vaccines, particularly in terms of antigen enrichment. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process impurities such as inactivating agents or residual egg protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza and or COVID-19.",

      "quote": "The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross protection against mismatched influenza strains 12 75. The study by Nachbagauer et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent influenza viruses similar to the multiple A/H3 N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82. Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against influenza.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides mechanistic and empirical evidence that recombinant vaccines, by preserving conserved HA stem regions, induce broadly neutralising antibodies and cross-protection against mismatched (drifted) influenza strains, supporting the claim."

      "quote": "These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.",
