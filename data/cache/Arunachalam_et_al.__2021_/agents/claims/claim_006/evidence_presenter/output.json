      "quote": "The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears almost verbatim in the document: 'The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22.' This is found in the middle of the document, in the section describing the recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok). The only minor difference is the addition of '(rHA)' after 'recombinant HA', which does not change the meaning.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) is produced using a novel production platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). This matches the claim exactly, confirming both the novelty of the platform and the use of BEVS in insect cells for HA expression."

      "quote": "In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.",
      "explanation": "A nearly identical quote appears in the document: 'In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculo virus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of aba culo virus poly he drin pro motor.' The only differences are minor (e.g., 'baculo virus' instead of 'baculovirus', 'poly he drin pro motor' instead of 'polyhedrin promoter', and some spacing/formatting). The core content is the same.. The quote directly describes the production process for Flublok (RIV4), stating that insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the influenza HA genes, which are then expressed under the control of a baculovirus promoter. This is a clear and specific description of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) used to produce recombinant HA in insect cells, exactly as the claim asserts."

      "quote": "This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears almost verbatim on page 2: 'This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance.' The wording matches the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and line breaks.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains rHA (recombinant hemagglutinin) derived from BEVS (baculovirus expression vector system). This confirms that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS, which is exactly what the claim asserts."

      "quote": "Fig. 2 Structural features of native HA expressed on influenza virus and rHA produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 4: 'Fig. 2 Structural features of native HA expressed on influenza virus and rHA produced in insect cells using the baculo virus expression vector system.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing and hyphenation ('baculo virus' vs 'baculovirus').. The quote directly states that recombinant HA (rHA) is produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system. This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells via BEVS. The quote is specific and directly supports the core of the claim without requiring inference."

      "quote": "The recombinant quad rival ent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Sup emtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], San of i pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for in activated split virion and subunit vaccines).",
      "explanation": "A very similar version of the quote appears in the document: 'The recombinant quad rival ent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Sup emtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], San of i pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for in activated split virion and subunit vaccines).' The wording is nearly identical, with only minor differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) is produced using recombinant viral proteins, which is a novel approach compared to traditional vaccines that use antigens from live virus. While the quote does not explicitly mention the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) or insect cells, the surrounding text in the document (immediately following the quote) clarifies that 'The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).' Therefore, the quote, in context, genuinely supports the claim."

      "quote": "Capture Purify DNA removal TFF/Formulation Purification system for the manufacture of RIV4. BV baculo virus. Figure adapted eproduced in insect cells.",
      "explanation": "A very similar quote appears on page 3: 'Capture Purify DNA removal TFF/Formulation Purification system for the manufacture of RIV4. BV baculo virus. Figure adapted eproduced in insect cells. J Invertebr Pathol 107 Suppl, S31-41 \u00a9 2011'. The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and formatting. The core content is present.. The quote, though from a figure caption, explicitly links the manufacture of RIV4 (Flublok) to the use of baculovirus (BV) and insect cells. This directly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The mention of 'BV baculo virus' and 'produced in insect cells' in the context of RIV4 manufacturing is specific and factual, requiring no significant inference."
