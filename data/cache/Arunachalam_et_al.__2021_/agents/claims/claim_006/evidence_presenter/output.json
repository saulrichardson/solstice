      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document on page 2, starting with 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines).

The factual content, technical details, and numbers are all preserved and match the quote to verify.. The quote directly and explicitly supports the claim. It states that Flublok (RIV4) is produced using a novel production platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), which is exactly what the claim asserts. No inference is required; the quote is a direct match to the claim."

The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and spacing differences.. The quote directly states that recombinant HA (rHA) is produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system, which is the core of the claim about Flublok's novel production platform. The figure caption explicitly describes the production method and the expression system, providing clear and direct support for the claim."

      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 3 of the document, though with some minor differences in formatting and punctuation. The relevant passage is: 'illness and influenza like illness to a quad rival ent in activated BV expression vector HA gene TFF=Tangential Flow Filtration Fig. 1 Generation of rHA using the baculo virus insect cell express from Cox, M.

Figure adapted eproduced in insect cells. J Invertebr Pathol 107 Suppl, S31-41 \u00a9 2011'. The factual content and technical terms (baculovirus, insect cell expression system, manufacture of RIV4, recombinant HA) are all present and semantically equivalent to the quote provided.. The quote directly references the generation of recombinant HA (rHA) using the baculovirus insect cell expression system for the manufacture of RIV4 (Flublok). It specifically mentions the use of a baculovirus (BV) expression vector and insect cells, which matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). Therefore, the quote genuinely and explicitly supports the claim."

      "explanation": "A schematic diagram showing the baculovirus-insect cell expression system workflow for producing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA), including cloning the HA gene into baculovirus DNA, infecting insect cells, bioreactor expansion, harvest, extraction, clarification, capture, purification, DNA removal, and formulation steps. The caption indicates it\u2019s for manufacture of a recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4). Evidence: Caption and labels explicitly reference the 'baculovirus-insect cell expression system' used to express HA gene, indicating recombinant HA is produced in insect cells using BEVS. The figure supports the claim by explicitly depicting and labeling the use of a baculovirus expression vector system in insect cells to produce recombinant HA, which directly aligns with the described novel production platform for Flublok."

Evidence: Figure legend states: \u201crecombinant HA produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system.\u201d The figure explicitly shows that recombinant HA is produced in insect cells using BEVS, which supports the claim about Flublok\u2019s novel production platform.
