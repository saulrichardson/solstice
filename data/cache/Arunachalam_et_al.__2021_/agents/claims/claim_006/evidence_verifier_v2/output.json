This is found in the middle of the document, in the section describing the recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok). The only minor difference is the addition of '(rHA)' after 'recombinant HA', which does not change the meaning.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) is produced using a novel production platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). This matches the claim exactly, confirming both the novelty of the platform and the use of BEVS in insect cells for HA expression.",
