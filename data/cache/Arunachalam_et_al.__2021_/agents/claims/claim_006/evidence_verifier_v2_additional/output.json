The wording is nearly identical, with only minor differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) is produced using recombinant viral proteins, which is a novel approach compared to traditional vaccines that use antigens from live virus. While the quote does not explicitly mention the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) or insect cells, the surrounding text in the document (immediately following the quote) clarifies that 'The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).' Therefore, the quote, in context, genuinely supports the claim.",
