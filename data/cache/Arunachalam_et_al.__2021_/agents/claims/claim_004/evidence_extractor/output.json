      "quote": "RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosyla- tion of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly compares the immune responses elicited by RIV4 (a recombinant, higher-dose flu vaccine) to those from egg-based and cell-based split vaccines, stating that RIV4 induced significantly higher antibody levels, supporting the claim."

Participant sera were tested against four A/H3 N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenic ally advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3.",
