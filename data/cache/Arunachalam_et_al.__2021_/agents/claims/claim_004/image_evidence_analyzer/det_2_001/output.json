  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart schematic illustrating the manufacturing process of a recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) influenza vaccine (RIV4) using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system. The diagram shows steps including full-length cDNA cloning, recombination with baculovirus DNA, insect cell seeding and bioreactor expansion, harvest, extraction, clarification, chromatographic capture and purification, DNA removal, and tangential flow filtration/formulation. The image depicts only the vaccine production process and contains no data on antibody responses or dose comparisons, so it does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity or comparative clinical data are presented; image quality and completeness appear sufficient for process description only.",
