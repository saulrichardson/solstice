  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart diagram showing the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system for manufacturing a recombinant HA influenza vaccine (RIV4). It includes steps: cloning full-length cDNA into baculovirus DNA with polyhedrin promoter, recombination, infecting insect cells in bioreactors, harvest via disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration (clarification), capture, purification with DNA removal, tangential flow filtration (TFF)/formulation. The image depicts the manufacturing process of a recombinant flu vaccine and provides no data on antibody responses or dosage comparisons, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image contains only process schematic and no immunogenicity or clinical data.",
