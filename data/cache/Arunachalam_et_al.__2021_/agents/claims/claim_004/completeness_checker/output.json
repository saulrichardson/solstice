This directly supports the claim that vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. The context makes clear that the comparison is between RIV4 and conventional (egg-based) vaccines, and the result is a more robust immune response with RIV4.",
