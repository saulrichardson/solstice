      "explanation": "A very similar quote appears on page 5: 'RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epi topes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flu cel vax [Trivalent 77.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and punctuation differences.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (a recombinant flu vaccine) induces antibodies to HA head region epitopes at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine. This supports the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV4) may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines, as it demonstrates a quantitative and qualitative difference in immune response favoring the recombinant vaccine.",
