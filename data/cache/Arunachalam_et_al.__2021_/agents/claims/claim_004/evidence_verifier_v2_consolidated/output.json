The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and line breaks.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (a recombinant, higher-dose flu vaccine) elicited 'significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels' than both egg-derived and cell-derived split vaccines. This directly supports the claim that vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. The context makes clear that the comparison is between RIV4 and conventional (egg-based) vaccines, and the result is a more robust immune response with RIV4.",
