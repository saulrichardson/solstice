The quote is present and semantically equivalent.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (a recombinant influenza vaccine) elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines (egg-derived split and cell-derived split vaccines) in healthy adults. This directly addresses the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. The quote also provides a mechanistic explanation (simpler glycosylation and absence of other viral proteins) for the observed effect.",
