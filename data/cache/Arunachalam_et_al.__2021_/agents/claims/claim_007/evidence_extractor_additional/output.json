RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epi topes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flu cel vax [Trivalent 77. Higher magnitudes of haem agglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flu cel vax Tetra, Seq i rus, and Flu zone quad rival ent SD, San of i Pasteur 60.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that RIV4 (a BEVS-produced recombinant HA vaccine) induces higher levels of antibodies against both the HA stem and head regions, and that these responses are greater than those induced by egg-derived or mammalian cell-derived vaccines.",
