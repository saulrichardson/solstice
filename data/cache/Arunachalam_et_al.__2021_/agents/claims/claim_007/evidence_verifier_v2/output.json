The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and phrasing.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS (the same system used for RIV4) induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem compared to egg-derived split vaccines. This matches the claim's assertion about the superiority of BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens in inducing broadly cross-reactive antibodies targeting conserved HA regions, compared to egg-derived vaccines.",

The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (a BEVS-produced recombinant HA vaccine) induces broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. This supports the claim that BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens induce higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies compared to egg-derived vaccines, especially since the context in the document compares RIV4 to conventional (egg-derived) vaccines and highlights its superior cross-reactivity. While the quote does not explicitly mention 'compared with egg-derived vaccines,' the surrounding text and referenced studies (e.g., Belongia et al.) make this comparison, supporting the claim.",
