The wording and meaning are essentially identical to the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (a BEVS-produced recombinant HA vaccine) induces HA stem-specific neutralizing antibodies against multiple influenza subtypes, and that these responses are higher in the elderly.
