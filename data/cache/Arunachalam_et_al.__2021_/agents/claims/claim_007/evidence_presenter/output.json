      "quote": "Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem compared to egg derived split vaccines 64.",
      "explanation": "A very similar version of the quote appears on page 5: 'Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem compared to egg derived split vaccines 64.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and phrasing.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS (the same system used for RIV4) induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem compared to egg-derived split vaccines. This matches the claim's assertion about the superiority of BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens in inducing broadly cross-reactive antibodies targeting conserved HA regions, compared to egg-derived vaccines."

      "explanation": "A very similar quote appears on page 5: 'RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenic ally drifted A/H3 N2 viruses in humans.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (a BEVS-produced recombinant HA vaccine) induces broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. This supports the claim that BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens induce higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies compared to egg-derived vaccines, especially since the context in the document compares RIV4 to conventional (egg-derived) vaccines and highlights its superior cross-reactivity. While the quote does not explicitly mention 'compared with egg-derived vaccines,' the surrounding text and referenced studies (e.g., Belongia et al.) make this comparison, supporting the claim."

      "quote": "In a study by Nach bag auer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem- specific neutral ising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haem agglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epi topes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flu cel vax [Trivalent 77. Higher magnitudes of haem agglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flu cel vax Tetra, Seq i rus, and Flu zone quad rival ent SD, San of i Pasteur 60.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and some word breaks. The relevant passage is: 'In a study by Nach bag auer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem- specific neutral ising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haem agglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epi topes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flu cel vax [Trivalent 77. Higher magnitudes of haem agglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flu cel vax Tetra, Seq i rus, and Flu zone quad rival ent SD, San of i Pasteur 60.' The wording and meaning are essentially identical to the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (a BEVS-produced recombinant HA vaccine) induces HA stem-specific neutralizing antibodies against multiple influenza subtypes, and that these responses are higher in the elderly. It also states that RIV4 induces antibodies to HA head epitopes at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine, and that higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have been observed with RIV4 compared to both egg- and mammalian cell-derived split vaccines. This provides direct evidence that BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines, as the claim asserts."

      "quote": "The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross protection against mismatched influenza strains 12 75.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 6: 'The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross protection against mismatched influenza strains 12 75.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor differences in punctuation and formatting.. The quote directly supports the claim by stating that recombinant HA antigens produced in insect cells (using BEVS) have a higher quantity and greater accessibility of conserved stem regions, which may contribute to cross-protection against mismatched influenza strains. This implies that BEVS-produced rHA antigens can induce broader, cross-reactive antibody responses compared to traditional egg-derived vaccines, aligning with the claim's assertion."

      "quote": "Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler gly cans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76\u201379.",
      "explanation": "The quote 'Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76\u201379.' appears verbatim on page 5 of the document. The context discusses the impact of glycan complexity on the breadth of antibody response, specifically referencing studies 76\u201379.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that HA with simpler glycans (as found in BEVS-produced recombinant HA) induces more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross-clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans (as found in egg-derived vaccines). This aligns with the claim that BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines."
