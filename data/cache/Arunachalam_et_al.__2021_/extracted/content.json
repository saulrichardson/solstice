Overall, such a high disease burden arries substantial social and economic cost 6 7. Prevention of easonal inﬂuenza epidemics, as well as preparedness for future pandemics, is thus a global priority. Inﬂuenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2, and inﬂuenza B lineages B/Yamagata and B/Victoria circulate routinely in humans and are ncluded in seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines 8. Inﬂuenza A subtypes can lso give rise to highly pathogenic viruses through cross over from nimal reservoirs to humans 9. In the past century, four novel nﬂuenza A virus strains have emerged in this way, each leading to global pandemic (H1N1 in 1918; H2N2 in 1957; H3N2 in 1968; nd H1N1 in 2009). Vaccines against such strains are prepared and tockpiled as government initiatives for emergency use in potential future pandemics. Hae mag glut in in (HA) is the primary antigen in the induction of the ident i cation of the inﬂuenza strains and their like stra most likely to spread during the upcoming season, for in clu sio the vaccine. Ident i cation of the target inﬂuenza strains is ba on surveillance data collected by World Health Organiza (WHO) collaborating centres at six locations in the UK, (including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CD Japan, China and Australia as part of the WHO Global Inﬂue Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)15. The ﬁnal decision resulting vaccine targets is made by individual regulatory bod Inﬂuenza vaccines can afford sign i cant protection aga inﬂuenza illness, even when there is an antigenic misma against the predominant circulating virus strains 16 17. Such cr protection can occur through the priming of the immune sys by vaccination or natural infection and is primarily due antibodies speciﬁc to conserved regions on the HA head stem 18. Vaccines that can induce immunity speciﬁc to circula wild type strains and cross protection to related strains would",

      "text": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26. Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg- adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glut amine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speciﬁc to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferen- tially over the circulating wild type virus 24. During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere inﬂuenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type inﬂuenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25. Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in other inﬂuenza seasons 26 27. Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for H3N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to circulating strains 27.

Consequently, anti- bodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain 26. Contrary to the egg- derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that efﬁciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus 26. The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be conﬁrmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufactur- ing process as it does not use ‘live’ inﬂuenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Inﬂuenza Data (GISAID) database and is conﬁrmed for ﬁdelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type i ﬂ i l d f i i li i d",

RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant inﬂuenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin pro motor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puriﬁed from the clariﬁed cell extract using column chromatograph ies followed by Q mem- brane ﬁltration.

The authors projected that the strategy could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a medium scale pharmaceutical production facility 31. This approach will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process 32. However, E. coli expressed rHA proteins can be subject to mis- folding, contain impurities (e.g., host cell proteins), and do not undergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive pro ces sing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native conformation 31. The resulting processed proteins are less immunogenic than egg derived antigens, with around a 10 fold greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in animal models 31. These inherent complications have prevented large scale manufacturing and eventual commercial is ation of E. coli expressed inﬂuenza vaccines.

Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine induced protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76–79.

The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral in activation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process impurities such as in activating agents or residual egg protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well- established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic inﬂuenza and or COVID-19.
