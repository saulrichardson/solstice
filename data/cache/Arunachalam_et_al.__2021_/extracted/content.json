      "text": "young children and adults aged 65 and older . Extra pulmonary complications of influenza infection constitute a further under- recognised disease burden 4 5. Overall, such ahigh disease burden carries substantial social and economic cost 6 7. Prevention of seasonal influenza epidemics, as well as preparedness for future pandemics, is thus a global priority. Influenza A subtypes H1 N1 and H3 N2, and influenza B lineages B/Yamagata and B/Victoria circulate routinely in humans and are ncluded in seasonal influenza vaccines 8. Influenza A subtypes can also give rise to highly pathogenic viruses through cross over from animal reservoirs to humans 9. In the past century, four novel nfluenza A virus strains have emerged in this way, each leading to a global pandemic (H1 N1 in 1918; H2 N2 in 1957; H3 N2 in 1968; and H1 N1 in 2009). Vaccines against such strains are prepared and stockpiled as government initiatives for emergency use in potential future pandemics. Hae mag glut in in (HA) is the primary antigen in the induction of the identification of the influenza strains and their like strain most likely to spread during the upcoming season, for inclusion ithe vaccine. Identification of the target influenza strains is base on surveillance data collected by World Health Organizatio (WHO) collaborating centres at six locations in the UK, US (including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Japan, China and Australia as part of the WHO Global In flu enz Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)15. The final decision oresulting vaccine targets is made by individual regulatory bodie Influenza vaccines can afford significant protection agains influenza illness, even when there is an antigenic mismatc against the predominant circulating virus strains 16 17. Such cross protection can occur through the priming of the immune system by vaccination or natural infection and is primarily due tantibodies specific to conserved regions on the HA head an stem 18. Vaccines that can induce immunity specific to circulatin wild type strains and cross protection to related strains would b",

      "text": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26. Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg- adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glut amine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferen- tially over the circulating wild type virus 24. During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156 Q, G186 V, and S219 Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25. Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27. Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for H3 N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to circulating strains 27. Differences in HA glycosylation between the",

The authors projected that the strategy could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a medium scale pharmaceutical production facility 31. This approach will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process 32. However, E. coli expressed rHA proteins can be subject to mis- folding, contain impurities (e.g., host cell proteins), and do not undergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive pro ces sing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native conformation 31. The resulting processed proteins are less immunogenic than egg derived antigens, with around a 10 fold greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in animal models 31.

Consequently, anti- bodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26. Contrary to the egg- derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that efficiently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 virus 26. The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufactur- ing process as it does not use ‘live’ influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculo virus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4 or other rHA vaccines in development with the wild type",

The glycosylation of HA has various functions, including regulation of the virus life cycle and arole in disease pathogenesis71. During vaccine manufacture, the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in determining HA N-glycan composition 72 73.

Anti ser a raised against simple mono gly cosy lated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against lethal challenge with H5 N1 compared to anti ser a raised against fully gly cosy lated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of gly cans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine induced protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler gly cans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76–79.

We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral in activation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process impurities such as in activating agents or residual egg protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well- established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza and or COVID-19.

Moreover, another study of commercial influenza vaccine preparations detected other viral proteins such as nucleoprotein and matrix protein (confirmed by a chroma to- graphic separation) that are not shown to be relevant for vaccine effectiveness, and viral RNA fragments (confirmed by activity as say 90 91. Such egg derived or other influenza virus derived proteins (as described above) and influenza viral RNA fragments are not present in recombinant vaccines. Although uncommon, some individuals may be at increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions to component proteins such as oval bum in and those who are sensitised may be at higher risk of clinical manifestations of allergic disease upon exposure 92. Egg protein, viral RNA, and process impurities such as in activating agents or hydro cortisone that are typically present in con ven tional vaccines are absent in RIV4 would eliminate potential adverse reactions, although rare, to these components in vulnerable individuals 93.
