UNIQUE FEATURES OF A RECOMBINANT HAEMAGGLUTININ INFLUENZA
VACCINE THAT INFLUENCE VACCINE PERFORMANCE

Arun B. Arunachalam

The inﬂuenza vaccine ﬁeld has been constantly evolving to improve the speed, scalability, and ﬂexibility of manufacturing, and to
improve the breadth and longevity of the protective immune response across age groups, giving rise to an array of next generation
vaccines in development. Among these, the recombinant inﬂuenza vaccine tetravalent (RIV4), using a baculovirus expression vector
system to express recombinant haemagglutinin (rHA) in insect cells, is the only one to have reached the market and has been
studied extensively. We describe how the unique structural features of rHA in RIV4 improve protective immune responses compared
to conventional inﬂuenza vaccines made from propagated inﬂuenza virus. In addition to the sequence integrity, characteristic of
recombinant proteins, unique post-translational processing of the rHA in insect cells instills favourable tertiary and quaternary
structural features. The absence of protease-driven cleavage and addition of simple N-linked glycans help to preserve and expose
certain conserved epitopes on HA molecules, which are likely responsible for the high levels of broadly cross-reactive and protective
antibodies with rare speciﬁcities observed with RIV4. Furthermore, the presence of uniform compact HA oligomers and absence of
egg proteins, viral RNA or process impurities, typically found in conventional vaccines, are expected to eliminate potential adverse
reactions to these components in susceptible individuals with the use of RIV4. These distinct structural features and purity of the
recombinant HA vaccine thus provide a number of beneﬁts in vaccine performance which can be extended to other viral targets,
such as for COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

Seasonal inﬂuenza is responsible for 290,000–650,000 deaths per
year due to respiratory diseases alone and 3–5 million cases of
severe illness worldwide1–3. In the USA, inﬂuenza was thought to
account for 52.7 hospitalisations per 100,000 people during the
2019–2020 season. These numbers are signiﬁcantly higher in
young children and adults aged 65 and older1,2,4. Extra-pulmonary
complications of inﬂuenza infection constitute a further under-
recognised disease burden4,5. Overall, such a high disease burden
carries substantial social and economic cost6,7. Prevention of
seasonal inﬂuenza epidemics, as well as preparedness for future
pandemics, is thus a global priority.
Inﬂuenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2, and inﬂuenza B lineages
B/Yamagata and B/Victoria circulate routinely in humans and are
included in seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines8. Inﬂuenza A subtypes can
also give rise to highly pathogenic viruses through cross-over from
animal reservoirs to humans9. In the past century, four novel
inﬂuenza A virus strains have emerged in this way, each leading to
a global pandemic (H1N1 in 1918; H2N2 in 1957; H3N2 in 1968;
and H1N1 in 2009). Vaccines against such strains are prepared and
stockpiled as government initiatives for emergency use in
potential future pandemics.
Haemagglutinin (HA) is the primary antigen in the induction of
a protective immune response against the inﬂuenza virus, and
thus a key vaccine target. Expressed as trimeric glycoproteins on
the viral surface, HA binds to sialic acid on target cells to facilitate
host cell entry and mediates the fusion of the viral envelope to the
late endosomal membrane. Neutralising antibodies that block HA
effectively prevent viral entry into target cells and have been
shown to protect the host from infection10,11. Another viral surface
protein, neuraminidase (NA), cleaves sialic acid and releases

budding virus from the infected cells, thus serving as another
important vaccine target. Although the presence of NA is not
required for effective vaccine performance12, its inclusion in
annual inﬂuenza vaccination may help to broaden protection and
reduce inﬂuenza severity13,14.

y
The preparation of the annual inﬂuenza vaccine ﬁrstly requires
the identiﬁcation of the inﬂuenza strains and their like strains,
most likely to spread during the upcoming season, for inclusion in
the vaccine. Identiﬁcation of the target inﬂuenza strains is based
on surveillance data collected by World Health Organization
(WHO) collaborating centres at six locations in the UK, USA
(including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]),
Japan, China and Australia as part of the WHO Global Inﬂuenza
Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)15. The ﬁnal decision on
resulting vaccine targets is made by individual regulatory bodies.
Inﬂuenza vaccines can afford signiﬁcant protection against
inﬂuenza illness, even when there is an antigenic mismatch
against the predominant circulating virus strains16,17. Such cross-
protection can occur through the priming of the immune system
by vaccination or natural infection and is primarily due to
antibodies speciﬁc to conserved regions on the HA head and
stem18. Vaccines that can induce immunity speciﬁc to circulating
wild-type strains and cross-protection to related strains would be
ideal against constantly evolving inﬂuenza viruses. As such, the
conserved regions on the HA head and stem present attractive
targets for development of universal inﬂuenza vaccines19,20.
The annual production of inﬂuenza vaccine through conven-
tional, mostly egg-based platforms, is arduous and a race-
against-time21. The production process, from the selection of
inﬂuenza
strains
to
vaccine
manufacture
and
release

distribution, takes eight to nine months each year. Agile, reliable



==================== PAGE 2 ====================

and egg-free technologies allowing for guaranteed and faster
manufacture of inﬂuenza vaccines are needed to ensure timely
delivery for upcoming epidemic seasons and during potential
avian ﬂu pandemics, when egg supply may be impacted. The
adoption
of
alternative
vaccine
development
approaches
(including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies)
in
the
urgent
response
to
the
COVID-19
pandemic
has
demonstrated the feasibility of using more efﬁcient methods to
produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development
timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (RIV4,
Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], SanoﬁPasteur) was the ﬁrst
licensed inﬂuenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant
viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live inﬂuenza virus
(as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an
unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of
the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel
production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed
in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system
(BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with
recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant inﬂuenza HA
genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus
polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are
extracted using detergent and puriﬁed from the clariﬁed cell
extract using column chromatographies followed by Q mem-
brane ﬁltration. Puriﬁed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer
using tangential ﬂow ﬁltration and passed through sterile
ﬁltration for storage and formulation22. RIV4 has undergone
extensive clinical assessment23, and was ﬁrst approved by FDA in
2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia,
and various other countries.
This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived
rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how
these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably,
the beneﬁts of this manufacturing process can be extended to
other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of
conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection
against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.


POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE
VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE
MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE

A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential
for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire
adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or
mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive
mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the
resultant vaccine24–26. Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg-
adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a
mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine
at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speciﬁc to
receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferen-
tially over the circulating wild-type virus24. During the 2012–2013
northern hemisphere inﬂuenza vaccination campaign, HA from an
egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine
manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype
and several other wild-type inﬂuenza viruses in three positions,
H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%)
observed for H3N2 in the 2012–2013 season was attributed to
these
three
mutations
during
vaccine
production25.
Other
antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine
strain
during
vaccine
manufacturing
are
thought
to
have
contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in
other inﬂuenza seasons26,27.
Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for
H3N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when
the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to
circulating strains27. Differences in HA glycosylation between the

vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have
contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness26. During the
2014–2015 inﬂuenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing
a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged26. For the
2016–2017 season, the inﬂuenza vaccine was updated to include
a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing
the new glycosylation site26. However, this particular glycosylation
site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, anti-
bodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the
glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain26. Contrary to the egg-
derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new
glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that
efﬁciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus26.
The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the
adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are
low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus.
Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must
be conﬁrmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their
originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine
production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate
seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.
Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus
acquiring egg- or cell-adapted mutations during the manufactur-
ing process as it does not use ‘live’ inﬂuenza virus. Instead, DNA
coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the
Global Initiative on Sharing All Inﬂuenza Data (GISAID) database
and is conﬁrmed for ﬁdelity at the working virus bank level28. As
such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using
baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to
the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal
inﬂuenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch
of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wildtype
inﬂuenza strain selected for vaccines is eliminated.


RECOMBINANT HA EXPRESSION SYSTEMS

Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been
used for the manufacture of rHA vaccine antigens. The ﬁrst
candidate recombinant inﬂuenza vaccines to be successfully
manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system
involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA
protein genetically fused with the Toll-like receptor 5 agonist,
Salmonella typhimurium ﬂagellin type 229. The resultant vaccines
elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse
models29. In Phase 1 clinical evaluation, a prototypic quadrivalent
vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune
responses in healthy adults with favourable tolerability30. The
E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high
yields of rHA (200 mg/L of puriﬁed HA protein) using a minimal
number of bioreactors31. The authors projected that the strategy
could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a
medium-scale pharmaceutical production facility31. This approach
will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process32.
However, E. coli-expressed rHA proteins can be subject to mis-
folding, contain impurities (e.g., host-cell proteins), and do not
undergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive proces-
sing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native
conformation31.
The
resulting
processed
proteins
are
less
immunogenic than egg-derived antigens, with around a 10-fold
greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in
animal models31. These inherent complications have prevented
large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of
E. coli-expressed inﬂuenza vaccines.
Vaccines containing plant-derived rHA either in soluble form or
in virus-like particles (VLPs) have been shown to be safe and
immunogenic
in
humans34–37.
A
plant-derived
recombinant
quadrivalent VLP (QVLP) at 30 µg dose per strain was found to
be non-inferior in terms of vaccine efﬁcacy against respiratory

illness and inﬂuenza-like illness to a quadrivalent inactivated
inﬂuenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quadrivalent, GlaxoSmithKline)
given at 15 µg dose/strain in adults aged 18 to 64 years37.
However, inconsistency in the expression levels of target proteins,
due to nonspeciﬁc integration of transgene(s) into the host
genome, has been a major challenge with plant-based expression
systems34. The unpredictable yield could adversely impact timely
vaccine production, which typically involves updating at least one
HA component of the vaccine to reﬂect antigenic change in
the circulating inﬂuenza viruses each season. A unique positive
attribute of plant-derived rHA is that it can stimulate innate
immunity that predominantly facilitates Type 1 pro-inﬂammatory
cellular immune responses, potentially as a direct effect of the
plant-origin lipids/glycolipids in the vaccine formulation38. These
stimulatory components in a plant-derived vaccine may need to
be controlled and kept at a constant level, for commercialisation,
to avoid potential severe adverse events caused by enhanced
immune responses in vaccinees.
Several groups have explored the use of adenovirus (AdV),
primarily as a replication-defective vector, for gene delivery and
transgene expression of rHA in the host cells. AdV vectors induce
both cell-mediated and humoral immunity against the expressed
protein,
providing
robust
protection
against
the
targeted
disease39–41. However, pre-existing or acquired immunity against
adenovirus can hamper vaccine effectiveness by neutralising
the vaccine vector and clearing the vector-infected cells. While
the use of non-human adenovirus vectors could potentially
overcome this issue, AdV vector immunity developed through
repeated immunisation (for example during repeated annual
inﬂuenza vaccinations) can dampen the immune response
against the vaccine antigens39,40.
RIV4 is one of only two available inﬂuenza vaccines that are
egg-free. Like other recombinant vaccines, expression of HA in
insect cells does not depend on the generation of reassortant
candidate vaccine viruses selected for robust growth in embryo-
nated
eggs
or
mammalian
cell-lines.
Instead,
HA
genetic
sequences from the wild-type strains selected for inclusion in
the vaccine are inserted into the BEVS, from which high yields of
rHA are harvested and puriﬁed (Fig. 1). This process requires less
than half the time (2–3 months) required for the manufacture of
conventional inﬂuenza vaccines42,43. This is a critical advantage for
the timely supply of inﬂuenza vaccine for both seasonal epidemics
and in pandemic situations. VLPs have been produced successfully

by integrating HA, capsid protein (M1) and neuraminidase (NA)
expressed in insect cells44–46. Although presenting proteins in VLP
structures enhanced their immunogenicity, it compromised the
purity of the vaccines considerably, as VLP structures also
integrated both baculovirus and Sf9 cell proteins. Elimination of
these unwanted proteins from the vaccine required extensive
disassembly and reassembly processing of puriﬁed VLPs, which is
a constraint for the commercial scale manufacturing of vaccines
annually. It also raises the cost and the time it takes to bring the
vaccines to the market. The yield and the cost of various
manufacturing processes and technologies are critical elements
to ensure adequate supply of vaccine at an affordable cost,
especially in a pandemic situation. This aspect of the vaccine
manufacturing has been discussed exhaustively in a report
published by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health
(PATH) and is not covered here47.
Insect cell-derived rHA (RIV4) has been studied extensively by
various groups in both pre-clinical models and humans. The rHA
contained in RIV4 differs from that expressed in other systems in
terms of speciﬁc structural features, the nature of the source
material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on
certain aspects of vaccine safety and efﬁcacy (Fig. 2). Based on
these unique features, RIV4 received ‘product exclusivity’ protec-
tion from FDA, a ‘new active substance’ designation from EMA
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)48 and
an ‘innovative drug’ designation from Health Canada49. The use of
this technology, together with the molecular characterisation of
the product, should facilitate continued evolution of inﬂuenza
vaccines with improved effectiveness and their timely availability
to the public.


THE TERTIARY STRUCTURE OF RECOMBINANT HA PRODUCED
IN INSECT CELLS CAN INFLUENCE VACCINE IMMUNOGENICITY

Inﬂuenza HA is synthesised as a single precursor polypeptide
(HA0), which is generally cleaved into two polypeptides (HA1 and
HA2) extracellularly by trypsin-like serine proteases, furin and
other subtilisin family endoproteases after newly synthesised
virions are released from infected cells50,51. HA cleavage is
essential for the infectivity of inﬂuenza virus. Thus, expression of
these proteases exclusively in the respiratory tract is responsible
for inﬂuenza virus tropism to epithelial cells of the upper and
lower respiratory tract. However, HA from inﬂuenza subtypes H5



==================== PAGE 4 ====================

[FIGURE 1 - See figure_p4_4be6804f.png]

and H7 contains multi-basic cleavage sites that are cleaved by
ubiquitously expressed furin in the trans-Golgi network, making
these strains highly virulent50,52,53. The HA1 and HA2 polypeptides
remain covalently linked by a disulﬁde bond to form heterodimers
(Fig. 2). These molecules, either uncleaved HA0 or cleaved
HA1–HA2 heterodimers, are expressed on the viral membrane
surface as trimers (HA ‘rosettes’). The conversion of HA0 to
HA1–HA2 heterodimers leads to conformational changes that
render the molecule fusion-competent, thus enabling the virus to
infect a new host cell52,54. In inactivated (split and subunit)
vaccines, the HA molecules derived from live inﬂuenza viruses are
present predominantly as HA1–HA2 heterodimers. By contrast, the
rHA included in RIV4 is designed to yield predominantly as a single
HA0 polypeptide (Fig. 2). A previous biochemical study (using SDS-
PAGE under reducing conditions) clearly demonstrated the
predominance of HA0 in recombinant HA H7 subunit complexes,
produced using a BEVS, with no protein bands indicative of HA1 or
HA2 molecules55. Poor processing of HA0 to HA1 and HA2
polypeptides in Sf9 cells has been shown to be due to insufﬁcient
levels of furin-like proteases in the cells56.
The conformational differences between pre-fusion and post-
fusion states of HA and the process of exposure of the fusion
peptide have been well described54. Webster et al.57 demon-
strated, using monoclonal antibodies, that neutralising epitopes
present in the pre-fusion HA0 molecule were lost upon conversion
to the post-fusion HA1–HA2 heterodimer at an acidic pH57.
Similarly, several broadly neutralising antibodies directed against
the highly conserved HA stem region have been shown to block
HA maturation and fusion58. Some of these antibodies are likely to
bind near the uncleaved fusion peptide that protrudes at the
surface of the HA0 rosettes. Turner et al.59 identiﬁed a monoclona
antibody that binds to an epitope on HA molecules that are partly
and
transiently
exposed
in
the
pre-fusion
conformation59
Structural analysis of the antigen-antibody complex revealed a
potential dynamic state where HA undergoes structural ﬂuctua
tions in its pre-fusion state59. A recent study by Khurana et al.60
further demonstrated, using surface plasmon resonance technol
ogy, that the observed broader speciﬁcity of antibodies induced
by RIV4 may be linked to the presence of unique epitopes on
HA060. Additionally, several groups have isolated, using HA0 as the
immunogen or from a phage display library, protective antibodies
speciﬁc to epitopes in the fusion loop region present only in
HA061,62. These antibodies exhibited unprecedented breadth and
potency and neutralised a diverse panel of representative viruses
in group 1 and group 2 inﬂuenza A, blocked protease cleavage o
HA0 and locked HA in the pre-fusion state. Thus, these antibodies
make the virus non-infectious by inhibiting the pH-induced
conformation change and the HA-mediated membrane fusion
that are essential for the virus infectivity. HA molecules presented
on inﬂuenza virions are predominantly in the pre-fusion state
Once the virus binds to a cell or enters the acidic endosome o
infected cells, the fusion loop is cleaved to yield HA1 and HA2, and
the hydrophobic fusion peptide in the N-terminus of HA2 is
sequestered away from membranes in a pocket, limiting its
exposure52,63. Nonetheless, it would be of interest to examine the
immunogenicity of released HA fusion peptides in the post-fusion
state and their potential role in protection, as these are present in
conventional inﬂuenza vaccines. Together, these critical ﬁndings

==================== PAGE 5 ====================

clearly demonstrate structural differences between HA pre-fusion
and post-fusion states, and the presence of unique neutralising
epitopes in the pre-fusion HA0 molecules, which are present in
RIV4 (Fig. 2).
Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes
between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to
result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the
immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff
et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (speciﬁcally
for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced
signiﬁcantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies
against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem
domains than egg-derived split vaccines64. Recently Richards
et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy
adults who received egg-derived split vaccine, cell-derived split
vaccine or RIV4 for three successive inﬂuenza seasons (2015–2016,
2016–2017, and 2017–2018)65. RIV4 elicited the most robust
responses, with signiﬁcantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than
the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosyla-
tion of rHA and absence of other inﬂuenza viral proteins in RIV4
contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and
emphasised the relevance of these features in determining
vaccine efﬁcacy and long-term immunity65.


THE HOMOGENEITY OF RECOMBINANT HA ANTIGENS IN RIV4
MAY IMPROVE THE SAFETY PROFILE OVER CONVENTIONAL
INFLUENZA VACCINES

As described above, HA is expressed on the viral surface as a HA
trimer (rosette). When these are extracted from inﬂuenza viruses,
they form clusters of varying sizes. This has been observed in
conventional inﬂuenza virus-derived vaccines, with estimates of 18
to 1100 trimers per cluster55,66,67. Two distinct populations of
cluster have been observed; the majority have an average diameter
of 150 nm, while the remainder are larger (average diameter,
5500 nm)66. However, the rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniform in size
and presentation, containing around six to eight HA trimers per
cluster at an average diameter of approximately 30–40 nm55,67. The
elution of rHA from RIV4 drug substance as a single peak in size-
exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography is monitored
for the release and the stability of RIV4.
Further
characterisation
by
cryo-electron
microscopy
has
revealed that the HA rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniformly
starﬁsh-shaped; whereas in the split vaccine they are mostly non-
symmetrical and agglomerated into huge structures, resulting in
both starﬁsh- and peanut-shaped heterogeneous particles55.
Additional electron microscopy analysis of split vaccine clusters
showed a highly heterogeneous mixture containing different
types of viral particles containing HA and NA as well as split viral
membrane folded in various shapes, slightly disrupted virions, and
whole virions66.
In Canada between 2000 and 2004, an unusual number of
cases of a syndrome termed as oculo-respiratory syndrome (ORS)
were reported following immunisation with the inactivated
inﬂuenza split-virus vaccine68. Detailed analysis revealed that
ORS, induced within 2 to 24 h of vaccination, was suspected to
be due to the presence of micro-aggregates of unsplit virions in
the conventional egg-derived inﬂuenza vaccines69. High levels of
aggregate content in the split vaccine are believed to have
induced a Type-2 polarised immune response resulting in ORS
based on study results from a mouse model70. Although
extremely rare, this is unlikely to occur with RIV4 that contains
HA rosettes of small and uniform size.


THE N-LINKED GLYCAN STRUCTURE OF RECOMBINANT HA
PRODUCED IN INSECT CELLS DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM
HA IN OTHER INFLUENZA VACCINES

Inﬂuenza HA has a variable number of N-linked glycosylation sites
(depending on the virus strain and subtype) in the globular head
region and the conserved stem region71. The glycosylation of HA
has various functions, including regulation of the virus life-cycle
and a role in disease pathogenesis71. During vaccine manufacture,
the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in
determining
HA
N-glycan
composition72,73.
Glycoproteins
expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex-
type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells
typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated,
paucimannosidic
or oligomannosidic
glycans)74. An et al.72
showed that egg-derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine
kidney) cell-derived HA predominantly contained highly-branched
complex or high-mannose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9
insect cells had relatively small paucimannose glycans (Fig. 2)72.
The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly
conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions
could provide broader speciﬁcity. Antisera raised against simple
monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth
and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against
lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against
fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that
are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine-induced
protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler
glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior
cross-clade protection compared to HA with more complex
glycans76–79. The presence of simpler glycans appears to be
equally efﬁcient to that of chicken or mammalian cell-derived
glycosylation in ensuring the proper folding of HA, and exposes
conserved regions of the molecule for the induction of immunity
with broader protection12,71,76–80.
In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem-
speciﬁc neutralising antibodies directed against inﬂuenza subtypes
H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age-dependent manner in
humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly78. RIV4 also
induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are speciﬁc to
epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a
traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax®
[Trivalent])77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory
antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4
compared to egg- or mammalian cell-derived split vaccines
(Flucelvax® Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone® quadrivalent SD, Sanoﬁ
Pasteur)60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether
rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional
vaccines and whether this underlies the cross-protection against
antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials12,81.
RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross-reactive
antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in
humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged
65–74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high-dose split-virion
inactivated trivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (Fluzone® High Dose,
SanoﬁPasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant
sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell-
propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and
an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift.
The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two
circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or
aIIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted
H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however,
receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to
this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although
the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the
cell-grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the
vaccine strains had led to loss of a glycosylation site and



==================== PAGE 6 ====================

impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent
with previous reports26.
In addition to the above referenced studies, in a recent study
by Shinde et al.83 baculovirus-expressed rHA generated cross-
protective
responses
against
both
circulating
and
drifted
A/H3N2 strains, including in older adults who are at a higher
risk for inﬂuenza and associated medical complications83,84. This
unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related
to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved.
The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically
conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting
in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection
against mismatched inﬂuenza strains12,75. The study by Nachba-
gaeur et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant
vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem-
reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase
with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated
exposure to divergent inﬂuenza viruses similar to the multiple A/
H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82. Therefore,
vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem
can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater
breadth of protection against inﬂuenza.


RECOMBINANT HA ANTIGENS ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO
CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS

In all conventional inﬂuenza vaccines, whether derived from eggs
or mammalian cells, the antigens are exposed to inactivation
agents such as formaldehyde or β-propiolactone (BPL). These
inactivating agents cause numerous modiﬁcations to the antigenic
epitopes on HA through cross-linking or formation of bis-alkylated
groups85–87. These modiﬁcations often result in changes to protein
folding, conformation, and stability88. Unlike conventional vac-
cines, RIV4 does not go through an inactivation step, thus
preserving the native HA conformation of the wild-type virus,
required for optimal protective immune response.


ABSENCE OF EGG OR OTHER INFLUENZA VIRAL COMPONENTS
IN RECOMBINANT HA VACCINE IS LIKELY TO FAVOUR ITS
SAFETY PROFILE

As most split and subunit vaccines are prepared from inﬂuenza
viruses that are grown in embryonated chicken eggs, they contain
egg proteins. Testing of 58 vaccine lots covering six different
seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines produced by ﬁve different manufac-
turers showed that the median ovalbumin concentration was
350 ng/mL89. Moreover, another study of commercial inﬂuenza
vaccine preparations detected other viral proteins such as
nucleoprotein and matrix protein (conﬁrmed by a chromato-
graphic separation) that are not shown to be relevant for vaccine
effectiveness, and viral RNA fragments (conﬁrmed by activity
assay)90,91. Such egg-derived or other inﬂuenza virus-derived
proteins (as described above) and inﬂuenza viral RNA fragments
are not present in recombinant vaccines.
Although uncommon, some individuals may be at increased
risk of hypersensitivity reactions to component proteins such as
ovalbumin and those who are sensitised may be at higher risk of
clinical manifestations of allergic disease upon exposure92. Egg
protein, viral RNA, and process impurities such as inactivating
agents or hydrocortisone that are typically present in conven-
tional vaccines are absent in RIV4 would eliminate potential
adverse reactions, although rare, to these components in
vulnerable individuals93.


CONCLUSIONS

The evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of
the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional

inﬂuenza vaccines that rely on inﬂuenza virions propagated in egg
or mammalian cells, split with detergents with or without further HA
enrichment. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates
the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary
HA structure through egg- or cell-adaptation. We also describe
features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible
for the generation of broad cross-reactive and protective antibodies,
together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The
homogeneity of rHA rosettes and
negligible
process-related
impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses
the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs,
related process-impurities such as inactivating agents or residual
egg-protein,
and
thus
potential
adverse
reactions
to
these
impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well-
established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could
be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where
cross-protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such
as pandemic inﬂuenza and/or COVID-19.
