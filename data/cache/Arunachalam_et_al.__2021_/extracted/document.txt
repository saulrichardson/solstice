Overall, such a high disease burden arries substantial social and economic cost 6 7. Prevention of easonal inﬂuenza epidemics, as well as preparedness for future pandemics, is thus a global priority. Inﬂuenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2, and inﬂuenza B lineages B/Yamagata and B/Victoria circulate routinely in humans and are ncluded in seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines 8. Inﬂuenza A subtypes can lso give rise to highly pathogenic viruses through cross over from nimal reservoirs to humans 9. In the past century, four novel nﬂuenza A virus strains have emerged in this way, each leading to global pandemic (H1N1 in 1918; H2N2 in 1957; H3N2 in 1968; nd H1N1 in 2009). Vaccines against such strains are prepared and tockpiled as government initiatives for emergency use in potential future pandemics.

POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26. Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg- adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glut amine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speciﬁc to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferen- tially over the circulating wild type virus 24. During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere inﬂuenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type inﬂuenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25. Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in other inﬂuenza seasons 26 27. Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for H3N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to circulating strains 27. Differences in HA glycosylation between the

This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the beneﬁts of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epi to pes is critical for imparting cross protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.

adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more efﬁcient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quad rival ent inﬂuenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], SanoﬁPasteur) was the ﬁrst licensed inﬂuenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live inﬂuenza virus (as for in activated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant inﬂuenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin pro motor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puriﬁed from the clariﬁed cell extract using column chromatograph ies followed by Q mem- brane ﬁltration. Puriﬁed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential ﬂow ﬁltration and passed through sterile

and egg free technologies allowing for guaranteed and faster manufacture of inﬂuenza vaccines are needed to ensure timely delivery for upcoming epidemic seasons and during potential avian ﬂu pandemics when egg supply may be impacted The

E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high yields of rHA (200 mg/L of puriﬁed HA protein) using a minimal number of bio reactors 31. The authors projected that the strategy could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a medium scale pharmaceutical production facility 31. This approach will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process 32. However, E. coli expressed rHA proteins can be subject to mis- folding, contain impurities (e.g., host cell proteins), and do not undergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive pro ces sing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native conformation 31. The resulting processed proteins are less immunogenic than egg derived antigens, with around a 10 fold greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in animal models 31. These inherent complications have prevented large scale manufacturing and eventual commercial is ation of E. coli expressed inﬂuenza vaccines. Vaccines containing plant derived rHA either in soluble form or in virus like particles (VLPs) have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans 34 37. A plant derived recombinant quad rival ent VLP (QVLP) at 30 µg dose per strain was found to be non inferior in terms of vaccine efﬁcacy against respiratory

RECOMBINANT HA EXPRESSION SYSTEMS Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been used for the manufacture of rHA vaccine antigens. The ﬁrst candidate recombinant inﬂuenza vaccines to be successfully manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA protein genetically fused with the Toll like receptor 5 ago nist, Salmonella typhimurium ﬂagellin type 229. The resultant vaccines elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse models 29. In Phase 1 clinical evaluation, a prototypic quad rival ent vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune responses in healthy adults with favourable to ler ability 30 The

a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26. However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg adapted virus. Consequently, anti- bodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain 26. Contrary to the egg- derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that efﬁciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus 26. The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be conﬁrmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufactur- ing process as it does not use ‘live’ inﬂuenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Inﬂuenza Data (GISAID) database and is conﬁrmed for ﬁdelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type i ﬂ i l d f i i li i d

vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26. During the 2014-2015 inﬂuenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26. For the 2016-2017 season the inﬂuenza vaccine was updated to include

AdV vectors induce both cell mediated and humoral immunity against the expressed protein providing robust protection against the targeted terms of speciﬁc structural features, the nature of the source material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on certain aspects of vaccine safety and efﬁcacy (Fig. 2).

inﬂuenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quad rival ent, GlaxoSmithKline) given at 15 µg dose strain in adults aged 18 to 64 years 37. However, inconsistency in the expression levels of target proteins, due to nonspeciﬁc integration of trans gene (s) into the host genome, has been a major challenge with plant based expression systems 34. The unpredictable yield could adversely impact timely vaccine production, which typically involves updating at least one HA component of the vaccine to reﬂect antigenic change in the circulating inﬂuenza viruses each season. A unique positive attribute of plant derived rHA is that it can stimulate innate immunity that predominantly facilitates Type 1 pro in amma tory cellular immune responses, potentially as a direct effect of the plant origin lipids/glycolipids in the vaccine formulation 38. These sti mula tory components in a plant derived vaccine may need to be controlled and kept at a constant level, for commercial is ation, to avoid potential severe adverse events caused by enhanced immune responses in vaccinees. Several groups have explored the use of adenovirus (AdV),

purity of the vaccines considerably, as VLP structures also integrated both baculovirus and Sf9 cell proteins. Elimination of these unwanted proteins from the vaccine required extensive disassembly and reassembly processing of puriﬁed VLPs, which is a constraint for the commercial scale manufacturing of vaccines annually. It also raises the cost and the time it takes to bring the vaccines to the market. The yield and the cost of various manufacturing processes and technologies are critical elements to ensure adequate supply of vaccine at an affordable cost, especially in a pandemic situation. This aspect of the vaccine manufacturing has been discussed exhaustively in a report published by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) and is not covered here 47.

exclusion high performance liquid chromatography is monitored for the release and the stability of RIV4. Further character is ation by cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the HA rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniformly starﬁsh-shaped; whereas in the split vaccine they are mostly non- symmetrical and agglomerated into huge structures, resulting in both starﬁsh- and peanut shaped heterogeneous particles 55. Additional electron microscopy analysis of split vaccine clusters showed a highly heterogeneous mixture containing different types of viral particles containing HA and NA as well as split viral membrane folded in various shapes, slightly disrupted virions, and whole virions66. In Canada between 2000 and 2004, an unusual number of cases of a syndrome termed as oculo-respiratory syndrome (ORS) were reported following immunisation with the in activated inﬂuenza split virus vaccine 68. Detailed analysis revealed that ORS, induced within 2 to 24 h of vaccination, was suspected to be due to the presence of micro aggregates of unsplit virions in the conventional egg derived inﬂuenza vaccines 69. High levels of aggregate content in the split vaccine are believed to have

THE HOMOGENEITY OF RECOMBINANT HA ANTIGENS IN RIV4 MAY IMPROVE THE SAFETY PROFILE OVER CONVENTIONAL INFLUENZA VACCINES As described above, HA is expressed on the viral surface as a HA tri mer (rosette). When these are extracted from inﬂuenza viruses, they form clusters of varying sizes.

Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive inﬂuenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with signiﬁcantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosyla- tion of rHA and absence of other inﬂuenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining

clearly demonstrate structural differences between HA pre fusion and post fusion states, and the presence of unique neutral ising epi to pes in the pre fusion HA0 molecules, which are present in RIV4 (Fig. 2). Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (speciﬁcally for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced signiﬁcantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem

RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenic ally drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belong i a et al.82, participants aged 65–74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion in activated trivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (Flu zone High Dose, SanoﬁPasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell- propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenic ally advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post vaccination titre against the antigenic ally drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0 003. The investigators suggested that although

with broader protection 12 71 76 80. In a study by Nach bag auer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem- speciﬁc neutral ising antibodies directed against inﬂuenza subtypes H1, H3 and B hae mag glut in in in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are speciﬁc to epi to pes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flu cel vax [Trivalent 77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flu cel vax Tetra, Seqirus, and Flu zone quad rival ent SD, Sanoﬁ Pasteur 60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81

The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions could provide broader spec i city. Anti sera raised against simple monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to anti sera raised against fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine induced protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76–79. The presence of simpler glycans appears to be equally efﬁcient to that of chicken or mammalian cell derived glycosylation in ensuring the proper folding of HA, and exposes conserved regions of the molecule for the induction of immunity

THE N-LINKED GLYCAN STRUCTURE OF RECOMBINANT HA PRODUCED IN INSECT CELLS DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM HA IN OTHER INFLUENZA VACCINES Inﬂuenza HA has a variable number of N-linked glycosylation sites (depending on the virus strain and subtype) in the globular head region and the conserved stem region 71. The glycosylation of HA has various functions, including regulation of the virus life cycle and a role in disease pathogenesis71. During vaccine manufacture, the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in determining HA N-glycan composition 72 73. Glycoproteins expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex- type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated, paucimannosidic or oli go mannos i dic glycans)74. An et al.72 showed that egg derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cell derived HA predominantly contained highly branched complex or high man nose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9 insect cells had relatively small pau cim an nose glycans (Fig. 2)72.

tur ers showed that the median ovalbumin concentration was 350 ng/mL89. Moreover, another study of commercial inﬂuenza vaccine preparations detected other viral proteins such as nucleoprotein and matrix protein (conﬁrmed by a chroma to graphic separation) that are not shown to be relevant for vaccine effectiveness, and viral RNA fragments (conﬁrmed by activity as say 90 91. Such egg derived or other inﬂuenza virus derived proteins (as described above) and inﬂuenza viral RNA fragments are not present in recombinant vaccines. Although uncommon, some individuals may be at increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions to component proteins such as ovalbumin and those who are sensitised may be at higher risk of clinical manifestations of allergic disease upon exposure 92. Egg protein, viral RNA, and process impurities such as in activating agents or hydro cortisone that are typically present in con ven tional vaccines are absent in RIV4 would eliminate potential adverse reactions, although rare, to these components in vulnerable individuals 93.

Unlike conventional vac- cines, RIV4 does not go through an in activation step, thus preserving the native HA conformation of the wild type virus, required for optimal protective immune response.

vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutral ising HA stem- reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent inﬂuenza viruses similar to the multiple A/ H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belong i a et al.82. Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against inﬂuenza.

This unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved. The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross protection against mismatched inﬂuenza strains 12 75.

inﬂuenza vaccines that rely on inﬂuenza virions propagated in egg or mammalian cells, split with detergents with or without further HA enrichment. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral in activation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process impurities such as in activating agents or residual egg protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well- established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic inﬂuenza and or COVID-19.
