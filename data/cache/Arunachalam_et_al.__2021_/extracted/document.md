POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE
VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE
MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE
A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential
for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire
adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or
mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive
mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the
resultant vaccine24–26. Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg-
adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a
mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine
at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speciﬁc to
receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferen-
tially over the circulating wild-type virus24. During the 2012–2013
northern hemisphere inﬂuenza vaccination campaign, HA from an
egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine
manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype
and several other wild-type inﬂuenza viruses in three positions,
H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%)
observed for H3N2 in the 2012–2013 season was attributed to

circulating strains27. Differences in HA glycosylation between the

This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS derived
rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how
these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably,
the beneﬁts of this manufacturing process can be extended to
other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of
conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection
against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.

has
demonstrated the feasibility of using more efﬁcient methods to
produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development
timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (RIV4,
Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], SanoﬁPasteur) was the ﬁrst
licensed inﬂuenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant
viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live inﬂuenza virus
(as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an
unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of
the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel
production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed
in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system
(BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with
recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant inﬂuenza HA
genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus
polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are
extracted using detergent and puriﬁed from the clariﬁed cell
extract using column chromatographies followed by Q mem-
brane ﬁltration. Puriﬁed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer
using tangential ﬂow ﬁltration and passed through sterile

and egg-free technologies allowing for guaranteed and faster
manufacture of inﬂuenza vaccines are needed to ensure timely
delivery for upcoming epidemic seasons and during potential
avian ﬂu pandemics, when egg supply may be impacted. The

E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high
yields of rHA (200 mg/L of puriﬁed HA protein) using a minimal
number of bioreactors31. The authors projected that the strategy
could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a
medium-scale pharmaceutical production facility31. This approach
will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process32.
However, E. coli-expressed rHA proteins can be subject to mis-
folding, contain impurities (e.g., host-cell proteins), and do not
undergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive proces-
sing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native
conformation31.
The
resulting
processed
proteins
are
less
immunogenic than egg-derived antigens, with around a 10-fold
greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in
animal models31. These inherent complications have prevented
large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of
E. coli-expressed inﬂuenza vaccines.
Vaccines containing plant-derived rHA either in soluble form or
in virus-like particles (VLPs) have been shown to be safe and

humans34–37.

RECOMBINANT HA EXPRESSION SYSTEMS
Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been
used for the manufacture of rHA vaccine antigens. The ﬁrst
candidate recombinant inﬂuenza vaccines to be successfully
manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system
involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA
protein genetically fused with the Toll-like receptor 5 agonist,
Salmonella typhimurium ﬂagellin type 229. The resultant vaccines
elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse
models29. In Phase 1 clinical evaluation, a prototypic quadrivalent
vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune
responses in healthy adults with favourable tolerability30. The

a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing
the new glycosylation site26. However, this particular glycosylation
site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, anti-
bodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the
glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain26. Contrary to the egg-
derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new
glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that
efﬁciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus26.
The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the
adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are
low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus.
Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must
be conﬁrmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their
originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine
production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate
seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.
Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus
acquiring egg- or cell-adapted mutations during the manufactur-
ing process as it does not use ‘live’ inﬂuenza virus. Instead, DNA
coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the
Global Initiative on Sharing All Inﬂuenza Data (GISAID) database
and is conﬁrmed for ﬁdelity at the working virus bank level28. As
such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using
baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to
the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal
inﬂuenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch
of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wildtype

vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have
contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness26. During the
2014–2015 inﬂuenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing
a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged26. For the
2016–2017 season the inﬂuenza vaccine was updated to include

However, inconsistency in the expression levels of target proteins,
due to nonspeciﬁc integration of transgene(s) into the host
genome, has been a major challenge with plant-based expression
systems34. The unpredictable yield could adversely impact timely
vaccine production, which typically involves updating at least one
HA component of the vaccine to reﬂect antigenic change in
the circulating inﬂuenza viruses each season. A unique positive
attribute of plant-derived rHA is that it can stimulate innate
immunity that predominantly facilitates Type 1 pro-inﬂammatory
cellular immune responses, potentially as a direct effect of the
plant-origin lipids/glycolipids in the vaccine formulation38. These
stimulatory components in a plant-derived vaccine may need to
be controlled and kept at a constant level, for commercialisation,
to avoid potential severe adverse events caused by enhanced
immune responses in vaccinees.

purity of the vaccines considerably, as VLP structures also
integrated both baculovirus and Sf9 cell proteins. Elimination of
these unwanted proteins from the vaccine required extensive
disassembly and reassembly processing of puriﬁed VLPs, which is
a constraint for the commercial scale manufacturing of vaccines
annually. It also raises the cost and the time it takes to bring the
vaccines to the market. The yield and the cost of various
manufacturing processes and technologies are critical elements
to ensure adequate supply of vaccine at an affordable cost,
especially in a pandemic situation. This aspect of the vaccine
manufacturing has been discussed exhaustively in a report
published by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health

has
revealed that the HA rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniformly
starﬁsh-shaped; whereas in the split vaccine they are mostly non-

both starﬁsh- and peanut-shaped heterogeneous particles55.
Additional electron microscopy analysis of split vaccine clusters
showed a highly heterogeneous mixture containing different
types of viral particles containing HA and NA as well as split viral
membrane folded in various shapes, slightly disrupted virions, and
whole virions66.
In Canada between 2000 and 2004, an unusual number of
cases of a syndrome termed as oculo-respiratory syndrome (ORS)
were reported following immunisation with the inactivated
inﬂuenza split-virus vaccine68. Detailed analysis revealed that
ORS, induced within 2 to 24 h of vaccination, was suspected to
be due to the presence of micro-aggregates of unsplit virions in
the conventional egg-derived inﬂuenza vaccines69. High levels of
aggregate content in the split vaccine are believed to have

and presentation containing around six to eight HA trimers per

vaccine efﬁcacy and long-term immunity65.
THE HOMOGENEITY OF RECOMBINANT HA ANTIGENS IN RIV4
MAY IMPROVE THE SAFETY PROFILE OVER CONVENTIONAL
INFLUENZA VACCINES
As described above, HA is expressed on the viral surface as a HA
trimer (rosette). When these are extracted from inﬂuenza viruses,
they form clusters of varying sizes. This has been observed in
conventional inﬂuenza virus-derived vaccines, with estimates of 18
to 1100 trimers per cluster55,66,67. Two distinct populations of
cluster have been observed; the majority have an average diameter

domains than egg-derived split vaccines64. Recently Richards
et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy
adults who received egg-derived split vaccine, cell-derived split
vaccine or RIV4 for three successive inﬂuenza seasons (2015–2016,
2016–2017, and 2017–2018)65. RIV4 elicited the most robust
responses, with signiﬁcantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than
the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosyla-
tion of rHA and absence of other inﬂuenza viral proteins in RIV4
contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and
emphasised the relevance of these features in determining

and post-fusion states, and the presence of unique neutralising

RIV4 (Fig. 2).
Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes
between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to
result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the
immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff
et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (speciﬁcally
for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced
signiﬁcantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies

RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross-reactive
antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in
humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged
65–74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high-dose split-virion
inactivated trivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (Fluzone® High Dose,
SanoﬁPasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant
sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell-
propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and
an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift.
The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two
circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or
aIIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted
H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however,
receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to
this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although

with broader protection12,71,76–80.
In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem-
speciﬁc neutralising antibodies directed against inﬂuenza subtypes
H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age-dependent manner in
humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly78. RIV4 also
induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are speciﬁc to
epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a
traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax®
[Trivalent])77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory
antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4
compared to egg- or mammalian cell-derived split vaccines
(Flucelvax® Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone® quadrivalent SD, Sanoﬁ
Pasteur)60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether
rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventiona
vaccines and whether this underlies the cross-protection against
antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials12,81.

The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly
conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions
could provide broader speciﬁcity. Antisera raised against simple
monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth
and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against
lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against
fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that
are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine-induced
protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simple
glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superio
cross-clade protection compared to HA with more complex
glycans76–79. The presence of simpler glycans appears to be
equally efﬁcient to that of chicken or mammalian cell-derived
glycosylation in ensuring the proper folding of HA, and exposes
conserved regions of the molecule for the induction of immunity

THE N-LINKED GLYCAN STRUCTURE OF RECOMBINANT HA
PRODUCED IN INSECT CELLS DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM
HA IN OTHER INFLUENZA VACCINES
Inﬂuenza HA has a variable number of N-linked glycosylation sites
(depending on the virus strain and subtype) in the globular head
region and the conserved stem region71. The glycosylation of HA
has various functions, including regulation of the virus life-cycle
and a role in disease pathogenesis71. During vaccine manufacture,
the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in
determining
HA
N-glycan
composition72,73.
Glycoproteins
expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex-
type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells
typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated,
paucimannosidic
or oligomannosidic
glycans)74. An et al.72
showed that egg-derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine
kidney) cell-derived HA predominantly contained highly-branched
complex or high-mannose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9
insect cells had relatively small paucimannose glycans (Fig. 2)72.

### The evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of
the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional

350 ng/mL89. Moreover, another study of commercial inﬂuenza
vaccine preparations detected other viral proteins such as
nucleoprotein and matrix protein (conﬁrmed by a chromato-
graphic separation) that are not shown to be relevant for vaccine
effectiveness, and viral RNA fragments (conﬁrmed by activity
assay)90,91. Such egg-derived or other inﬂuenza virus-derived
proteins (as described above) and inﬂuenza viral RNA fragments
are not present in recombinant vaccines.
Although uncommon, some individuals may be at increased
risk of hypersensitivity reactions to component proteins such as
ovalbumin and those who are sensitised may be at higher risk of
clinical manifestations of allergic disease upon exposure92. Egg
protein, viral RNA, and process impurities such as inactivating
agents or hydrocortisone that are typically present in conven-
tional vaccines are absent in RIV4 would eliminate potential
adverse reactions, although rare, to these components in
vulnerable individuals93.

with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated
exposure to divergent inﬂuenza viruses similar to the multiple A/
H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82. Therefore,
vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem
can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater
breadth of protection against inﬂuenza.

unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related

The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically
conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting
in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection
against mismatched inﬂuenza strains12,75. The study by Nachba-

inﬂuenza vaccines that rely on inﬂuenza virions propagated in egg
or mammalian cells, split with detergents with or without further HA
enrichment. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates
the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary
HA structure through egg- or cell-adaptation. We also describe
features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible
for the generation of broad cross-reactive and protective antibodies,
together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The
homogeneity of rHA rosettes and
negligible
process-related
impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses
the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs,
related process-impurities such as inactivating agents or residual
egg-protein,
and
thus
potential
adverse
reactions
to
these
impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well-
established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could
be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where
cross-protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such
as pandemic inﬂuenza and/or COVID-19.
