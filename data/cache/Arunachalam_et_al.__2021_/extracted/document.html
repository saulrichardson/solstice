<div class="title">Unique features of a recombinant haemagglutinin inﬂuenza
vaccine that inﬂuence vaccine performance</div>
<div class="text">Arun B. Arunachalam<br>1✉, Penny Post2 and Deborah Rudin3</div>
<div class="text">The inﬂuenza vaccine ﬁeld has been constantly evolving to improve the speed, scalability, and ﬂexibility of manufacturing, and to<br>improve the breadth and longevity of the protective immune response across age groups, giving rise to an array of next generation<br>vaccines in development. Among these, the recombinant inﬂuenza vaccine tetravalent (RIV4), using a baculovirus expression vector<br>system to express recombinant haemagglutinin (rHA) in insect cells, is the only one to have reached the market and has been<br>studied extensively. We describe how the unique structural features of rHA in RIV4 improve protective immune responses compared<br>to conventional inﬂuenza vaccines made from propagated inﬂuenza virus. In addition to the sequence integrity, characteristic of<br>recombinant proteins, unique post-translational processing of the rHA in insect cells instills favourable tertiary and quaternary<br>structural features. The absence of protease-driven cleavage and addition of simple N-linked glycans help to preserve and expose<br>certain conserved epitopes on HA molecules, which are likely responsible for the high levels of broadly cross-reactive and protective<br>antibodies with rare speciﬁcities observed with RIV4. Furthermore, the presence of uniform compact HA oligomers and absence of<br>egg proteins, viral RNA or process impurities, typically found in conventional vaccines, are expected to eliminate potential adverse<br>reactions to these components in susceptible individuals with the use of RIV4. These distinct structural features and purity of the<br>recombinant HA vaccine thus provide a number of beneﬁts in vaccine performance which can be extended to other viral targets,<br>such as for COVID-19.</div>

<div class="title">INTRODUCTION</div>
<div class="text">Seasonal inﬂuenza is responsible for 290,000–650,000 deaths per<br>year due to respiratory diseases alone and 3–5 million cases of<br>severe illness worldwide1–3. In the USA, inﬂuenza was thought to<br>account for 52.7 hospitalisations per 100,000 people during the<br>2019–2020 season. These numbers are signiﬁcantly higher in<br>young children and adults aged 65 and older1,2,4. Extra-pulmonary<br>complications of inﬂuenza infection constitute a further under-<br>recognised disease burden4,5. Overall, such a high disease burden<br>carries substantial social and economic cost6,7. Prevention of<br>seasonal inﬂuenza epidemics, as well as preparedness for future<br>pandemics, is thus a global priority.<br>Inﬂuenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2, and inﬂuenza B lineages<br>B/Yamagata and B/Victoria circulate routinely in humans and are<br>included in seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines8. Inﬂuenza A subtypes can<br>also give rise to highly pathogenic viruses through cross-over from<br>animal reservoirs to humans9. In the past century, four novel<br>inﬂuenza A virus strains have emerged in this way, each leading to<br>a global pandemic (H1N1 in 1918; H2N2 in 1957; H3N2 in 1968;<br>and H1N1 in 2009). Vaccines against such strains are prepared and<br>stockpiled as government initiatives for emergency use in<br>potential future pandemics.<br>Haemagglutinin (HA) is the primary antigen in the induction of<br>a protective immune response against the inﬂuenza virus, and<br>thus a key vaccine target. Expressed as trimeric glycoproteins on<br>the viral surface, HA binds to sialic acid on target cells to facilitate<br>host cell entry and mediates the fusion of the viral envelope to the<br>late endosomal membrane. Neutralising antibodies that block HA<br>effectively prevent viral entry into target cells and have been<br>shown to protect the host from infection10,11. Another viral surface<br>protein, neuraminidase (NA), cleaves sialic acid and releases</div>

<div class="text">budding virus from the infected cells, thus serving as another<br>important vaccine target. Although the presence of NA is not<br>required for effective vaccine performance12, its inclusion in<br>annual inﬂuenza vaccination may help to broaden protection and<br>reduce inﬂuenza severity13,14.</div>
<div class="text">y<br>The preparation of the annual inﬂuenza vaccine ﬁrstly requires<br>the identiﬁcation of the inﬂuenza strains and their like strains,<br>most likely to spread during the upcoming season, for inclusion in<br>the vaccine. Identiﬁcation of the target inﬂuenza strains is based<br>on surveillance data collected by World Health Organization<br>(WHO) collaborating centres at six locations in the UK, USA<br>(including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]),<br>Japan, China and Australia as part of the WHO Global Inﬂuenza<br>Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)15. The ﬁnal decision on<br>resulting vaccine targets is made by individual regulatory bodies.<br>Inﬂuenza vaccines can afford signiﬁcant protection against<br>inﬂuenza illness, even when there is an antigenic mismatch<br>against the predominant circulating virus strains16,17. Such cross-<br>protection can occur through the priming of the immune system<br>by vaccination or natural infection and is primarily due to<br>antibodies speciﬁc to conserved regions on the HA head and<br>stem18. Vaccines that can induce immunity speciﬁc to circulating<br>wild-type strains and cross-protection to related strains would be<br>ideal against constantly evolving inﬂuenza viruses. As such, the<br>conserved regions on the HA head and stem present attractive<br>targets for development of universal inﬂuenza vaccines19,20.<br>The annual production of inﬂuenza vaccine through conven-<br>tional, mostly egg-based platforms, is arduous and a race-<br>against-time21. The production process, from the selection of<br>inﬂuenza<br>strains<br>to<br>vaccine<br>manufacture<br>and<br>release<br>for<br>distribution, takes eight to nine months each year. Agile, reliable</div>

<div class="text">and egg-free technologies allowing for guaranteed and faster<br>manufacture of inﬂuenza vaccines are needed to ensure timely<br>delivery for upcoming epidemic seasons and during potential<br>avian ﬂu pandemics, when egg supply may be impacted. The<br>adoption<br>of<br>alternative<br>vaccine<br>development<br>approaches<br>(including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies)<br>in<br>the<br>urgent<br>response<br>to<br>the<br>COVID-19<br>pandemic<br>has<br>demonstrated the feasibility of using more efﬁcient methods to<br>produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development<br>timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (RIV4,<br>Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], SanoﬁPasteur) was the ﬁrst<br>licensed inﬂuenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant<br>viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live inﬂuenza virus<br>(as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an<br>unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of<br>the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel<br>production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed<br>in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system<br>(BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with<br>recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant inﬂuenza HA<br>genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus<br>polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are<br>extracted using detergent and puriﬁed from the clariﬁed cell<br>extract using column chromatographies followed by Q mem-<br>brane ﬁltration. Puriﬁed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer<br>using tangential ﬂow ﬁltration and passed through sterile<br>ﬁltration for storage and formulation22. RIV4 has undergone<br>extensive clinical assessment23, and was ﬁrst approved by FDA in<br>2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia,<br>and various other countries.<br>This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived<br>rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how<br>these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably,<br>the beneﬁts of this manufacturing process can be extended to<br>other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of<br>conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection<br>against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.</div>
<div class="title">POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE
VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE
MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE</div>
<div class="text">A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential<br>for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire<br>adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or<br>mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive<br>mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the<br>resultant vaccine24–26. Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg-<br>adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a<br>mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine<br>at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speciﬁc to<br>receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferen-<br>tially over the circulating wild-type virus24. During the 2012–2013<br>northern hemisphere inﬂuenza vaccination campaign, HA from an<br>egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine<br>manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype<br>and several other wild-type inﬂuenza viruses in three positions,<br>H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%)<br>observed for H3N2 in the 2012–2013 season was attributed to<br>these<br>three<br>mutations<br>during<br>vaccine<br>production25.<br>Other<br>antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine<br>strain<br>during<br>vaccine<br>manufacturing<br>are<br>thought<br>to<br>have<br>contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in<br>other inﬂuenza seasons26,27.<br>Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for<br>H3N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when<br>the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to<br>circulating strains27. Differences in HA glycosylation between the</div>
<div class="text">vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have<br>contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness26. During the<br>2014–2015 inﬂuenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing<br>a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged26. For the<br>2016–2017 season, the inﬂuenza vaccine was updated to include<br>a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing<br>the new glycosylation site26. However, this particular glycosylation<br>site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, anti-<br>bodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the<br>glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain26. Contrary to the egg-<br>derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new<br>glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that<br>efﬁciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus26.<br>The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the<br>adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are<br>low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus.<br>Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must<br>be conﬁrmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their<br>originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine<br>production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate<br>seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.<br>Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus<br>acquiring egg- or cell-adapted mutations during the manufactur-<br>ing process as it does not use ‘live’ inﬂuenza virus. Instead, DNA<br>coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the<br>Global Initiative on Sharing All Inﬂuenza Data (GISAID) database<br>and is conﬁrmed for ﬁdelity at the working virus bank level28. As<br>such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using<br>baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to<br>the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal<br>inﬂuenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch<br>of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wildtype<br>inﬂuenza strain selected for vaccines is eliminated.</div>
<div class="title">RECOMBINANT HA EXPRESSION SYSTEMS</div>
<div class="text">Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been<br>used for the manufacture of rHA vaccine antigens. The ﬁrst<br>candidate recombinant inﬂuenza vaccines to be successfully<br>manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system<br>involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA<br>protein genetically fused with the Toll-like receptor 5 agonist,<br>Salmonella typhimurium ﬂagellin type 229. The resultant vaccines<br>elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse<br>models29. In Phase 1 clinical evaluation, a prototypic quadrivalent<br>vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune<br>responses in healthy adults with favourable tolerability30. The<br>E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high<br>yields of rHA (200 mg/L of puriﬁed HA protein) using a minimal<br>number of bioreactors31. The authors projected that the strategy<br>could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a<br>medium-scale pharmaceutical production facility31. This approach<br>will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process32.<br>However, E. coli-expressed rHA proteins can be subject to mis-<br>folding, contain impurities (e.g., host-cell proteins), and do not<br>undergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive proces-<br>sing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native<br>conformation31.<br>The<br>resulting<br>processed<br>proteins<br>are<br>less<br>immunogenic than egg-derived antigens, with around a 10-fold<br>greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in<br>animal models31. These inherent complications have prevented<br>large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of<br>E. coli-expressed inﬂuenza vaccines.<br>Vaccines containing plant-derived rHA either in soluble form or<br>in virus-like particles (VLPs) have been shown to be safe and<br>immunogenic<br>in<br>humans34–37.<br>A<br>plant-derived<br>recombinant<br>quadrivalent VLP (QVLP) at 30 µg dose per strain was found to<br>be non-inferior in terms of vaccine efﬁcacy against respiratory</div>

The unpredictable yield could adversely impact timely<br>vaccine production, which typically involves updating at least one<br>HA component of the vaccine to reﬂect antigenic change in<br>the circulating inﬂuenza viruses each season. A unique positive<br>attribute of plant-derived rHA is that it can stimulate innate<br>immunity that predominantly facilitates Type 1 pro-inﬂammatory<br>cellular immune responses, potentially as a direct effect of the<br>plant-origin lipids/glycolipids in the vaccine formulation38. These<br>stimulatory components in a plant-derived vaccine may need to<br>be controlled and kept at a constant level, for commercialisation,<br>to avoid potential severe adverse events caused by enhanced<br>immune responses in vaccinees.<br>Several groups have explored the use of adenovirus (AdV),<br>primarily as a replication-defective vector, for gene delivery and<br>transgene expression of rHA in the host cells. AdV vectors induce<br>both cell-mediated and humoral immunity against the expressed<br>protein,<br>providing<br>robust<br>protection<br>against<br>the<br>targeted<br>disease39–41. However, pre-existing or acquired immunity against<br>adenovirus can hamper vaccine effectiveness by neutralising<br>the vaccine vector and clearing the vector-infected cells. While<br>the use of non-human adenovirus vectors could potentially<br>overcome this issue, AdV vector immunity developed through<br>repeated immunisation (for example during repeated annual<br>inﬂuenza vaccinations) can dampen the immune response<br>against the vaccine antigens39,40.<br>RIV4 is one of only two available inﬂuenza vaccines that are<br>egg-free. Like other recombinant vaccines, expression of HA in<br>insect cells does not depend on the generation of reassortant<br>candidate vaccine viruses selected for robust growth in embryo-<br>nated<br>eggs<br>or<br>mammalian<br>cell-lines.<br>Instead,<br>HA<br>genetic<br>sequences from the wild-type strains selected for inclusion in<br>the vaccine are inserted into the BEVS, from which high yields of<br>rHA are harvested and puriﬁed (Fig. 1). This process requires less<br>than half the time (2–3 months) required for the manufacture of<br>conventional inﬂuenza vaccines42,43. This is a critical advantage for<br>the timely supply of inﬂuenza vaccine for both seasonal epidemics<br>and in pandemic situations. VLPs have been produced successfully</div>
<div class="text">by integrating HA, capsid protein (M1) and neuraminidase (NA)<br>expressed in insect cells44–46. Although presenting proteins in VLP<br>structures enhanced their immunogenicity, it compromised the<br>purity of the vaccines considerably, as VLP structures also<br>integrated both baculovirus and Sf9 cell proteins. Elimination of<br>these unwanted proteins from the vaccine required extensive<br>disassembly and reassembly processing of puriﬁed VLPs, which is<br>a constraint for the commercial scale manufacturing of vaccines<br>annually. It also raises the cost and the time it takes to bring the<br>vaccines to the market. The yield and the cost of various<br>manufacturing processes and technologies are critical elements<br>to ensure adequate supply of vaccine at an affordable cost,<br>especially in a pandemic situation. This aspect of the vaccine<br>manufacturing has been discussed exhaustively in a report<br>published by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health<br>(PATH) and is not covered here47.<br>Insect cell-derived rHA (RIV4) has been studied extensively by<br>various groups in both pre-clinical models and humans. The rHA<br>contained in RIV4 differs from that expressed in other systems in<br>terms of speciﬁc structural features, the nature of the source<br>material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on<br>certain aspects of vaccine safety and efﬁcacy (Fig. 2). Based on<br>these unique features, RIV4 received ‘product exclusivity’ protec-<br>tion from FDA, a ‘new active substance’ designation from EMA<br>Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)48 and<br>an ‘innovative drug’ designation from Health Canada49. The use of<br>this technology, together with the molecular characterisation of<br>the product, should facilitate continued evolution of inﬂuenza<br>vaccines with improved effectiveness and their timely availability<br>to the public.</div>

<div class="text">Inﬂuenza HA is synthesised as a single precursor polypeptide<br>(HA0), which is generally cleaved into two polypeptides (HA1 and<br>HA2) extracellularly by trypsin-like serine proteases, furin and<br>other subtilisin family endoproteases after newly synthesised<br>virions are released from infected cells50,51. HA cleavage is<br>essential for the infectivity of inﬂuenza virus.

<div class="text">and H7 contains multi-basic cleavage sites that are cleaved by<br>ubiquitously expressed furin in the trans-Golgi network, making<br>these strains highly virulent50,52,53. The HA1 and HA2 polypeptides<br>remain covalently linked by a disulﬁde bond to form heterodimers<br>(Fig. 2). These molecules, either uncleaved HA0 or cleaved<br>HA1–HA2 heterodimers, are expressed on the viral membrane<br>surface as trimers (HA ‘rosettes’). The conversion of HA0 to<br>HA1–HA2 heterodimers leads to conformational changes that<br>render the molecule fusion-competent, thus enabling the virus to<br>infect a new host cell52,54. In inactivated (split and subunit)<br>vaccines, the HA molecules derived from live inﬂuenza viruses are<br>present predominantly as HA1–HA2 heterodimers. By contrast, the<br>rHA included in RIV4 is designed to yield predominantly as a single<br>HA0 polypeptide (Fig. 2). A previous biochemical study (using SDS-<br>PAGE under reducing conditions) clearly demonstrated the<br>predominance of HA0 in recombinant HA H7 subunit complexes,<br>produced using a BEVS, with no protein bands indicative of HA1 or<br>HA2 molecules55. Poor processing of HA0 to HA1 and HA2<br>polypeptides in Sf9 cells has been shown to be due to insufﬁcient<br>levels of furin-like proteases in the cells56.<br>The conformational differences between pre-fusion and post-<br>fusion states of HA and the process of exposure of the fusion<br>peptide have been well described54. Webster et al.57 demon-<br>strated, using monoclonal antibodies, that neutralising epitopes<br>present in the pre-fusion HA0 molecule were lost upon conversion<br>to the post-fusion HA1–HA2 heterodimer at an acidic pH57.<br>Similarly, several broadly neutralising antibodies directed against<br>the highly conserved HA stem region have been shown to block<br>HA maturation and fusion58. Some of these antibodies are likely to<br>bind near the uncleaved fusion peptide that protrudes at the<br>surface of the HA0 rosettes. Turner et al.59 identiﬁed a monoclona<br>antibody that binds to an epitope on HA molecules that are partly<br>and<br>transiently<br>exposed<br>in<br>the<br>pre-fusion<br>conformation59<br>Structural analysis of the antigen-antibody complex revealed a<br>potential dynamic state where HA undergoes structural ﬂuctua<br>tions in its pre-fusion state59. A recent study by Khurana et al.60<br>further demonstrated, using surface plasmon resonance technol<br>ogy, that the observed broader speciﬁcity of antibodies induced<br>by RIV4 may be linked to the presence of unique epitopes on<br>HA060. Additionally, several groups have isolated, using HA0 as the<br>immunogen or from a phage display library, protective antibodies<br>speciﬁc to epitopes in the fusion loop region present only in<br>HA061,62. These antibodies exhibited unprecedented breadth and<br>potency and neutralised a diverse panel of representative viruses<br>in group 1 and group 2 inﬂuenza A, blocked protease cleavage o<br>HA0 and locked HA in the pre-fusion state. Thus, these antibodies<br>make the virus non-infectious by inhibiting the pH-induced<br>conformation change and the HA-mediated membrane fusion<br>that are essential for the virus infectivity. HA molecules presented<br>on inﬂuenza virions are predominantly in the pre-fusion state<br>Once the virus binds to a cell or enters the acidic endosome o<br>infected cells, the fusion loop is cleaved to yield HA1 and HA2, and<br>the hydrophobic fusion peptide in the N-terminus of HA2 is<br>sequestered away from membranes in a pocket, limiting its<br>exposure52,63. Nonetheless, it would be of interest to examine the<br>immunogenicity of released HA fusion peptides in the post-fusion<br>state and their potential role in protection, as these are present in<br>conventional inﬂuenza vaccines.

Portnoff<br>et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (speciﬁcally<br>for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced<br>signiﬁcantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies<br>against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem<br>domains than egg-derived split vaccines64.

RIV4 elicited the most robust<br>responses, with signiﬁcantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than<br>the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosyla-<br>tion of rHA and absence of other inﬂuenza viral proteins in RIV4<br>contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and<br>emphasised the relevance of these features in determining<br>vaccine efﬁcacy and long-term immunity65.</div>

<div class="text">As described above, HA is expressed on the viral surface as a HA<br>trimer (rosette). When these are extracted from inﬂuenza viruses,<br>they form clusters of varying sizes. This has been observed in<br>conventional inﬂuenza virus-derived vaccines, with estimates of 18<br>to 1100 trimers per cluster55,66,67. Two distinct populations of<br>cluster have been observed; the majority have an average diameter<br>of 150 nm, while the remainder are larger (average diameter,<br>5500 nm)66. However, the rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniform in size<br>and presentation, containing around six to eight HA trimers per<br>cluster at an average diameter of approximately 30–40 nm55,67. The<br>elution of rHA from RIV4 drug substance as a single peak in size-<br>exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography is monitored<br>for the release and the stability of RIV4.<br>Further<br>characterisation<br>by<br>cryo-electron<br>microscopy<br>has<br>revealed that the HA rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniformly<br>starﬁsh-shaped; whereas in the split vaccine they are mostly non-<br>symmetrical and agglomerated into huge structures, resulting in<br>both starﬁsh- and peanut-shaped heterogeneous particles55.<br>Additional electron microscopy analysis of split vaccine clusters<br>showed a highly heterogeneous mixture containing different<br>types of viral particles containing HA and NA as well as split viral<br>membrane folded in various shapes, slightly disrupted virions, and<br>whole virions66.<br>In Canada between 2000 and 2004, an unusual number of<br>cases of a syndrome termed as oculo-respiratory syndrome (ORS)<br>were reported following immunisation with the inactivated<br>inﬂuenza split-virus vaccine68. Detailed analysis revealed that<br>ORS, induced within 2 to 24 h of vaccination, was suspected to<br>be due to the presence of micro-aggregates of unsplit virions in<br>the conventional egg-derived inﬂuenza vaccines69. High levels of<br>aggregate content in the split vaccine are believed to have<br>induced a Type-2 polarised immune response resulting in ORS<br>based on study results from a mouse model70. Although<br>extremely rare, this is unlikely to occur with RIV4 that contains<br>HA rosettes of small and uniform size.</div>
<div class="title">THE N-LINKED GLYCAN STRUCTURE OF RECOMBINANT HA
PRODUCED IN INSECT CELLS DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM
HA IN OTHER INFLUENZA VACCINES</div>
<div class="text">Inﬂuenza HA has a variable number of N-linked glycosylation sites<br>(depending on the virus strain and subtype) in the globular head<br>region and the conserved stem region71. The glycosylation of HA<br>has various functions, including regulation of the virus life-cycle<br>and a role in disease pathogenesis71. During vaccine manufacture,<br>the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in<br>determining<br>HA<br>N-glycan<br>composition72,73.<br>Glycoproteins<br>expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex-<br>type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells<br>typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated,<br>paucimannosidic<br>or oligomannosidic<br>glycans)74. An et al.72<br>showed that egg-derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine<br>kidney) cell-derived HA predominantly contained highly-branched<br>complex or high-mannose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9<br>insect cells had relatively small paucimannose glycans (Fig. 2)72.<br>The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly<br>conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions<br>could provide broader speciﬁcity. Antisera raised against simple<br>monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth<br>and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against<br>lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against<br>fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that<br>are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine-induced<br>protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler<br>glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior<br>cross-clade protection compared to HA with more complex<br>glycans76–79. The presence of simpler glycans appears to be<br>equally efﬁcient to that of chicken or mammalian cell-derived<br>glycosylation in ensuring the proper folding of HA, and exposes<br>conserved regions of the molecule for the induction of immunity<br>with broader protection12,71,76–80.<br>In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem-<br>speciﬁc neutralising antibodies directed against inﬂuenza subtypes<br>H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age-dependent manner in<br>humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly78. RIV4 also<br>induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are speciﬁc to<br>epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a<br>traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax®<br>[Trivalent])77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory<br>antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4<br>compared to egg- or mammalian cell-derived split vaccines<br>(Flucelvax® Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone® quadrivalent SD, Sanoﬁ<br>Pasteur)60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether<br>rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional<br>vaccines and whether this underlies the cross-protection against<br>antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials12,81.<br>RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross-reactive<br>antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in<br>humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged<br>65–74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high-dose split-virion<br>inactivated trivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (Fluzone® High Dose,<br>SanoﬁPasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant<br>sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell-<br>propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and<br>an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift.<br>The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two<br>circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or<br>aIIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted<br>H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however,<br>receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to<br>this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although<br>the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the<br>cell-grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the<br>vaccine strains had led to loss of a glycosylation site and</div>

<div class="text">impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent<br>with previous reports26.<br>In addition to the above referenced studies, in a recent study<br>by Shinde et al.83 baculovirus-expressed rHA generated cross-<br>protective<br>responses<br>against<br>both<br>circulating<br>and<br>drifted<br>A/H3N2 strains, including in older adults who are at a higher<br>risk for inﬂuenza and associated medical complications83,84. This<br>unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related<br>to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved.<br>The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically<br>conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting<br>in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection<br>against mismatched inﬂuenza strains12,75. The study by Nachba-<br>gaeur et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant<br>vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem-<br>reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase<br>with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated<br>exposure to divergent inﬂuenza viruses similar to the multiple A/<br>H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82. Therefore,<br>vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem<br>can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater<br>breadth of protection against inﬂuenza.</div>
<div class="title">RECOMBINANT HA ANTIGENS ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO
CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS</div>
<div class="text">In all conventional inﬂuenza vaccines, whether derived from eggs<br>or mammalian cells, the antigens are exposed to inactivation<br>agents such as formaldehyde or β-propiolactone (BPL). These<br>inactivating agents cause numerous modiﬁcations to the antigenic<br>epitopes on HA through cross-linking or formation of bis-alkylated<br>groups85–87. These modiﬁcations often result in changes to protein<br>folding, conformation, and stability88. Unlike conventional vac-<br>cines, RIV4 does not go through an inactivation step, thus<br>preserving the native HA conformation of the wild-type virus,<br>required for optimal protective immune response.</div>
<div class="title">ABSENCE OF EGG OR OTHER INFLUENZA VIRAL COMPONENTS
IN RECOMBINANT HA VACCINE IS LIKELY TO FAVOUR ITS
SAFETY PROFILE</div>
<div class="text">As most split and subunit vaccines are prepared from inﬂuenza<br>viruses that are grown in embryonated chicken eggs, they contain<br>egg proteins. Testing of 58 vaccine lots covering six different<br>seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines produced by ﬁve different manufac-<br>turers showed that the median ovalbumin concentration was<br>350 ng/mL89. Moreover, another study of commercial inﬂuenza<br>vaccine preparations detected other viral proteins such as<br>nucleoprotein and matrix protein (conﬁrmed by a chromato-<br>graphic separation) that are not shown to be relevant for vaccine<br>effectiveness, and viral RNA fragments (conﬁrmed by activity<br>assay)90,91. Such egg-derived or other inﬂuenza virus-derived<br>proteins (as described above) and inﬂuenza viral RNA fragments<br>are not present in recombinant vaccines.<br>Although uncommon, some individuals may be at increased<br>risk of hypersensitivity reactions to component proteins such as<br>ovalbumin and those who are sensitised may be at higher risk of<br>clinical manifestations of allergic disease upon exposure92. Egg<br>protein, viral RNA, and process impurities such as inactivating<br>agents or hydrocortisone that are typically present in conven-<br>tional vaccines are absent in RIV4 would eliminate potential<br>adverse reactions, although rare, to these components in<br>vulnerable individuals93.</div>
<div class="title">CONCLUSIONS</div>
<div class="text">The evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of<br>the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional</div>
<div class="text">inﬂuenza vaccines that rely on inﬂuenza virions propagated in egg<br>or mammalian cells, split with detergents with or without further HA<br>enrichment. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates<br>the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary<br>HA structure through egg- or cell-adaptation. We also describe<br>features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible<br>for the generation of broad cross-reactive and protective antibodies,<br>together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The<br>homogeneity of rHA rosettes and<br>negligible<br>process-related<br>impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses<br>the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs,<br>related process-impurities such as inactivating agents or residual<br>egg-protein,<br>and<br>thus<br>potential<br>adverse<br>reactions<br>to<br>these<br>impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well-<br>established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could<br>be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where<br>cross-protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such<br>as pandemic inﬂuenza and/or COVID-19.</div>
