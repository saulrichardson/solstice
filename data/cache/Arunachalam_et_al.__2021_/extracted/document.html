<div class="text">POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE<br>VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE<br>MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE<br>A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential<br>for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire<br>adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or<br>mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive<br>mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the<br>resultant vaccine24–26. Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg-<br>adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a<br>mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine<br>at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speciﬁc to<br>receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferen-<br>tially over the circulating wild-type virus24. During the 2012–2013<br>northern hemisphere inﬂuenza vaccination campaign, HA from an<br>egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine<br>manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype<br>and several other wild-type inﬂuenza viruses in three positions,<br>H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%)<br>observed for H3N2 in the 2012–2013 season was attributed to<br>these<br>three<br>mutations<br>during<br>vaccine<br>production25.<br>Other<br>antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine<br>strain<br>during<br>vaccine<br>manufacturing<br>are<br>thought<br>to<br>have<br>contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in<br>other inﬂuenza seasons26,27.<br>Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for<br>H3N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when<br>the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to<br>circulating strains27.

The recombinant quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (RIV4,<br>Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], SanoﬁPasteur) was the ﬁrst<br>licensed inﬂuenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant<br>viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live inﬂuenza virus<br>(as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an<br>unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of<br>the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel<br>production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed<br>in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system<br>(BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with<br>recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant inﬂuenza HA<br>genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus<br>polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are<br>extracted using detergent and puriﬁed from the clariﬁed cell<br>extract using column chromatographies followed by Q mem-<br>brane ﬁltration. Puriﬁed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer<br>using tangential ﬂow ﬁltration and passed through sterile</div>

<div class="text">E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high<br>yields of rHA (200 mg/L of puriﬁed HA protein) using a minimal<br>number of bioreactors31. The authors projected that the strategy<br>could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a<br>medium-scale pharmaceutical production facility31. This approach<br>will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process32.<br>However, E. coli-expressed rHA proteins can be subject to mis-<br>folding, contain impurities (e.g., host-cell proteins), and do not<br>undergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive proces-<br>sing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native<br>conformation31.<br>The<br>resulting<br>processed<br>proteins<br>are<br>less<br>immunogenic than egg-derived antigens, with around a 10-fold<br>greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in<br>animal models31. These inherent complications have prevented<br>large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of<br>E. coli-expressed inﬂuenza vaccines.<br>Vaccines containing plant-derived rHA either in soluble form or<br>in virus-like particles (VLPs) have been shown to be safe and<br>immunogenic<br>in<br>humans34–37.<br>A<br>plant-derived<br>recombinant<br>quadrivalent VLP (QVLP) at 30 µg dose per strain was found to<br>be non-inferior in terms of vaccine efﬁcacy against respiratory</div>

Consequently, anti-<br>bodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the<br>glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain26. Contrary to the egg-<br>derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new<br>glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that<br>efﬁciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus26.<br>The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the<br>adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are<br>low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus.<br>Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must<br>be conﬁrmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their<br>originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine<br>production.

Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that<br>are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine-induced<br>protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simple<br>glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superio<br>cross-clade protection compared to HA with more complex<br>glycans76–79. The presence of simpler glycans appears to be<br>equally efﬁcient to that of chicken or mammalian cell-derived<br>glycosylation in ensuring the proper folding of HA, and exposes<br>conserved regions of the molecule for the induction of immunity</div>
<div class="text">THE N-LINKED GLYCAN STRUCTURE OF RECOMBINANT HA<br>PRODUCED IN INSECT CELLS DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM<br>HA IN OTHER INFLUENZA VACCINES<br>Inﬂuenza HA has a variable number of N-linked glycosylation sites<br>(depending on the virus strain and subtype) in the globular head<br>region and the conserved stem region71. The glycosylation of HA<br>has various functions, including regulation of the virus life-cycle<br>and a role in disease pathogenesis71. During vaccine manufacture,<br>the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in<br>determining<br>HA<br>N-glycan<br>composition72,73.<br>Glycoproteins<br>expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex-<br>type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells<br>typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated,<br>paucimannosidic<br>or oligomannosidic<br>glycans)74. An et al.72<br>showed that egg-derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine<br>kidney) cell-derived HA predominantly contained highly-branched<br>complex or high-mannose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9<br>insect cells had relatively small paucimannose glycans (Fig. 2)72.</div>
