Routine annual <br>influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. For each recipient, <br>a licensed and age-appropriate vaccine should be used. With the exception of vaccination for adults aged ≥65 years, ACIP <br>makes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate <br>vaccine is available. All seasonal influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2022–23 season are <br>quadrivalent, containing hemagglutinin (HA) derived from one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, one influenza A(H3N2) virus, <br>one influenza B/Victoria lineage virus and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s)</div>

<div class="text">2010–11 through 2015–16, influenza vaccination prevented <br>an estimated 1.6–6.7 million illnesses, 790,000–3.1 million <br>outpatient medical visits, 39,000–87,000 hospitalizations, and <br>3,000–10,000 respiratory and circulatory deaths each season <br>in the United States (13). During the severe 2017–18 season, <br>notable for an unusually long duration of widespread high <br>influenza activity throughout the United States and higher <br>rates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations compared with <br>recent seasons, vaccination prevented an estimated 7.1 million <br>illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, <br>and 8,000 deaths (14), despite an overall estimated vaccine <br>effectiveness of 38% (62% against influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 <br>viruses, 22% against influenza A[H3N2] viruses, and 50%</div>
<div class="text">Introduction<br>Influenza viruses typically circulate annually in the United<br>States, most commonly from the late fall through the early<br>spring. Most persons who become ill after influenza virus<br>infection recover without serious complications or sequelae.<br>However, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses,<br>hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults,<br>very young children, pregnant persons, and persons of all ages<br>with certain chronic medical conditions (1–7). Influenza also is<br>an important cause of missed work and school (8–10). Routine<br>annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months<br>who do not have contraindications has been recommended by<br>CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices<br>(ACIP) since 2010 (11).<br>Vaccination provides important protection from influenza<br>illness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of<br>influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors,<br>such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine<br>administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages<br>(for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree<br>of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in<br>the vaccine (12) During each of the six influenza seasons from</div>

The composition of the 2022–23 U.S. seasonal influenza <br>vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H3N2) <br>and influenza B/Victoria components. For the 2022–23 <br>season, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain <br>hemagglutinin (HA) derived from an influenza <br>A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-<br>based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 <br>(H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture–based and <br>recombinant vaccines); an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 <br>(H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an <br>influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell <br>culture–based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza <br>B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus; <br>and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata <br>lineage)-like virus.<br>2.

<div class="text">Certain studies suggest waning occurs to a greater degree<br>against influenza A(H3N2) viruses than against influenza<br>A(H1N1) or influenza B viruses (26,27).

Relatively fewer reports include<br>results specific to children (19–22); findings suggestive of<br>waning have been reported in certain studies (19–21) but<br>not others (22). Rates of decline in vaccine effectiveness also<br>varied. A multiseason (2011–12 through 2014–15) analysis<br>from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu<br>VE) Network found that vaccine effectiveness decreased by<br>approximately 7% per month for influenza A(H3N2) and<br>influenza B and 6%–11% per month for influenza A(H1N1)<br>pdm09 (25). Vaccine effectiveness remained greater than zero<br>for at least 5–6 months after vaccination. In the Hospitalized<br>Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN)<br>during the 2015–16 through 2018–19 seasons, vaccine<br>effectiveness against influenza-associated hospitalizations<br>declined by approximately 8%–9% per month for all adults<br>and approximately 10%–11% per month for those aged<br>≥65 years (32). An analysis of the 2010–11 through 2013–14<br>seasons noted estimated effectiveness ranging from 54% to<br>67% during days 0–180 postvaccination; estimated vaccine<br>effectiveness was not significant during the period between<br>days 181 and 365 (20). A third multiseason analysis (2010–11<br>through 2014–15) conducted in Europe noted a decline<br>in vaccine effectiveness to 0% at 111 days postvaccination<br>against influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Vaccine effectiveness<br>against influenza B viruses decreased more slowly, and vaccine<br>effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses<br>remained roughly stable at 50%–55% throughout the influenza<br>season (27).
