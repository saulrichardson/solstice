<div class="text">Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, <br>adolescents, and adults are developed by the Advisory <br>Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is <br>chartered as a Federal Advisory Committee to provide expert <br>external advice and guidance to the Director of CDC on <br>use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine <br>preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United <br>States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children <br>and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible <br>with recommendations made by the American Academy of <br>Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians <br>(AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and <br>Gynecologists (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of <br>vaccinations in adults are harmonized with recommendations <br>of AAFP, ACOG, and the American College of Physicians <br>(ACP). ACIP recommendations approved by the CDC <br>Director become agency guidelines on the date published in the <br>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

<div class="title">Summary</div>
<div class="text">This report updates the 2021–22 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) concerning <br>the use of seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States (MMWR Recomm Rep 2021;70[No. RR-5]:1–24). Routine annual <br>influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. For each recipient, <br>a licensed and age-appropriate vaccine should be used. With the exception of vaccination for adults aged ≥65 years, ACIP <br>makes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate <br>vaccine is available. All seasonal influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2022–23 season are <br>quadrivalent, containing hemagglutinin (HA) derived from one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, one influenza A(H3N2) virus, <br>one influenza B/Victoria lineage virus, and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s), <br>recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) are expected to be available. Trivalent <br>influenza vaccines are no longer available, but data that involve these vaccines are included for reference.</div>
<div class="text">Influenza vaccines might be available as early as July or August, but for most persons who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine <br>for the season, vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October. However, vaccination should continue after <br>October and throughout the season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. For most adults <br>(particularly adults aged ≥65 years) and for pregnant persons in the first or second trimester, vaccination during July and August <br>should be avoided unless there is concern that vaccination later in the season might not be possible. Certain children aged 6 months <br>through 8 years need 2 doses; these children should receive the first dose as soon as possible after vaccine is available, including <br>during July and August. Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose for <br>the season and for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester if vaccine is available during those months.<br>Updates described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP that were held on October 20, 2021; <br>January 12, 2022; February 23, 2022; and June 22, 2022. Primary updates to this report include the following three topics: <br>1) the composition of 2022–23 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 2) updates to the description of influenza vaccines expected <br>to be available for the 2022–23 season, including one influenza vaccine labeling change that occurred after the publication of <br>the 2021–22 ACIP influenza recommendations; and 3) updates to the recommendations concerning vaccination of adults aged <br>≥65 years. First, the composition of 2022–23 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H3N2) and influenza <br>B/Victoria lineage components. U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 <br>(H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell <br>culture–based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza <br>A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell culture–based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 <br>(Victoria lineage)-like virus; and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. Second, the approved age <br>indication for the cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine, Flucelvax Quadrivalent (ccIIV4), was changed in October <br>2021 from ≥2 years to ≥6 months. Third, recommendations for vaccination of adults aged ≥65 years have been modified. ACIP <br>recommends that adults aged ≥65 years preferentially receive any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: <br>quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or <br>quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for <br>vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza <br>vaccine should be used.<br>This report focuses on recommendations for the use of vaccines <br>for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza during the <br>Corresponding author: Lisa A.

<div class="text">2022–23 influenza season in the United States. A brief summary of the recommendations and a link to the most recent Background <br>Document containing additional information are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html. <br>These recommendations apply to U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines used according to Food and Drug Administration–licensed <br>indications. Updates and other information are available from CDC’s influenza website (https://www.cdc.gov/flu). Vaccination <br>and health care providers should check this site periodically for additional information.</div>
<div class="title">Introduction</div>
<div class="text">Influenza viruses typically circulate annually in the United <br>States, most commonly from the late fall through the early <br>spring. Most persons who become ill after influenza virus <br>infection recover without serious complications or sequelae. <br>However, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses, <br>hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults, <br>very young children, pregnant persons, and persons of all ages <br>with certain chronic medical conditions (1–7). Influenza also is <br>an important cause of missed work and school (8–10). Routine <br>annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months <br>who do not have contraindications has been recommended by <br>CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices <br>(ACIP) since 2010 (11).<br>Vaccination provides important protection from influenza <br>illness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of <br>influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors, <br>such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine <br>administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages <br>(for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree <br>of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in <br>the vaccine (12). During each of the six influenza seasons from <br>2010–11 through 2015–16, influenza vaccination prevented <br>an estimated 1.6–6.7 million illnesses, 790,000–3.1 million <br>outpatient medical visits, 39,000–87,000 hospitalizations, and <br>3,000–10,000 respiratory and circulatory deaths each season <br>in the United States (13). During the severe 2017–18 season, <br>notable for an unusually long duration of widespread high <br>influenza activity throughout the United States and higher <br>rates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations compared with <br>recent seasons, vaccination prevented an estimated 7.1 million <br>illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, <br>and 8,000 deaths (14), despite an overall estimated vaccine <br>effectiveness of 38% (62% against influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 <br>viruses, 22% against influenza A[H3N2] viruses, and 50% <br>against influenza B viruses) (14).<br>Influenza circulated at historically low levels in the United <br>States and globally during the 2020–21 influenza season <br>(15). This was coincident with widespread implementation <br>of nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masking, social <br>distancing, and suspension of in-person work and school) <br>intended to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus <br>that causes COVID-19). Influenza activity increased during the</div>
<div class="text">2021–22 season, although severity indicators (e.g., influenza-<br>associated hospitalizations and deaths) were overall lower than<br>in recent previous seasons (16). Timing, intensity, and severity<br>of the 2022–23 influenza season cannot be predicted. Influenza<br>vaccination remains an important tool for the prevention of<br>potentially severe respiratory illness, which might decrease<br>stress on the U.S. health care system during ongoing circulation<br>of SARS-CoV-2. Guidance for vaccine planning during the<br>COVID-19 pandemic is available at https://www.cdc.gov/<br>vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html.<br>This report updates the 2021–22 ACIP recommendations<br>regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines (17) and<br>provides recommendations and guidance for vaccination<br>providers regarding the use of influenza vaccines in the<br>United States for the 2022–23 season. Various formulations<br>of influenza vaccines are available (Table 1). Contraindications<br>and precautions for the use of influenza vaccines are<br>summarized (Tables 2 and 3). Abbreviations are used in this<br>report to denote the various types of vaccines (Box).<br>This report focuses on recommendations and guidance<br>for the use of seasonal influenza vaccines for the prevention<br>and control of influenza during the 2022–23 season in the<br>United States. A summary of these recommendations and a<br>Background Document containing additional information on<br>influenza, influenza-associated illness, and influenza vaccines<br>are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/<br>vacc-specific/flu.html.</div>
<div class="title">Methods</div>
<div class="text">ACIP provides annual recommendations for the use of<br>influenza vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal<br>influenza in the United States. The ACIP Influenza Work<br>Group meets by teleconference once to twice per month <br>throughout the year. Work group membership includes several<br>voting members of ACIP, representatives of ACIP liaison<br>organizations, and consultants. Discussions include topics <br>such as influenza surveillance, vaccine effectiveness and safety,<br>vaccination coverage, program feasibility, cost effectiveness,<br>and vaccine supply. Presentations are requested from invited<br>experts, and published and unpublished data are discussed.</div>

<div class="text">*	When a contraindication is present, a vaccine should not be administered. When a precaution is present, vaccination should generally be deferred but might be <br>indicated if the benefit of protection from the vaccine outweighs the risk for an adverse reaction (see ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, <br>available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/index.html).

In the absence of data supporting an adequate minimum interval between influenza antiviral use and LAIV4 administration, the <br>intervals provided are based on the half-life of each antiviral. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV4 for which interference might potentially <br>occur might be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Influenza antivirals might also <br>interfere with LAIV4 if initiated within 2 weeks after vaccination. Persons who receive antivirals during the period starting with the specified time before receipt <br>of LAIV4 through 2 weeks after receipt of LAIV4 should be revaccinated with an age-appropriate IIV or RIV4</div>

<div class="title">Primary Changes and Updates</div>
<div class="text">Routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged <br>≥6 months who do not have contraindications continues to be <br>recommended. Primary updates in this report include the following:<br>1.	 The composition of the 2022–23 U.S. seasonal influenza <br>vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H3N2) <br>and influenza B/Victoria components. For the 2022–23 <br>season, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain <br>hemagglutinin (HA) derived from an influenza <br>A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-<br>based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 <br>(H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture–based and <br>recombinant vaccines); an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 <br>(H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an <br>influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell <br>culture–based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza <br>B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus; <br>and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata <br>lineage)-like virus.<br>2.	 Influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2022–23 <br>season, their age indications, and their presentations are <br>described (Table 1). Afluria Quadrivalent is not expected <br>to be available in a 0.25-mL prefilled syringe presentation. <br>When using Afluria Quadrivalent for children aged <br>6 through 35 months (who require a 0.25-mL dose), the <br>dose must be obtained from a multidose vial. One labeling <br>change is described. In October 2021, FDA granted <br>approval for the use of Flucelvax Quadrivalent (cell culture–<br>based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [ccIIV4]) <br>for children aged 6 months through <2 years. As of March <br>2021, Flucelvax Quadrivalent had been approved for <br>persons aged ≥2 years. Approval for children aged 6 months <br>through <2 years was based on results of a randomized, <br>observer-blind study that compared immunogenicity and <br>safety of Flucelvax Quadrivalent with that of a licensed <br>comparator IIV4 among 2,402 children aged 6 through <br>47 months, of whom 894 were aged 6 through 23 months. <br>Flucelvax Quadrivalent is now approved for persons aged <br>≥6 months.<br>3.	 On the basis of review of evidence concerning high-dose <br>inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV), recombinant <br>influenza vaccine (RIV), and MF59-adjuvanted <br>inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV), recommendations <br>for influenza vaccination of persons aged ≥65 years</div>

<div class="text">have been modified. ACIP recommends that adults <br>aged ≥65 years preferentially receive any one of the <br>following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: <br>quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine <br>(HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine <br>(RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza <br>vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available <br>at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any <br>other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used. <br>Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both <br>of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus <br>than standard-dose vaccines (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and <br>45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard-dose <br>inactivated vaccines). Adjuvanted inactivated influenza <br>vaccine (aIIV4) contains MF59 adjuvant.</div>
<div class="title">Recommendations for the Use of 
Influenza Vaccines, 2022–23</div>
<div class="title">Groups Recommended for Vaccination</div>
<div class="text">Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all<br>persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications.<br>Recommendations regarding timing of vaccination,<br>considerations for specific populations, the use of specific<br>vaccines, and contraindications and precautions are summarized<br>in the sections that follow.</div>
<div class="title">Timing of Vaccination</div>
<div class="text">Because timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza<br>activity varies, the ideal time to start vaccinating cannot b<br>predicted each season. Decisions about timing necessitat<br>balancing considerations regarding this unpredictability o<br>the influenza season, possible waning of vaccine-induced<br>immunity over the course of a season, and programmati<br>considerations. Influenza vaccines might be available as early<br>as July or August; however, vaccination during these month<br>is not recommended for most groups because of the possibl<br>waning of immunity over the course of the influenza season<br>(19–32). For most persons who need only 1 dose of influenza<br>vaccine for the season, vaccination should ideally be offered<br>during September or October. However, vaccination should<br>continue after October and throughout the influenza season a<br>long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccin<br>is available.</div>
<div class="text">Considerations for timing of vaccination include the <br>ollowing:<br>•	 For most adults (particularly adults aged ≥65 years) <br>and for pregnant persons in the first or second <br>trimester: Vaccination during July and August should be <br>avoided unless there is concern that vaccination later in <br>the season might not be possible.<br>•	 Children who require 2 doses: Certain children aged <br>6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza <br>vaccine for the season (see Children Aged 6 Months <br>Through 8 Years: Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses) <br>(Figure). These children should receive their first dose as <br>soon as possible (including during July and August, if <br>vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must <br>be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by <br>the end of October.<br>•	 Children who require only 1 dose: Vaccination during <br>July and August can be considered for children of any age <br>who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season. <br>While waning of immunity after vaccination over the <br>course of the season has been observed among all age <br>groups (19–32), there are fewer published studies reporting <br>results specifically among children (19–22). Moreover, <br>children in this group might visit health care providers <br>during the late summer months for medical examinations <br>before the start of school. Vaccination can be considered <br>at this time because it represents a vaccination opportunity.<br>•	 Pregnant persons in the third trimester: Vaccination <br>during July and August can be considered for pregnant <br>persons who are in the third trimester because vaccination <br>might reduce risk for influenza illness in their infants <br>during the first months after birth, when they are too <br>young to receive influenza vaccine (33–36). For pregnant <br>persons in the first or second trimester during July and <br>August, waiting to vaccinate until September or October <br>is preferable, unless there is concern that later vaccination <br>might not be possible.</div>
<div class="text">Community vaccination programs should balance<br>maximizing the likelihood of persistence of vaccine-induced<br>protection through the season with avoiding missed<br>opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of<br>influenza circulation occurs. Efforts should be structured to<br>optimize vaccination coverage before influenza activity in the<br>community begins. Vaccination should continue to be offered<br>as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired<br>vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for</div>

No recommendation is <br>made for revaccination (i.e., providing a booster dose) later <br>in the season of persons who have been fully vaccinated for <br>the season, regardless of when the current season vaccine <br>was received.<br>During the 2022–23 influenza season, SARS-CoV-2 <br>is expected to continue to circulate in the United States, <br>and COVID-19 vaccinations are expected to continue. <br>Current guidance for the administration of COVID-19 <br>vaccines (“Coadministration of COVID-19 vaccines <br>with other vaccines” at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/<br>covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.<br>html#recommendations) indicates that these vaccines can be <br>administered with influenza vaccines; providers should consult <br>this page for updated information. Guidance for vaccine <br>planning during the COVID-19 pandemic is available at <br>https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html.<br>Optimally, vaccination should occur before onset of influenza <br>activity in the community. However, because timing of the onset, <br>peak, and decline of influenza activity varies, the ideal time to <br>start vaccinating cannot be predicted each season. Moreover, <br>more than one outbreak might occur in a community in a single <br>year. In the United States, localized outbreaks indicating the <br>start of seasonal influenza activity can occur as early as October.</div>
<div class="text">However, in 29 (76%) of 38 influenza seasons from 1982–83 <br>through 2019–20, peak influenza activity (which often is close <br>to the midpoint of influenza activity for the season) has not <br>occurred until January or later, and in 23 (61%) seasons, the <br>peak was in February or later (37). Activity peaked in February <br>in 17 (45%) of these seasons (37).<br>An increasing number of observational studies (19–32) have <br>reported decreases in vaccine effectiveness with increasing <br>time postvaccination within a single influenza season. Waning <br>effects have not been observed consistently across age groups, <br>influenza viruses (types, subtypes, and lineages), or seasons. <br>Certain studies suggest waning occurs to a greater degree <br>against influenza A(H3N2) viruses than against influenza <br>A(H1N1) or influenza B viruses (26,27). This effect also <br>might vary with recipient age; in certain studies, waning <br>was more pronounced among older adults (19,23,26,30,32) <br>and younger children (19). Relatively fewer reports include <br>results specific to children (19–22); findings suggestive of <br>waning have been reported in certain studies (19–21) but <br>not others (22). Rates of decline in vaccine effectiveness also <br>varied. A multiseason (2011–12 through 2014–15) analysis <br>from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu <br>VE) Network found that vaccine effectiveness decreased by <br>approximately 7% per month for influenza A(H3N2) and <br>influenza B and 6%–11% per month for influenza A(H1N1)<br>pdm09 (25). Vaccine effectiveness remained greater than zero <br>for at least 5–6 months after vaccination. In the Hospitalized <br>Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) <br>during the 2015–16 through 2018–19 seasons, vaccine <br>effectiveness against influenza-associated hospitalizations <br>declined by approximately 8%–9% per month for all adults <br>and approximately 10%–11% per month for those aged <br>≥65 years (32). An analysis of the 2010–11 through 2013–14 <br>seasons noted estimated effectiveness ranging from 54% to <br>67% during days 0–180 postvaccination; estimated vaccine <br>effectiveness was not significant during the period between <br>days 181 and 365 (20). A third multiseason analysis (2010–11 <br>through 2014–15) conducted in Europe noted a decline <br>in vaccine effectiveness to 0% at 111 days postvaccination</div>

Programmatic <br>issues also are a consideration. Although delaying vaccination <br>might result in greater immunity later in the season, deferral <br>also might result in missed opportunities to vaccinate as <br>well as difficulties in vaccinating a population within a more <br>constrained period. The potential contributions of these factors <br>among persons aged ≥65 years have been assessed using a <br>simulated mathematical model examining various scenarios <br>of vaccination timing, timing of onset of the influenza season, <br>vaccine effectiveness, and rate of waning (39). In this model, <br>during an influenza season beginning in October and peaking <br>in January, delaying vaccination until October resulted in <br>more hospitalizations if >14% of persons aged ≥65 years who <br>would have been vaccinated in August or September failed to <br>get vaccinated. However, these predictions varied considerably <br>with assumed timing of season onset, rate of waning immunity, <br>and vaccine effectiveness.<br>Vaccination efforts should continue throughout the season <br>because the duration of the influenza season varies, and <br>influenza activity might not occur in certain communities <br>until February, March, or later. Providers should offer influenza <br>vaccine routinely, and organized vaccination campaigns should <br>continue throughout the influenza season, including after <br>influenza activity has begun in the community. Although <br>vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine <br>administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has <br>already begun, might be beneficial in most influenza seasons. <br>Providers should offer influenza vaccination to unvaccinated <br>persons who have already become ill with influenza during the <br>season because the vaccine might protect them against other <br>circulating influenza viruses</div>

Persons who care for severely immunocompromised <br>persons requiring a protected environment should not receive <br>LAIV4. ACIP and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices <br>Advisory Committee (HICPAC) have previously recommended <br>that health care personnel who receive LAIV should avoid <br>providing care for severely immunocompromised persons <br>requiring a protected environment for 7 days after vaccination <br>and that hospital visitors who have received LAIV should avoid <br>contact with such persons for 7 days after vaccination (41). <br>However, such persons need not be restricted from caring for <br>or visiting less severely immunocompromised persons.</div>
<div class="text">Influenza Vaccination of Persons with COVID-19<br>Vaccination of persons who have tested positive for COVID-19<br>or who are in quarantine after an exposure should include<br>multiple considerations, such as whether bringing the person<br>into a vaccination setting could expose others to COVID-19,<br>whether the person is acutely ill and the severity of the illness, the<br>presence of risk factors for severe influenza illness, the likelihood<br>of being able to vaccinate at a later date, and the desire to avoid<br>confusing postvaccination symptoms with those of COVID-19.<br>Usually, persons who are in quarantine or isolation should not be<br>brought to a vaccination setting if doing so could expose others to<br>COVID-19. For those who have moderate or severe COVID-19,<br>vaccination should usually be deferred until they have recovered,<br>which is consistent with ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for<br>Immunization (42). For persons who have mild or asymptomatic<br>COVID-19, further deferral might be considered to avoid<br>confusing COVID-19 symptoms with postvaccination reactions.<br>Because recommendations for vaccination of this population<br>might continue to evolve, clinicians should check CDC guidance<br>(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html)<br>for up-to-date information.</div>

Influenza<br>vaccination during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk<br>for respiratory illness and influenza among pregnant and <br>postpartum persons as well as infants during the first several<br>months of life (33–36,49). ACIP and the American College<br>of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that persons<br>who are pregnant or who might be pregnant or postpartum<br>during the influenza season receive influenza vaccine (50). Any<br>licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4<br>may be used. LAIV4 should not be used during pregnancy but<br>can be used postpartum. Influenza vaccine can be administered<br>at any time during pregnancy (i.e., during any trimester), before<br>and during the influenza season. Early vaccination (i.e., during<br>July and August) can be considered for persons who are in<br>the third trimester during these months if vaccine is available<br>because this can provide protection for the infant during the<br>first months of life when they are too young to be vaccinated.<br>Although experience with the use of IIVs during pregnancy<br>is substantial, data specifically reflecting administration of<br>influenza vaccines during the first trimester are limited (see<br>Safety of Influenza Vaccines in the supplementary Background<br>Document). Most studies have not noted an association between<br>influenza vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including <br>spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) (51–61). One observational<br>Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) study conducted during the<br>2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons noted an association between<br>receipt of IIV containing influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and risk<br>for miscarriage in the 28 days after receipt of IIV, when an<br>H1N1pdm09-containing vaccine also had been received the<br>previous season (62). However, in a larger VSD follow-up study,<br>IIV was not associated with an increased risk for miscarriage <br>during the 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15 seasons, regardless<br>of previous season vaccination (63).<br>Substantially less experience exists with more recently licensed<br>IIVs (e.g., quadrivalent and cell culture–based vaccines) during<br>pregnancy than with previously available products. For RIV<br>(available as RIV3 from 2013–14 through 2017–18 and as<br>RIV4 since 2017–18), data are limited to reports of pregnancies<br>occurring incidentally during clinical trials, Vaccine Adverse Event<br>Reporting System (VAERS) reports, and pregnancy registries.<br>Pregnancy registries and surveillance studies exist for certain<br>products, for which information can be found in package inserts.</div>

<div class="text">influenza vaccines: quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza <br>vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine <br>(RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza <br>vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at <br>an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-<br>appropriate influenza vaccine should be administered.<br>Older adults (aged ≥65 years) are at increased risk for severe <br>influenza-associated illness, hospitalization, and death compared <br>with younger persons (4,16,64). Influenza vaccines are often less <br>effective in this population (65). HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have <br>been evaluated in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs in <br>this age group. Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are <br>higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA <br>antigen per virus compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 µg <br>for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for <br>standard-dose inactivated vaccines). The adjuvanted vaccine <br>contains 15 µg of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted <br>SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59.<br>HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared <br>with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available <br>for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these <br>vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-<br>confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66–68) and <br>cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly <br>retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code–defined (rather <br>than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and <br>include more influenza seasons (69–79). Certain observational <br>studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV <br>in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in <br>prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations. The size of <br>this relative benefit has varied from season to season and is not <br>seen in all studies in all seasons, making it difficult to generalize <br>the findings to all or most seasons. Studies directly comparing <br>HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with one another are few and do not <br>support a conclusion that any one of these vaccines is consistently <br>superior to the others across seasons (70–72,79–81).</div>
<div class="text">p<br>(<br>,<br>)<br>Of note, for the 2020–21 season, quadrivalent formulations <br>of high-dose (HD-IIV4) and adjuvanted (aIIV4) influenza <br>vaccines were introduced. Trivalent formulations of <br>these vaccines are no longer available. Data summarizing <br>comparisons of these newer quadrivalent formulations relative <br>to nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4s against laboratory-confirmed <br>influenza outcomes are not yet available.</div>
<div class="text">Literature concerning the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of <br>HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs and of each <br>of these three vaccines with one another was reviewed, focusing <br>on published studies performed during nonpandemic influenza <br>seasons. A description of the systematic review and GRADE is <br>available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/influenza-<br>older-adults.html. An abbreviated summary follows.</div>
<div class="text">p<br>g<br>,<br>,<br>with Nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs: Prevention of Influenza<br>Illnesses. Randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV,<br>and aIIV with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-<br>confirmed influenza illness are few in number and were<br>conducted over few influenza seasons. HD-IIV3 was more<br>effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain<br>reaction (PCR)- or culture-confirmed influenza-like illness<br>(ILI) in a two-season randomized study conducted among<br>32,000 persons aged ≥65 years (relative efficacy: 24%;<br>95% CI: 10%–36%; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single-<br>season randomized trials of RIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV,<br>one a comparison of RIV3 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 that<br>assessed culture-confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison<br>of RIV4 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 that examined PCR-<br>confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of<br>RIV among those aged ≥65 years (pooled relative efficacy:<br>18%; 95% CI: −17% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate).<br>The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4<br>over nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed<br>influenza among the full study population of persons aged<br>≥50 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10%–47%) as well<br>as against culture-confirmed ILI among those aged ≥65 years<br>(relative efficacy: 42%; 95% CI: 9%–65%) (68). No data are<br>available from randomized trials of aIIV versus nonadjuvanted<br>SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes<br>during nonpandemic influenza seasons.</div>
<div class="text">Randomized Studies Comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV <br>with Nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs: Prevention of Influenza-<br>Associated Hospitalizations and Other Serious Events. No <br>data are available from randomized trials evaluating prevention <br>of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations <br>as a primary outcome. In a secondary analysis from a two-<br>season randomized trial of HD-IIV3 versus nonadjuvanted <br>SD-IIV3 assessing serious adverse events (SAEs) (including <br>hospitalizations) associated with laboratory confirmation of <br>influenza performed outside of the study (82) and a post hoc <br>analysis of pneumonia- and influenza-related hospitalizations <br>from a randomized study of HD-IIV3 versus nonadjuvanted <br>SD-IIV4 (83), there was no difference in risk for these <br>events between the two groups (certainty level: 2, moderate). <br>However, additional data are available from two single-<br>season, cluster-randomized studies conducted among U.S. <br>nursing homes (in which nursing homes were randomized to <br>vaccine groups rather than individual persons) that examined <br>prevention of pneumonia and influenza diagnostic–coded <br>hospitalizations. One such study noted a benefit of HD-IIV3 <br>relative to nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 (adjusted relative risk: <br>0.79; 95% CI: 0.66–0.95; certainty level: 2, moderate) (84).</div>

SD-IIV3 (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.65–0.96;

<div class="text">Observational Studies Comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV<br>with Nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs: Prevention of Influenza-<br>Associated Hospitalizations and Deaths. Observational studies<br>comparing HD-IIV and aIIV with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs<br>are more numerous than randomized studies and cover more<br>influenza seasons. Many of these studies assessed diagnostic<br>code–defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes. In<br>these studies, an overall modest relative benefit in prevention of<br>diagnostic code–defined influenza-associated hospitalizations<br>has been observed for HD-IIV3 (70–77) and aIIV3 (70–72)<br>versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3s. Relative benefit was not found<br>in every study for all evaluated seasons for either HD-IIV3 or<br>aIIV3. Published observational studies of RIV are fewer than for<br>HD-IIV and aIIV. A retrospective analysis of relative effectiveness<br>of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 against influenza-coded hospitalizations<br>among Medicare beneficiaries during the 2019–20 season noted a<br>relative effectiveness of 17% (95% CI: 9%–24%; certainty level:<br>3, low) (72). Observational studies that address relative benefit<br>in protection against influenza-associated deaths are limited. Two<br>retrospective cohort studies including three influenza seasons noted<br>a relative benefit of HD-IIV3 compared with nonadjuvanted<br>SD-IIV3 (69,78) diagnostic code–defined deaths (pooled rate<br>ratio: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57–0.84; certainty level: 3, low).<br>Observational Studies Comparing Effectiveness of<br>HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with One Another. Data reflecting<br>comparisons of HD-IIV, aIIV, and RIV with one another<br>are more limited than comparisons with nonadjuvanted<br>SD-IIVs. Observational studies have compared HD-IIV3<br>versus aIIV3 (70–72,79–81), HD-IIV3 versus RIV4 (72),<br>and aIIV3 versus RIV4 (72). A retrospective cohort analysis<br>noted relative effectiveness of RIV4 compared with HD-IIV3<br>(relative effectiveness: 11%; 95% CI: 3%–18%; certainty level:<br>3, low) and with aIIV3 (relative effectiveness: 11%; 95% CI:<br>3%–17%; certainty level: 3, low); these data covered only<br>a single influenza season. Data do not point to a consistent<br>relative benefit of one of these three influenza vaccines over<br>another across multiple seasons.<br>Safety. In comparative safety studies, certain injection site<br>and systemic reactions were observed more frequently in older<br>persons vaccinated with HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 compared with<br>nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 (86,87). In a randomized trial of RIV4<br>versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 among persons aged ≥50 years,<br>frequencies of solicited injection site events were similar or lower<br>among RIV4 recipients; frequency of fever was similar between<br>the two vaccines. Frequencies of SAEs were similar between<br>the two groups, and none was judged to be related to a study</div>
<div class="text">vaccine (68). One postlicensure randomized clinical trial in the <br>United States evaluated the comparative safety of aIIV3 compared <br>with HD-IIV3 in 757 adults aged ≥65 years (88). For the primary <br>outcome, the proportion of participants who reported moderate <br>to severe injection site pain that limited or prevented activity <br>after aIIV3 (12 participants [3.2%]) was noninferior compared <br>with the proportion reporting this outcome after vaccination <br>with HD-IIV3 (22 participants [5.8%]). No participant sought <br>medical care for a solicited reaction symptom, and none had a <br>SAE determined by study investigators to be related to vaccine <br>within 43 days after vaccination.</div>
<div class="title">Immunocompromised Persons</div>
<div class="text">ACIP recommends that persons with compromised <br>immunity (including but not limited to persons with <br>congenital and acquired immunodeficiency states, persons <br>who are immunocompromised due to medications, and <br>persons with anatomic and functional asplenia) should receive <br>an age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4. ACIP recommends that <br>LAIV4 not be used for these groups because of the uncertain <br>but biologically plausible risk for disease attributable to the <br>live vaccine virus. Use of LAIV4 in persons with these and <br>other conditions is discussed in more detail (see Dosage, <br>Administration, Contraindications, and Precautions) (Table 2).<br>Immunocompromised states comprise a heterogeneous <br>range of conditions with varying risks for severe infections. <br>In many instances, limited data are available regarding the <br>effectiveness of influenza vaccines in the setting of specific <br>immunocompromised states (89). Timing of vaccination <br>might be a consideration (e.g., vaccinating during a period <br>either before or after an immunocompromising intervention). <br>The Infectious Diseases Society of America has published <br>detailed guidance for the selection and timing of vaccines for <br>persons with specific immunocompromising conditions (90). <br>Immune response to influenza vaccines might be blunted in <br>persons with certain conditions, such as congenital immune <br>deficiencies, and in persons receiving cancer chemotherapy or <br>immunosuppressive medications.</div>
<div class="title">Persons with a History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome 
After Influenza Vaccination</div>
<div class="text">A history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks <br>of a previous dose of any type of influenza vaccine is considered <br>a precaution for influenza vaccination (Table 2). Persons <br>who are not at higher risk for severe influenza complications <br>(see Populations at Higher Risk for Medical Complications <br>Attributable to Severe Influenza) and who are known to have <br>experienced GBS within 6 weeks of a previous influenza <br>vaccination typically should not be vaccinated. As an alternative <br>to vaccination, providers might consider using influenza</div>
</div>
<div class="page">

<div class="text">antiviral chemoprophylaxis for these persons (91). However, <br>the benefits of influenza vaccination might outweigh the <br>possible risks for certain persons who have a history of GBS <br>within 6 weeks after receipt of influenza vaccine and who also <br>are at higher risk for severe complications from influenza.</div>
<div class="title">Persons with a History of Egg Allergy</div>
<div class="text">Most available influenza vaccines, with the exceptions <br>of RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent, licensed for those aged <br>≥18 years) and ccIIV4 (Flucelvax Quadrivalent, licensed for <br>those aged ≥6 months), are prepared by propagation of virus <br>in embryonated eggs and might contain trace amounts of egg <br>proteins, such as ovalbumin. For persons who report a history <br>of egg allergy, ACIP recommends the following:</div>
<div class="text">•	 Persons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only <br>urticaria (hives) after exposure to egg should receive influenza <br>vaccine. Any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., <br>any IIV4, RIV4, or LAIV4) that is otherwise appropriate for <br>the recipient’s age and health status can be used.<br>•	 Persons who report having had reactions to egg involving <br>symptoms other than urticaria (e.g., angioedema or <br>swelling, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent <br>vomiting) or who required epinephrine or another <br>emergency medical intervention can similarly receive any <br>licensed, recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any IIV4, <br>RIV4, or LAIV4) that is otherwise appropriate for their <br>age and health status. If a vaccine other than ccIIV4 or <br>RIV4 is used, the selected vaccine should be administered <br>in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting, including <br>but not necessarily limited to hospitals, clinics, health <br>departments, and physician offices. Vaccine administration <br>should be supervised by a health care provider who is able <br>to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions.<br>All vaccination providers should be familiar with their <br>office emergency plan and be certified in cardiopulmonary <br>esuscitation (42). No postvaccination observation period is <br>ecommended specifically for egg-allergic persons. However, <br>ACIP recommends that vaccination providers consider <br>observing patients (seated or supine) for 15 minutes after <br>dministration of any vaccine to decrease the risk for injury <br>hould syncope occur (42).<br>Persons with Previous Allergic Reactions to <br>nfluenza Vaccines<br>As is the case for all vaccines, influenza vaccines contain <br>various components that might cause allergic and anaphylactic <br>eactions. Most influenza vaccine package inserts list among <br>ontraindications to their use a history of previous severe <br>llergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the <br>i<br>t<br>i<br>d<br>f<br>i fl<br>i<br>F</div>
<div class="text">ccIIV4 and RIV4, a history of a severe allergic reaction to any <br>vaccine component is listed as a contraindication; no labeled <br>contraindication is specified for a history of allergic reaction to <br>any other influenza vaccine. However, severe allergic reactions, <br>although rare, can occur after influenza vaccination, even <br>among persons with no previous reactions or known allergies. <br>Although vaccine components can be found in package inserts, <br>identifying the causative component without further evaluation <br>(i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can <br>be difficult. Severe allergic reactions after vaccination with <br>an RIV have been reported to VAERS, some of which have <br>occurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions <br>to egg or to influenza vaccines and which might represent a <br>predisposition to development of allergic manifestations in <br>affected persons (92–94). Because these rare but severe allergic <br>reactions can occur, ACIP recommends the following for <br>persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous <br>dose of an influenza vaccine (Table 3):</div>
<div class="text">•	 For egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4:<br>	ű  A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) <br>to any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, <br>RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a contraindication to <br>future receipt of all egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4. Each <br>individual egg-based IIV4 and LAIV4 is also <br>contraindicated for persons who have had a severe <br>allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component <br>of that vaccine (excluding egg) (see Persons with a <br>History of Egg Allergy).<br>•	 For ccIIV4:<br>	ű A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) <br>to any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency is a <br>precaution for the use of ccIIV4.

<div class="title">Vaccination Issues for Travelers</div>
<div class="text">In temperate climate regions of the Northern and Southern<br>Hemispheres, influenza activity is seasonal, occurring during<br>approximately October–May in the Northern Hemisphere and<br>April–September in the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropics,<br>influenza might occur throughout the year. Travelers can be<br>exposed to influenza when traveling to an area where influenza <br>is circulating or when traveling as part of large tourist groups<br>(e.g., on cruise ships) that include persons from areas of the<br>world where influenza viruses are circulating (95–98).<br>Travelers who want to reduce their risk for influenza should<br>consider influenza vaccination, preferably at least 2 weeks<br>before departure. In particular, persons who live in the United<br>States and are at higher risk for influenza complications and<br>who were not vaccinated with influenza vaccine during the<br>previous Northern Hemisphere fall or winter should consider<br>receiving influenza vaccination before departure if they plan<br>to travel to the tropics, to the Southern Hemisphere during<br>the Southern Hemisphere influenza season (April–September),<br>or with organized tourist groups or on cruise ships to any<br>location. Persons at higher risk who received the previous<br>season’s influenza vaccine before travel should consult with<br>their health care provider to discuss the risk for influenza<br>and other travel-related diseases before embarking on travel<br>during the summer. All persons (regardless of risk status) who<br>are vaccinated in preparation for travel before the upcoming<br>influenza season’s vaccine is available should receive the current <br>vaccine the following fall or winter</div>
<div class="text">g<br>Influenza vaccine formulated for the Southern Hemisphere<br>might differ in viral composition from the Northern<br>Hemisphere vaccine. For persons traveling to the Southern<br>Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza<br>season, receipt of a current U.S.-licensed Southern Hemisphere<br>influenza vaccine formulation before departure might be<br>reasonable but might not be feasible because of limited access to<br>or unavailability of Southern Hemisphere formulations in the<br>United States. Most Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine<br>formulations are not licensed in the United States, and they<br>are typically not commercially available. More information on<br>influenza vaccines and travel is available at https://wwwnc.cdc.<br>gov/travel/diseases/influenza-seasonal-zoonotic-and-pandemic.</div>
<div class="title">Use of Influenza Antiviral Medications</div>
<div class="text">Administration of IIV4 or RIV4 to persons receiving influenza <br>antiviral medications for treatment or chemoprophylaxis of <br>influenza is acceptable. Data concerning vaccination with LAIV4 <br>in the setting of influenza antiviral use are not available. However, <br>influenza antiviral medications might interfere with the action <br>of LAIV4 because this vaccine contains live influenza viruses.<br>The package insert for LAIV4 notes that antiviral agents <br>might reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine if given within <br>the interval from 48 hours before to 14 days after vaccination <br>(99). However, the newer influenza antivirals peramivir and <br>baloxavir have longer half-lives than oseltamivir and zanamivir, <br>approximately 20 hours for peramivir (100) and 79 hours for <br>baloxavir (101), and could interfere with the replication of <br>LAIV4 if administered >48 hours before vaccination. Potential <br>interactions between influenza antivirals and LAIV4 have not <br>been studied, and the ideal intervals between administration of <br>these medications and LAIV4 are not known. Assuming a period <br>of at least 5 half-lives for substantial decrease in drug levels (102), <br>a reasonable assumption is that that peramivir might interfere <br>with the mechanism of LAIV4 if administered from 5 days <br>before through 2 weeks after vaccination and baloxavir might <br>interfere if administered from 17 days before through 2 weeks <br>after vaccination. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt <br>and LAIV4 during which interference might occur could be <br>further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that <br>delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Persons <br>who receive these medications during these periods before or <br>after receipt of LAIV4 should be revaccinated with another <br>i<br>i fl<br>i<br>(<br>IIV4<br>RIV4)</div>
<div class="title">Administration of Influenza Vaccines with 
Other Vaccines</div>
<div class="text">IIV4s and RIV4 may be administered simultaneously or <br>sequentially with other inactivated vaccines or live vaccines. <br>Injectable vaccines that are given concomitantly should <br>be administered at separate anatomic sites. LAIV4 can be <br>administered simultaneously with other live or inactivated <br>vaccines. However, if two live vaccines are not given <br>simultaneously, at least 4 weeks should pass after administration <br>of one live vaccine (such as LAIV4) before another live vaccine <br>is administered (42).</div>
<div class="text">Current guidance concerning administration of current U.S.-<br>approved or -authorized COVID-19 vaccines indicates that <br>these vaccines may be given with influenza vaccines (https://<br>www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/<br>interim-considerations-us.html). Providers should be aware of <br>the potential for increased reactogenicity with coadministration <br>and should consult updated CDC guidance as more</div>

<div class="text">information becomes available. If administered simultaneously, <br>COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines that might be <br>more likely to cause an injection site reaction (e.g., aIIV4 <br>or HD-IIV4) should be administered in different limbs, if <br>possible. In an interim analysis of a study of concomitant <br>administration of HD-IIV4 and a booster dose of an mRNA <br>COVID-19 vaccine (administered in separate upper arm sites) <br>compared with administration of either vaccine alone among <br>296 persons aged ≥65 years, overall reactogenicity up to 7 days <br>postvaccination was similar between the coadministration <br>group and the group that received the mRNA COVID-19 <br>vaccine alone; reactogenicity rates in the group receiving <br>HD-IIV4 alone were lower. No SAEs were observed. Immune <br>response was similar between the mRNA COVID-19 and <br>coadministration groups (103).<br>Relatively limited data are available on the concomitant <br>administration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines. <br>Studies of live attenuated zoster vaccine and IIV3 (104) or <br>IIV4 (105) among persons aged ≥50 years noted similar <br>antibody responses whether the two vaccines were administered <br>concomitantly or 4 weeks apart. In certain studies, reduced <br>responses have been noted to 13-valent pneumococcal <br>conjugate vaccine (PCV13) (106,107), tetanus antigens (108), <br>and pertussis antigens (108) when coadministered with IIV3 <br>to adults; in most instances, the clinical significance of this is <br>uncertain. Simultaneous administration of IIV4 and 23-valent <br>pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) to persons <br>aged ≥65 years was associated with lower seroprotection rates <br>to one influenza B antigen at 4–6 weeks postvaccination <br>compared with sequential administration 2 weeks apart. <br>Seroprotection was not significantly different between the <br>two groups for any of the four influenza antigens at 6 months <br>postvaccination (109). Reassuring safety profiles have been <br>noted for simultaneous administration of IIVs with live <br>attenuated zoster vaccine (104,105); PCV13 (106,107); <br>PPSV23 (109,110); tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, <br>and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine among adults (108); and <br>Tdap in pregnancy (111). Although increased prevalence of <br>injection site or systemic adverse reactions has been noted with <br>concurrent administration in certain studies, these symptoms <br>have usually been reported to be mild or moderate.<br>Among children aged 6 through 23 months, coadministration <br>of IIV3 and PCV13 was associated with increased risk <br>for fever on the day of vaccination and the day after (i.e., <br>days 0–1 postvaccination) in an observational study conducted <br>during the 2011–12 season (112). A randomized clinical <br>trial during the 2017–18 influenza season suggested that <br>delaying IIV4 administration by 2 weeks in children receiving <br>diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP)</div>

Increased risk for febrile seizures in this age group has<br>been noted within days 0–1 after coadministration of IIV<br>with PCV7, PCV13, or DTaP vaccines during the 2006–07<br>through 2010–11 seasons (114) and with PCV13 during the<br>2014–15 season (115). Although concerning to parents, most<br>febrile seizures are brief and have a good prognosis (116).<br>After considering the risks and benefits, no changes in the<br>recommendations for administration of these vaccines were<br>made. Surveillance of febrile seizures is ongoing through<br>VAERS, and the VSD annual influenza safety surveillance<br>includes monitoring for seizures after vaccinations. Studies of<br>concomitant administration of LAIV with other vaccines are<br>limited. Concurrent administration of LAIV3 with measles,<br>mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccine to children<br>was not associated with diminished immunogenicity of<br>antigens in any of the vaccines in one study (117); diminished<br>response to rubella was observed in another study examining<br>coadministration of LAIV3 and MMR (118). No safety<br>concerns were noted in these studies.</div>
<div class="text">In recent years, several vaccines containing nonaluminum<br>adjuvants have been licensed for use in the United States for<br>the prevention of various infectious diseases. These include<br>AS01B (in Shingrix, recombinant zoster subunit vaccine) (119),<br>MF59 (in Fluad Quadrivalent [aIIV4]) (120), and cytosine<br>phosphoguanine oligodeoxynucleotide (in Heplisav-B, a<br>recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine) (121). Data are<br>limited regarding coadministration of these vaccines with other<br>adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted vaccines, including COVID-19<br>vaccines. Coadministration of Shingrix with nonadjuvanted IIV4<br>has been studied, and no evidence of decreased immunogenicity or<br>safety concerns was noted (122). The immunogenicity and safety<br>of simultaneous or sequential administration of two nonaluminum<br>adjuvant–containing vaccines have not been evaluated, and the<br>ideal interval between such vaccines when given sequentially<br>is not known. In the study of Shingrix and IIV4 (122), most<br>reactogenicity symptoms resolved within 4 days. Because of<br>the limited data on the safety of simultaneous administration<br>of two or more vaccines containing nonaluminum adjuvants<br>and the availability of nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine options,<br>selection of a nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine may be considered<br>in situations in which influenza vaccine and another vaccine<br>containing a nonaluminum adjuvant are to be administered<br>concomitantly. However, influenza vaccination should not be<br>delayed if a specific vaccine is not available. As recommended for<br>all vaccines, vaccines with nonaluminum adjuvants should be<br>administered at separate anatomic sites from other vaccines that</div>

<div class="text">the manufacturers of the vaccines. Information presented <br>concerning vaccines expected to be available and their approved <br>indications and usage reflects current knowledge and is subject <br>to change.<br>Various influenza vaccines will be available for the 2022–23 <br>season (Table 1). For many vaccine recipients, more than <br>one type or brand of vaccine might be appropriate within <br>approved indications and ACIP recommendations. A licensed <br>influenza vaccine that is appropriate for the recipient’s age <br>and health status should be used. Specific age indications for <br>licensed influenza vaccines are summarized (Table 1). Current <br>prescribing information should be consulted for authoritative, <br>up-to-date information. Contraindications and precautions</div>
<div class="text">for the different types of influenza vaccines are summarized <br>(Tables 2 and 3), as are dose volumes (Table 4).<br>Not all influenza vaccines are likely to be uniformly <br>available in any specific practice setting or geographic locality. <br>Vaccination should not be delayed to obtain a specific product <br>when an appropriate one is available. Within these guidelines <br>and approved indications, ACIP makes no preferential <br>recommendation for the use of any one influenza vaccine <br>over another when more than one licensed, recommended, <br>and age-appropriate vaccine is available, with the exception <br>of selection of influenza vaccines for persons aged ≥65 years <br>(see Older Adults).<br>Since the publication of the previous season’s <br>recommendations, FDA has approved a labeling change for <br>Flucelvax Quadrivalent (see Recent Influenza Vaccine Labeling <br>Changes).

Contraindications, and Precautions</div>
<div class="title">Quadrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (IIV4s)</div>
<div class="text">Available Vaccines. As in recent seasons, various inactivated <br>influenza vaccines (IIVs) are expected to be available for <br>2022–23 (Table 1); all are expected to be quadrivalent (IIV4s). <br>Standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4s are licensed for persons <br>aged as young as 6 months. However, for certain IIV4s, the <br>approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months <br>differs from that for older children and adults (Table 4). Two <br>IIV4s, the MF59-adjuvanted IIV4 (aIIV4) and the high-dose <br>IIV4 (HD-IIV4), are approved for persons aged ≥65 years. Care <br>should be taken to administer the appropriate dose volume of <br>an age-appropriate vaccine to each recipient.<br>Standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4s contain 15 µg of HA <br>per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose (7.5 µg of HA per vaccine <br>virus in a 0.25-mL dose). For 2022–23, this category is <br>expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1). Four of <br>these are egg-based vaccines, and one is a cell culture–based <br>vaccine. All are approved for persons aged ≥6 months. Egg-<br>based and cell culture–based vaccines differ in the substrate in <br>which reference vaccine viruses supplied to the manufacturer <br>are propagated in quantities sufficient to produce the needed <br>number of doses of vaccine. For the IIV4s Afluria Quadrivalent <br>(43), Fluarix Quadrivalent (123), FluLaval Quadrivalent (124), <br>and Fluzone Quadrivalent (44), reference vaccine viruses are</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<div class="text">propagated in eggs. For Flucelvax Quadrivalent, reference <br>vaccine viruses are propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney <br>cells instead of eggs (125).<br>Two additional IIV4s that will be available for the 2022–23 <br>season are approved for persons aged ≥65 years. These vaccines <br>are egg based. Quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza <br>vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent; HD-IIV4) contains <br>60 µg of HA per vaccine virus (240 µg total) in a 0.7-mL dose <br>(126). Quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine <br>(Fluad Quadrivalent; aIIV4) contains 15 µg of HA per vaccine <br>virus (60 µg total) and MF59 adjuvant (120).</div>
<div class="text">Dosage and Administration. Standard-dose nonadjuvanted <br>IIV4s are approved for children aged as young as 6 months. <br>Certain of these IIV4s are approved at different dose volumes <br>for very young children than for older children and adults. Care <br>should be taken to administer an age-appropriate vaccine at <br>the approved dose volume for each needed dose (see Children <br>Aged 6 Through 35 Months: Influenza Vaccine Dose Volumes) <br>(Tables 1 and 4):</div>
<div class="text">•	 Afluria Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume for <br>children aged 6 through 35 months is 0.25 mL per dose. <br>Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL <br>per dose.<br>•	 Fluarix Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL <br>per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months.<br>•	 Flucelvax Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume is <br>0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months.<br>•	 FluLaval Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume is <br>0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months.<br>•	 Fluzone Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume for <br>children aged 6 through 35 months is either 0.25 mL or <br>0.5 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) <br>should receive 0.5 mL per dose.</div>
<div class="text">p<br>If prefilled syringes are not available, the appropriate volume <br>can be administered from a single-dose or multidose vial. If <br>a 0.5-mL single-dose vial is used for a 0.25-mL dose for a <br>child aged 6 through 35 months, only half of the vial volume <br>should be administered, and the remaining half should be <br>discarded. Of note, dose volume is distinct from the number <br>of doses. Children in this age group who require 2 doses for <br>2022–23 need 2 separate doses administered ≥4 weeks apart, <br>regardless of the specific IIV4 used and volume given for each <br>dose (see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years: Number <br>of Influenza Vaccine Doses) (Figure).<br>For children aged 36 months (3 years) through 17 years and <br>adults aged ≥18 years, the dose volume for IIV4s is 0.5 mL per <br>dose, with the exception of Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent <br>(HD-IIV4, licensed for persons aged ≥65 years), for which <br>the correct volume is 0.7 mL per dose. If a smaller vaccine <br>dose (e.g., 0.25 mL) is inadvertently administered to a person</div>
<div class="text">aged ≥36 months, the remaining volume needed to make a full <br>dose should be administered during the same vaccination visit <br>or, if measuring the needed remaining volume is a challenge, <br>administering a repeat dose at the full volume is acceptable. <br>If the error is discovered later (after the recipient has left the <br>vaccination setting), a full dose should be administered as soon <br>as the recipient can return. Vaccination with a formulation <br>approved for adult use should be counted as a single dose if <br>inadvertently administered to a child.<br>IIV4s are administered intramuscularly (IM). For adults and <br>older children, the deltoid muscle is the preferred site. Infants <br>and younger children should be vaccinated in the anterolateral <br>thigh. Additional specific guidance regarding site selection and <br>needle length for IM injection is provided in the ACIP General <br>Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (42).<br>One IIV4, Afluria Quadrivalent, is licensed for IM injection <br>via the PharmaJet Stratis jet injector for persons aged 18 <br>through 64 years (43). Persons in this age group may receive <br>Afluria Quadrivalent via either needle and syringe or this <br>specific jet injection device. Children aged 6 months through <br>17 years and adults aged ≥65 years should receive this vaccine <br>by needle and syringe only. No other IIV4s are licensed for <br>administration by jet injector.</div>
<div class="text">Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of<br>IIV4s. Manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC<br>and ACIP guidance should be consulted for information on<br>contraindications and precautions for individual influenza<br>vaccines. Each IIV, whether egg-based or cell culture–based,<br>has a labeled contraindication for persons with a history of<br>a severe allergic reaction to any component of that vaccine<br>(Table 2). Although egg is a component of all IIV4s other<br>than ccIIV4, ACIP makes specific recommendations for<br>the use of influenza vaccine for persons with egg allergy<br>(see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). All egg-based<br>IIV4s are contraindicated in persons who have had a severe<br>allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any<br>influenza vaccine (any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of<br>any valency). Use of ccIIV4 is contraindicated in persons who<br>have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any<br>ccIIV of any valency. A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g.,<br>anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based<br>IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use<br>of ccIIV4 (see Persons with Previous Allergic Reactions to<br>Influenza Vaccines) (Tables 2 and 3). If ccIIV4 is administered<br>in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient<br>or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a<br>health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe<br>allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consultation with<br>an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible<br>for the reaction Information about vaccine components can</div>

<div class="text">be found in the package inserts for each vaccine. Prophylactic <br>use of antiviral agents is an option that can be considered <br>for preventing influenza among persons who cannot receive <br>vaccine, particularly for those who are at higher risk for medical <br>complications attributable to severe influenza (91).<br>Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever is <br>a general precaution for vaccination (42). A history of GBS <br>within 6 weeks after receipt of a previous dose of influenza <br>vaccine is considered a precaution for the use of all influenza <br>vaccines (Table 2).</div>
<div class="title">Quadrivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4)</div>
<div class="text">Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, <br>Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available <br>during the 2022–23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for <br>persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA <br>produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from <br>cell-derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the <br>use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).</div>
<div class="text">Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM <br>injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 µg <br>of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 µg total).<br>Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of RIV4. <br>RIV4 is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe <br>allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any <br>RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4. A history of a <br>severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza <br>vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency) <br>is a precaution for the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered <br>in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient <br>or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a <br>health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe <br>allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consulting with <br>an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible <br>for the reaction. Moderate or severe acute illness with or <br>without fever is a general precaution for vaccination (42). A <br>history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of a previous dose <br>of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for the use of all <br>influenza vaccines (Table 2). RIV4 is not licensed for children <br>aged <18 years</div>
<div class="title">Quadrivalent Live Attenuated Influenza 
Vaccine (LAIV4)</div>
<div class="text">Available Vaccine. One live attenuated influenza vaccine,<br>FluMist Quadrivalent (LAIV4), is expected to be available<br>during the 2022–23 influenza season. LAIV4 is approved<br>for persons aged 2 through 49 years. LAIV4 contains live<br>attenuated influenza viruses that are propagated in eggs. These<br>viruses are cold adapted (so that they replicate efficiently at<br>25°C) and temperature sensitive (so that their replication is</div>
<div class="text">restricted at higher temperatures, 39°C for influenza A viruses <br>and 37°C for influenza B viruses). These viruses replicate in <br>the nasopharynx, which is necessary to promote an immune <br>response (99). No preference is expressed for LAIV4 versus <br>other influenza vaccines used within specified indications.<br>Dosage and Administration. LAIV4 is administered <br>intranasally using the supplied prefilled, single-use sprayer <br>containing 0.2 mL of vaccine. Approximately 0.1 mL (i.e., half <br>of the total sprayer contents) is sprayed into the first nostril while <br>the recipient is in the upright position. An attached dose-divider <br>clip is removed from the sprayer to permit administration of the <br>second half of the dose into the other nostril. If the recipient <br>sneezes immediately after administration, the dose should <br>not be repeated. However, if nasal congestion is present that <br>might impede delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal <br>mucosa, deferral of administration should be considered until <br>resolution of the illness, or another appropriate vaccine should <br>be administered instead. Each total dose of 0.2 mL contains <br>106.5–7.5 fluorescent focus units of each vaccine virus (99).</div>
<div class="text">Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of LAIV4. <br>Conditions considered by ACIP to be contraindications and <br>precautions for the use of LAIV4 are summarized (Table 2). <br>These include two labeled contraindications that appear in <br>the package insert (99) and other conditions for which there <br>is uncertain but biologically plausible potential risk associated <br>with live viruses or limited data for use of LAIV.</div>
<div class="text">Contraindications to use of LAIV4 include the following:<br>•	 Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component <br>of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine<br>(i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency;<br>a labeled contraindication noted in the package insert).<br>However, ACIP makes an exception for allergy to egg (see<br>Persons with a History of Egg Allergy).<br>•	 Children and adolescents receiving concomitant aspirin- or<br>salicylate-containing medications, because of the potential<br>risk for Reye syndrome (a labeled contraindication noted<br>in the package insert).<br>•	 Children aged 2 through 4 years who have received a <br>diagnosis of asthma or whose parents or caregivers report<br>that a health care provider has told them during the <br>preceding 12 months that their child had wheezing or<br>asthma or whose medical record indicates a wheezing <br>episode has occurred during the preceding 12 months.<br>•	 Children and adults who are immunocompromised due to<br>any cause, including but not limited to immunosuppression<br>caused by medications, congenital or acquired</div>

<div class="title">Recent Influenza Vaccine Labeling Changes
Flucelvax Quadrivalent</div>
<div class="text">Since the publication of the 2021–22 ACIP influenza vaccine <br>recommendations, a labeling change for Flucelvax Quadrivalent <br>(ccIIV4) has occurred. Flucelvax Quadrivalent was initially <br>approved in 2016 for persons aged ≥4 years. Approval for persons <br>aged ≥18 years was based on a randomized immunogenicity <br>and safety trial that compared Flucelvax Quadrivalent with the <br>previously approved trivalent formulation of Flucelvax (ccIIV3), <br>which had previously been licensed for persons aged ≥18 years <br>on the basis of data from a randomized clinical efficacy trial. <br>Approval for children aged 4 through 17 years also was based on <br>immunogenicity and safety data compared with ccIIV3, with a <br>postmarketing requirement to conduct a clinical efficacy study <br>(128). In March 2021, FDA approved Flucelvax Quadrivalent <br>for persons aged ≥2 years on the basis of a randomized clinical</div>
<div class="text">efficacy trial conducted among 4,514 children aged ≥2 to <br><18 years over three influenza seasons (Southern Hemisphere <br>2017 and Northern Hemisphere 2017–18 and 2018–19) (129).<br>Subsequently, in October 2021, FDA approved Flucelvax <br>Quadrivalent for persons aged ≥6 months. Approval was based <br>on a randomized immunogenicity and safety study conducted <br>among 2,402 children aged 6 through 47 months (of whom 894 <br>were aged 6 through 23 months). Children were randomized <br>in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Flucelvax Quadrivalent <br>(0.5 mL/dose containing 15 µg HA per virus for all ages) or a <br>licensed comparator egg-based IIV4 (0.25 mL/dose containing <br>7.5 µg HA per virus for those aged 6 through 35 months and <br>0.5 mL/dose containing 15 µg HA per virus for those aged <br>36 through 47 months) (130). Flucelvax Quadrivalent met <br>prespecified immunogenicity criteria for all four viruses. No new <br>safety signals were noted, and prevalence of solicited injection <br>site and systemic reactions was similar between the two groups.</div>
<div class="title">Storage and Handling of 
Influenza Vaccines</div>
<div class="text">In all instances, approved manufacturer packaging information <br>should be consulted for authoritative guidance concerning storage <br>and handling of specific influenza vaccines. Typically, influenza <br>vaccines should be protected from light and stored at temperatures <br>that are recommended in the package insert. Recommended <br>storage temperatures are typically 36°F–46°F (2°C–8°C) and <br>should be maintained at all times with adequate refrigeration <br>and temperature monitoring. Vaccine that has frozen should be <br>discarded. Specific recommendations for appropriate refrigerators <br>and temperature monitoring equipment can be found in the <br>Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit, available at https://www.<br>cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/index.html.<br>Vaccines should not be used beyond the expiration date on <br>the label. In addition to the expiration date, multidose vials also <br>might have a beyond-use date (BUD), which specifies the number <br>of days the vaccine can be kept once first accessed. After being <br>accessed for the first dose, multidose vials should not be used after <br>the BUD. If no BUD is provided, then the listed expiration date <br>is to be used. Multidose vials should be returned to recommended <br>storage conditions between uses. Package information might also <br>specify a maximum number of doses contained in multidose vials <br>(regardless of remaining volume). No more than the specified <br>number of doses should be removed, and any remainder should <br>be discarded. Single-dose vials should not be accessed for more <br>than 1 dose. Providers should contact the manufacturer for <br>information on permissible temperature excursions and other <br>departures from recommended storage and handling conditions <br>that are not discussed in the package labeling.</div>

<div class="title">Disclosure of Relationship and Unlabeled Use</div>
<div class="text">All authors have completed and submitted the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors form for the disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. <br>Helen Keipp Talbot reports receiving financial support from CDC. No other potential conflicts of interest were disclosed. This report includes discussion of <br>the unlabeled use of influenza vaccines in the instance of influenza vaccination of persons with a history of egg allergy. A history of severe allergic reaction <br>(e.g., anaphylaxis) to the vaccine or any of its components (which include egg for certain vaccines) is a labeled contraindication to receipt of most IIV4s <br>and LAIV4. However, ACIP recommends that persons with a history of allergic reaction of any severity to egg should receive any licensed, recommended <br>influenza vaccine that is appropriate for their age and health status. Persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to egg who receive egg-based vaccines (i.e., <br>vaccines other than cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine [ccIIV4] or recombinant influenza vaccine [RIV4]) should be vaccinated in an inpatient <br>or outpatient medical setting (including, but not necessarily limited to, hospitals, clinics, health departments, and physician offices); vaccine administration <br>in such instances should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. No postvaccination waiting <br>period is recommended specifically for egg-allergic persons. However, ACIP recommends that vaccine providers consider observing patients seated or supine <br>for 15 minutes after administration of any vaccine (regardless of allergy history) to decrease the risk for injury should syncope occur.</div>
