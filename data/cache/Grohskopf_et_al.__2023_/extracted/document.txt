Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose for the season and for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester if vaccine is available during those months. Updates described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP that were held on October 20, 2021; January 12, 2022; February 23, 2022; and June 22, 2022. Primary updates to this report include the following three topics: 1) the composition of 2022-23 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 2) updates to the description of influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2022-23 season, including one influenza vaccine labeling change that occurred after the publication of the 2021-22 ACIP influenza recommendations; and 3) updates to the recommendations concerning vaccination of adults aged ≥65 years. First, the composition of 2022-23 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A (H3 N2) and influenza B/Victoria lineage components. U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1 N1) pdm 09 like virus (for egg based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1 N1) pdm 09 like virus (for cell

During the severe 2017-18 season, notable for an unusually long duration of widespread high influenza activity throughout the United States and higher rates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations compared with recent seasons, vaccination prevented an estimated 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109 000 hospitalizations, and 8,000 deaths (14), despite an overall estimated vaccine effectiveness of 38% (62% against influenza A[H1 N1]pdm09 viruses, 22% against influenza A[H3 N2] viruses, and 50%

Introduction Influenza viruses typically circulate annually in the United States, most commonly from the late fall through the early spring. Most persons who become ill after influenza virus infection recover without serious complications or sequelae. However, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults, very young children, pregnant persons, and persons of all ages with certain chronic medical conditions (1-7). Influenza also is an important cause of missed work and school (8-10). Routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contra indications has been recommended by CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2010 (11). Vaccination provides important protection from influenza illness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors, such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages (for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine (12). During each of the six influenza seasons from

While waning of immunity after vaccination over the course of the season has been observed among all age groups (19 32, there are fewer published studies reporting results specifically among children (19 22. Moreover, children in this group might visit health care providers during the late summer months for medical examinations before the start of school. Vaccination can be considered at this time because it represents a vaccination opportunity. • Pregnant persons in the third trimester: Vaccination during July and August can be considered for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester because vaccination might reduce risk for influenza illness in their infants during the first months after birth, when they are too young to receive influenza vaccine (33 36. For pregnant persons in the first or second trimester during July and August, waiting to vaccinate until September or October is preferable, unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. Community vaccination programs should balance maximizing the likelihood of persistence of vaccine induced protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation occurs. Efforts should be structured to optimize vaccination coverage before influenza activity in the community begins. Vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for

In addition to the factors observed to be associated with waning immunity across studies, observed decreases in protection might be at least in

Certain studies suggest waning occurs to a greater degree against influenza A (H3 N2) viruses than against influenza A (H1 N1) or influenza B viruses (26 27. This effect also might vary with recipient age; in certain studies, waning was more pronounced among older adults (19 23 26 30 32 and younger children (19). Relatively fewer reports include results specific to children (19 22; findings suggestive of waning have been reported in certain studies (19 21 but not others (22). Rates of decline in vaccine effectiveness also varied. A multi season (2011-12 through 2014 15 analysis from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu VE) Network found that vaccine effectiveness decreased by approximately 7% per month for influenza A (H3 N2) and influenza B and 6 11 per month for influenza A (H1 N1) pdm09 (25). Vaccine effectiveness remained greater than zero for at least 5-6 months after vaccination. In the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAI VEN during the 2015-16 through 2018-19 seasons, vaccine effectiveness against influenza associated hospitalizations declined by approximately 8%-9% per month for all adults and approximately 10 11 per month for those aged ≥65 years (32). An analysis of the 2010-11 through 2013-14 seasons noted estimated effectiveness ranging from 54% to 67% during days 0-180 post vaccination; estimated vaccine effectiveness was not significant during the period between days 181 and 365 (20). A third multi season analysis (2010-11 through 2014 15 conducted in Europe noted a decline in vaccine effectiveness to 0% at 111 days post vaccination against influenza A (H3 N2) viruses. Vaccine effectiveness against influenza B viruses decreased more slowly, and vaccine effectiveness against influenza A (H1 N1) pdm09 viruses remained roughly stable at 50 55 throughout the influenza season (27).

Although vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has already begun, might be beneficial in most influenza seasons. Providers should offer influenza vaccination to un vaccinated persons who have already become ill with influenza during the season because the vaccine might protect them against other circulating influenza viruses. Guidance for Influenza Vaccination in Specific Populations and Situations Populations at Higher Risk for Medical Complications Attributable to Severe Influenza All persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contra indications should be vaccinated annually.

In this model, during an influenza season beginning in October and peaking in January, delaying vaccination until October resulted in more hospitalizations if >14% of persons aged ≥65 years who would have been vaccinated in August or September failed to get vaccinated. However, these predictions varied considerably with assumed timing of season onset, rate of waning immunity, and vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination efforts should continue throughout the season because the duration of the influenza season varies, and influenza activity might not occur in certain communities until February, March, or later.

Persons Who Live with or Care for Persons at Higher Risk for Influenza-Related Complications All persons aged ≥6 months without contra indications should be vaccinated annually. However, emphasis also should be placed on vaccination of persons who live with or care for those who are at increased risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on administering vaccination to persons at higher risk for influenza related complications as well as persons who live with or care for such persons, including the following: • Health care personnel, including all paid and unpaid persons working in health care settings who have the potential for exposure to patients or to infectious materials. These personnel might include but are not limited to physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, therapists, technicians, emergency medical service personnel dental personnel pharmacists laboratory

volunteers). ACIP guidance for vaccination of health care personnel has been published previously (40). • Household contacts (including children aged ≥6 months) and caregivers of children aged ≤59 months (<5 years) and adults aged ≥50 years, particularly contacts of children aged <6 months. • Household contacts (including children aged ≥6 months) and caregivers of persons with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza. Health care personnel and persons who are contacts of persons in these groups (with the exception of contacts of severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment) may receive any influenza vaccine that is otherwise indicated. Persons who care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment should not receive LAIV4. ACIP and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) have previously recommended that health care personnel who receive LAIV should avoid providing care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment for 7 days after vaccination and that hospital visitors who have received LAIV should avoid contact with such persons for 7 days after vaccination (41). However, such persons need not be restricted from caring for or visiting less severely immunocompromised persons. Influenza Vaccination of Persons with COVID-19 Vaccination of persons who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who are in quarantine after an exposure should include multiple considerations, such as whether bringing the person into a vaccination setting could expose others to COVID-19, whether the person is acutely ill and the severity of the illness, the presence of risk factors for severe influenza illness, the likelihood of being able to vaccinate at a later date, and the desire to avoid confusing post vaccination symptoms with those of COVID-19. Usually, persons who are in quarantine or isolation should not be brought to a vaccination setting if doing so could expose others to COVID-19. For those who have moderate or severe COVID-19, vaccination should usually be deferred until they have recovered, which is consistent with ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (42). For persons who have mild or a symptomatic COVID-19, further defer ral might be considered to avoid confusing COVID-19 symptoms with post vaccination reactions. Because recommendations for vaccination of this population might continue to evolve, clinicians should check CDC guidance (https www cdc gov vaccines pandemic guidance index html

However, in a larger VSD follow up study, IIV was not associated with an increased risk for miscarriage during the 2012-13, 2013-14, and 2014-15 seasons, regardless of previous season vaccination (63). Substantially less experience exists with more recently licensed IIVs (e.g., quad rival ent and cell culture based vaccines) during pregnancy than with previously available products. For RIV (available as RIV3 from 2013-14 through 2017-18 and as RIV4 since 2017 18, data are limited to reports of pregnancies occurring incidentally during clinical trials, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports, and pregnancy registries. Pregnancy registries and surveillance studies exist for certain products, for which information can be found in package inserts.

Early vaccination (i.e., during July and August) can be considered for persons who are in the third trimester during these months if vaccine is available because this can provide protection for the infant during the first months of life when they are too young to be vaccinated. Although experience with the use of IIVs during pregnancy is substantial, data specifically reflecting administration of influenza vaccines during the first trimester are limited (see Safety of Influenza Vaccines in the supplementary Background Document). Most studies have not noted an association between influenza vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) (51 61. One observational

The adjuvant ed vaccine contains 15 µg of HA per virus, similarly to non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59. HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs against laboratory confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66 68 and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code defined (rather than laboratory confirmed outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69 79. Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza associated hospitalizations.

No data are available from randomized trials evaluating prevention of laboratory confirmed influenza associated hospitalizations as a primary outcome. In a secondary analysis from a two season randomized trial of HD-IIV3 versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV3 assessing serious adverse events (SAEs) (including hospitalizations associated with laboratory confirmation of influenza performed outside of the study (82) and apost hoc analysis of pneumonia- and influenza related hospitalizations from a randomized study of HD-IIV3 versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV4 (83), there was no difference in risk for these events between the two groups (certainty level: 2, moderate). However, additional data are available from two single season, cluster randomized studies conducted among U.S. nursing homes (in which nursing homes were randomized to vaccine groups rather than individual persons) that examined prevention of pneumonia and influenza diagnostic coded hospitalizations. One such study noted a benefit of HD-IIV3

Randomized Studies Comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with Non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs: Prevention of Influenza Illnesses. Randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs against laboratory confirmed influenza illness are few in number and were conducted over few influenza seasons. HD-IIV3 was more effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or culture confirmed influenza like illness (ILI) in a two season randomized study conducted among 32 000 persons aged ≥65 years (relative efficacy: 24%; 95% CI: 10 36; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single season randomized trials of RIV versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV3 that assessed culture confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV4 that examined PCRconfirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged ≥65 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: −17% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate). The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over non adjuvant ed SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged ≥50 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10 47 as well i lfi d ILI h d 65

Persons with a History of Guill a in Barré Syndrome After Influenza Vaccination A history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of a previous dose of any type of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for influenza vaccination (Table 2). Persons who are not at higher risk for severe influenza complications (see Populations at Higher Risk for Medical Complications Attributable to Severe Influenza) and who are known to have experienced GBS within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination typically should not be vaccinated. As an alternative to vaccination, providers might consider using influenza

Timing of vaccination might be a consideration (e.g., vaccinating during a period either before or after an immu no compromising intervention). The Infectious Diseases Society of America has published detailed guidance for the selection and timing of vaccines for persons with specific immu no compromising conditions (90). Immune response to influenza vaccines might be blunted in persons with certain conditions, such as congenital immune deficiencies, and in persons receiving cancer chemotherapy or immuno suppress ive medications

Immunocompromised Persons ACIP recommends that persons with compromised immunity (including but not limited to persons with congenital and acquired immunodeficiency states, persons who are immunocompromised due to medications, and persons with anatomic and functional asp len i a) should receive an age appropriate IIV4 or RIV4. ACIP recommends that LAIV4 not be used for these groups because of the uncertain but biologically plausible risk for disease attributable to the live vaccine virus. Use of LAIV4 in persons with these and other conditions is discussed in more detail (see Dosage, Administration, Contra indications, and Precautions) (Table 2). Immunocompromised states comprise a heterogeneous range of conditions with varying risks for severe infections.

However, the benefits of influenza vaccination might outweigh the possible risks for certain persons who have a history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of influenza vaccine and who also are at higher risk for severe complications from influenza. Persons with a History of Egg Allergy Most available influenza vaccines, with the exceptions of RIV4 (Flublok Quad rival ent, licensed for those aged ≥18 years) and ccIIV4 (Flu cel vax Quad rival ent, licensed for those aged ≥6 months), are prepared by propagation of virus in embryonated eggs and might contain trace amounts of egg proteins, such as oval bum in. For persons who report a history of egg allergy, ACIP recommends the following: • Persons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only urticaria (hives) after exposure to egg should receive influenza vaccine. Any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any IIV4, RIV4, or LAIV4) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient sage and health status can be used. • Persons who report having had reactions to egg involving symptoms other than urticaria (e.g., an gi oedema or swelling, respiratory distress, lightheaded ness, or recurrent vomiting) or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention can similarly receive any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any IIV4, RIV4, or LAIV4) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status. If a vaccine other than ccIIV4 or RIV4 is used, the selected vaccine should be administered in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting, including but not necessarily limited to hospitals, clinics, health departments, and physician offices. Vaccine administration should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. All vaccination providers should be familiar with their office emergency plan and be certified in cardiopulmonary

precaution for the use of ccIIV4. If ccIIV4 is administered in such instances, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers also can consider consultation with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction. ű A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency or to any component of ccIIV4 is a contra indication to future receipt of ccIIV4. • For RIV4: ű A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered in such instances, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions.

However, severe allergic reactions, lthough rare, can occur after influenza vaccination, even mong persons with no previous reactions or known allergies. Although vaccine components can be found in package inserts, dent if ying the causative component without further evaluation i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can be difficult. Severe allergic reactions after vaccination with n RIV have been reported to VAERS, some of which have occurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions oegg or to influenza vaccines and which might represent a predisposition to development of allergic manifestations in ffected persons (92 94. Because these rare but severe allergic eactions can occur, ACIP recommends the following for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of an influenza vaccine (Table 3): • For egg based IIV4 s and LAIV4: ű A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a contra indication to future receipt of all egg based IIV4 s and LAIV4. Each individual egg based IIV4 and LAIV4 is also contra indicated for persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of that vaccine (excluding egg) (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). • For ccIIV4: ű A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of ccIIV4.

a reasonable assumption is that that peramivir might interfere with the mechanism of LAIV4 if administered from 5 days before through 2 weeks after vaccination and baloxavir might interfere if administered from 17 days before through 2 weeks after vaccination. The interval between influenza anti viral receipt and LAIV4 during which interference might occur could be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Persons who receive these medications during these periods before or after receipt of LAIV4 should be revaccinated with another appropriate influenza vaccine (e.g., IIV4 or RIV4). Administration of Influenza Vaccines with Other Vaccines IIV4 s and RIV4 may be administered simultaneously or sequentially with other in activated vaccines or live vaccines. Inject able vaccines that are given concomitantly should be administered at separate anatomic sites. LAIV4 can be administered simultaneously with other live or in activated vaccines. However, if two live vaccines are not given simultaneously, at least 4 weeks should pass after administration of one live vaccine (such as LAIV4) before another live vaccine is administered (42).

However, the newer influenza anti virals peramivir and baloxavir have longer half lives than oseltamivir and zanamivir, approximately 20 hours for peramivir (100) and 79 hours for baloxavir (101), and could interfere with the replication of LAIV4 if administered >48 hours before vaccination.

PPSV23 (109 110; tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and a cellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine among adults (108); and Tdap in pregnancy (111). Although increased prevalence of injection site or systemic adverse reactions has been noted with concurrent administration in certain studies, these symptoms have usually been reported to be mild or moderate. Among children aged 6 through 23 months, co administration of IIV3 and PCV13 was associated with increased risk for fever on the day of vaccination and the day after (i.e., days 0-1 post vaccination) in an observational study conducted during the 2011-12 season (112). A randomized clinical trial during the 2017-18 influenza season suggested that delaying IIV4 administration by 2 weeks in children receiving diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and a cellular pertussis (DTaP)

p g g ppostvaccination was similar between the co administration group and the group that received the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine alone; reactogenicity rates in the group receiving HD-IIV4 alone were lower. No SAEs were observed. Immune response was similar between the mRNA COVID-19 and co administration groups (103). Relatively limited data are available on the concomitant administration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines. Studies of live attenuated zoster vaccine and IIV3 (104) or IIV4 (105) among persons aged ≥50 years noted similar antibody responses whether the two vaccines were administered concomitantly or 4 weeks apart. In certain studies, reduced responses have been noted to 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) (106 107, tetanus antigens (108), and pertussis antigens (108) when co administered with IIV3 to adults; in most instances, the clinical significance of this is uncertain. Simultaneous administration of IIV4 and 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) to persons aged ≥65 years was associated with lower seroprotection rates to one influenza B antigen at 4-6 weeks post vaccination compared with sequential administration 2 weeks apart. Seroprotection was not significantly different between the two groups for any of the four influenza antigens at 6 months post vaccination (109). Reassuring safety profiles have been noted for simultaneous administration of IIVs with live attenuated zoster vaccine (104 105; PCV13 (106 107; PPSV23 (109 110; tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid,

y, COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines that might be more likely to cause an injection site reaction (e.g., aIIV4 or HD-IIV4) should be administered in different limbs, if possible. In an interim analysis of a study of concomitant administration of HD-IIV4 and a booster dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (administered in separate upper arm sites) compared with administration of either vaccine alone among 296 persons aged ≥65 years, overall reactogenicity up to 7 days

has been studied, and no evidence of decreased immunogen i city or safety concerns was noted (122). The immunogen i city and safety of simultaneous or sequential administration of two non alum in um adjuvant-containing vaccines have not been evaluated, and the ideal interval between such vaccines when given sequentially is not known. In the study of Shin grix and IIV4 (122), most reactogenicity symptoms resolved within 4 days. Because of the limited data on the safety of simultaneous administration of two or more vaccines containing non alum in um adjuvants and the availability of non adjuvant ed influenza vaccine options, selection of an on adjuvant ed influenza vaccine may be considered in situations in which influenza vaccine and another vaccine containing an on alum in um adjuvant are to be administered concomitantly. However, influenza vaccination should not be delayed if a specific vaccine is not available. As recommended for all vaccines, vaccines with non alum in um adjuvants should be administered at separate anatomic sites from other vaccines that are given concomitantly (42).

been noted within days 0-1 after co administration of IIV with PCV7, PCV13, or DTaP vaccines during the 2006-07 through 2010-11 seasons (114) and with PCV13 during the 2014-15 season (115). Although concerning to parents, most febrile seizures are brief and have agood prognosis (116). After considering the risks and benefits, no changes in the recommendations for administration of these vaccines were made. Surveillance of febrile seizures is ongoing through VAERS, and the VSD annual influenza safety surveillance includes monitoring for seizures after vaccinations. Studies of concomitant administration of LAIV with other vaccines are limited. Concurrent administration of LAIV3 with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccine to children was not associated with diminished immunogen i city of antigens in any of the vaccines in one study (117); diminished response to rubella was observed in another study examining co administration of LAIV3 and MMR (118). No safety concerns were noted in these studies. In recent years, several vaccines containing non alum in um adjuvants have been licensed for use in the United States for the prevention of various infectious diseases. These include AS01 B (in Shin grix, recombinant zoster subunit vaccine) (119), MF59 (in Fluad Quad rival ent [aIIV4]) (120), and cytosine phosphoguanine oli god eoxy nucleotide (in Heplisav-B, a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine) (121).

Quad rival ent adjuvanted in activated influenza vaccine (Fluad Quad rival ent; aIIV4) contains 15 µg of HA per vaccine virus (60 µg total) and MF59 adjuvant (120). Dosage and Administration. Standard dose nonadjuvanted IIV4 s are approved for children aged as young as 6 months. Certain of these IIV4 s are approved at different dose volumes for very young children than for older children and adults. Care should be taken to administer an age appropriate vaccine at the approved dose volume for each needed dose (see Children Aged 6 Through 35 Months: Influenza Vaccine Dose Volumes) (Tables 1 and 4): • Afluria Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is 0.25 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. • Fluarix Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. • Flu cel vax Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. • FluLaval Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. • Flu zone Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. If pre filled syringes are not available, the appropriate volume can be administered from a single dose or multi dose vial. If a 0.5-mL single dose vial is used for a 0.25-mL dose for a child aged 6 through 35 months, only half of the vial volume should be administered, and the remaining half should be discarded.

If the error is discovered later (after the recipient has left the vaccination setting), afull dose should be administered as soon as the recipient can return. Vaccination with a formulation approved for adult use should be counted as a single dose if inadvertently administered to a child. IIV4 s are administered intramuscularly (IM). For adults and older children, the deltoid muscle is the preferred site. Infants and younger children should be vaccinated in the an ter ola ter al thigh. Additional specific guidance regarding site selection and needle length for IM injection is provided in the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (42).

Storage and Handling of Influenza Vaccines In all instances, approved manufacturer packaging information should be consulted for authoritative guidance concerning storage and handling of specific influenza vaccines. Typically, influenza vaccines should be protected from light and stored at temperatures that are recommended in the package insert. Recommended storage temperatures are typically 36°F-46°F (2°C-8°C) and should be maintained at all times with adequate refrigeration

efficacy trial conducted among 4,514 children aged ≥2 to <18 years over three influenza seasons (Southern Hemisphere 2017 and Northern Hemisphere 2017-18 and 2018 19 (129). Subsequently, in October 2021, FDA approved Flu cel vax Quad rival ent for persons aged ≥6 months. Approval was based on a randomized immunogen i city and safety study conducted among 2,402 children aged 6 through 47 months (of whom 894 were aged 6 through 23 months). Children were randomized n a 2:1 ratio to receive either Flu cel vax Quad rival ent (0.5 mL/dose containing 15 µg HA per virus for all ages) or aicensed comparator egg based IIV4 (0.25 mL/dose containing 7.5 µg HA per virus for those aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL/dose containing 15 µg HA per virus for those aged 36 through 47 months) (130). Flu cel vax Quad rival ent met pre specified immunogen i city criteria for all four viruses. No new safety signals were noted, and prevalence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions was similar between the two groups.
