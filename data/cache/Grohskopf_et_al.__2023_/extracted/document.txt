through 8 years need 2 doses; these children should receive the first dose as soon as possible after vaccine is available, including 
during July and August. Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose for 
the season and for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester if vaccine is available during those months.
Updates described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP that were held on October 20, 2021; 
January 12, 2022; February 23, 2022; and June 22, 2022. Primary updates to this report include the following three topics: 
1) the composition of 2022–23 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 2) updates to the description of influenza vaccines expected 
to be available for the 2022–23 season, including one influenza vaccine labeling change that occurred after the publication of 
the 2021–22 ACIP influenza recommendations; and 3) updates to the recommendations concerning vaccination of adults aged 
≥65 years. First, the composition of 2022–23 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H3N2) and influenza 
B/Victoria lineage components. U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 
(H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell

influenza vaccines are no longer available, but data that involve these vaccines are included for reference.
Influenza vaccines might be available as early as July or August, but for most persons who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccin

Summary
This report updates the 2021–22 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) concerning 
the use of seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States (MMWR Recomm Rep 2021;70[No. RR-5]:1–24). Routine annual 
influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. For each recipient, 
a licensed and age-appropriate vaccine should be used. With the exception of vaccination for adults aged ≥65 years, ACIP 
makes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate 
vaccine is available. All seasonal influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2022–23 season are 
quadrivalent, containing hemagglutinin (HA) derived from one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, one influenza A(H3N2) virus, 
one influenza B/Victoria lineage virus and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s)

2010–11 through 2015–16, influenza vaccination prevented 
an estimated 1.6–6.7 million illnesses, 790,000–3.1 million 
outpatient medical visits, 39,000–87,000 hospitalizations, and 
3,000–10,000 respiratory and circulatory deaths each season 
in the United States (13). During the severe 2017–18 season, 
notable for an unusually long duration of widespread high 
influenza activity throughout the United States and higher 
rates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations compared with 
recent seasons, vaccination prevented an estimated 7.1 million 
illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, 
and 8,000 deaths (14), despite an overall estimated vaccine 
effectiveness of 38% (62% against influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 
viruses, 22% against influenza A[H3N2] viruses, and 50%

Introduction
Influenza viruses typically circulate annually in the United
States, most commonly from the late fall through the early
spring. Most persons who become ill after influenza virus
infection recover without serious complications or sequelae.
However, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses,
hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults,
very young children, pregnant persons, and persons of all ages
with certain chronic medical conditions (1–7). Influenza also is
an important cause of missed work and school (8–10). Routine
annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months
who do not have contraindications has been recommended by
CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) since 2010 (11).
Vaccination provides important protection from influenza
illness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of
influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors,
such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine
administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages
(for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree
of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in
the vaccine (12) During each of the six influenza seasons from

2022–23 influenza season in the United States. A brief summar

Routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged 
≥6 months who do not have contraindications continues to be 
recommended. Primary updates in this report include the following:
1.	 The composition of the 2022–23 U.S. seasonal influenza 
vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H3N2) 
and influenza B/Victoria components. For the 2022–23 
season, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain 
hemagglutinin (HA) derived from an influenza 
A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-
based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 
(H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture–based and 
recombinant vaccines); an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 
(H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an 
influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell 
culture–based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza 
B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus; 
and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata 
lineage)-like virus.
2.	 Influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2022–23 
season, their age indications, and their presentations are 
described (Table 1). Afluria Quadrivalent is not expected 
to be available in a 0.25-mL prefilled syringe presentation. 
When using Afluria Quadrivalent for children aged 
6 through 35 months (who require a 0.25-mL dose), the 
dose must be obtained from a multidose vial. One labeling 
change is described. In October 2021, FDA granted 
approval for the use of Flucelvax Quadrivalent (cell culture–
based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [ccIIV4]) 
for children aged 6 months through <2 years. As of March 
2021, Flucelvax Quadrivalent had been approved for 
persons aged ≥2 years. Approval for children aged 6 months 
through <2 years was based on results of a randomized, 
observer-blind study that compared immunogenicity and 
safety of Flucelvax Quadrivalent with that of a licensed 
comparator IIV4 among 2,402 children aged 6 through 
47 months, of whom 894 were aged 6 through 23 months.

(RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza
vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is availabl
at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any
other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used
Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both
of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per viru
than standard-dose vaccines (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and
45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard-dose
inactivated vaccines). Adjuvanted inactivated influenza
vaccine (aIIV4) contains MF59 adjuvant.

Influenza Vaccines, 2022–23

vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must 
be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by 
the end of October.
•	 Children who require only 1 dose: Vaccination during 
July and August can be considered for children of any age 
who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season. 
While waning of immunity after vaccination over the 
course of the season has been observed among all age 
groups (19–32), there are fewer published studies reporting 
results specifically among children (19–22). Moreover, 
children in this group might visit health care providers 
during the late summer months for medical examinations 
before the start of school. Vaccination can be considered 
at this time because it represents a vaccination opportunity.
•	 Pregnant persons in the third trimester: Vaccination 
during July and August can be considered for pregnant 
persons who are in the third trimester because vaccination 
might reduce risk for influenza illness in their infants 
during the first months after birth, when they are too 
young to receive influenza vaccine (33–36). For pregnant 
persons in the first or second trimester during July and 
August, waiting to vaccinate until September or October 
is preferable, unless there is concern that later vaccination 
might not be possible.
Community vaccination programs should balance 
maximizing the likelihood of persistence of vaccine-induced 
protection through the season with avoiding missed 
opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of 
nfluenza circulation occurs. Efforts should be structured to 
optimize vaccination coverage before influenza activity in the 
community begins. Vaccination should continue to be offered 
as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired 
vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for

trimester: Vaccination during July and August should be
avoided unless there is concern that vaccination later in
the season might not be possible.
•	 Children who require 2 doses: Certain children aged
6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza
vaccine for the season (see Children Aged 6 Months
Through 8 Years: Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses)

made for revaccination (i.e., providing a booster dose) later

was received.

*	Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses of influenza 
vaccine should receive their first dose as soon as possible (including during 
July and August, if vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must 
be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October. 
For children aged 8 years who require 2 doses of vaccine, both doses should 
be administered even if the child turns age 9 years between receipt of dose 1 
and dose 2.

found a significant decline in effectiveness within 180 days 
after vaccination against influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B 
but not against influenza A(H1N1) (38). In addition to the 
factors observed to be associated with waning immunity across 
studies, observed decreases in protection might be at least in

Certain studies suggest waning occurs to a greater degree
against influenza A(H3N2) viruses than against influenza
A(H1N1) or influenza B viruses (26,27). This effect also
might vary with recipient age; in certain studies, waning
was more pronounced among older adults (19,23,26,30,32)
and younger children (19). Relatively fewer reports include
results specific to children (19–22); findings suggestive of
waning have been reported in certain studies (19–21) but
not others (22). Rates of decline in vaccine effectiveness also
varied. A multiseason (2011–12 through 2014–15) analysis
from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu
VE) Network found that vaccine effectiveness decreased by
approximately 7% per month for influenza A(H3N2) and
influenza B and 6%–11% per month for influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 (25). Vaccine effectiveness remained greater than zero
for at least 5–6 months after vaccination. In the Hospitalized
Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN)
during the 2015–16 through 2018–19 seasons, vaccine
effectiveness against influenza-associated hospitalizations
declined by approximately 8%–9% per month for all adults
and approximately 10%–11% per month for those aged
≥65 years (32). An analysis of the 2010–11 through 2013–14
seasons noted estimated effectiveness ranging from 54% to
67% during days 0–180 postvaccination; estimated vaccine
effectiveness was not significant during the period between
days 181 and 365 (20). A third multiseason analysis (2010–11
through 2014–15) conducted in Europe noted a decline
in vaccine effectiveness to 0% at 111 days postvaccination
against influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Vaccine effectiveness
against influenza B viruses decreased more slowly, and vaccine
effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses
remained roughly stable at 50%–55% throughout the influenza
season (27). A meta-analysis of 14 studies examining waning

and for influenza-related outpatient, emergency department, 
or hospital visits. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination

vaccine routinely, and organized vaccination campaigns should
continue throughout the influenza season, including after
influenza activity has begun in the community. Although
vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine
administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has
already begun, might be beneficial in most influenza seasons.
Providers should offer influenza vaccination to unvaccinated
persons who have already become ill with influenza during the
season because the vaccine might protect them against other
circulating influenza viruses.
Guidance for Influenza Vaccination in 
Specific Populations and Situations
Populations at Higher Risk for Medical 
Complications Attributable to Severe Influenza
All persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications
should be vaccinated annually. However, vaccination to prevent
influenza is particularly important for persons who are at
increased risk for severe illness and complications from influenza

simulated mathematical model examining various scenarios
of vaccination timing, timing of onset of the influenza season,
vaccine effectiveness, and rate of waning (39). In this model,
during an influenza season beginning in October and peaking
in January, delaying vaccination until October resulted in
more hospitalizations if >14% of persons aged ≥65 years who
would have been vaccinated in August or September failed to
get vaccinated. However, these predictions varied considerably
with assumed timing of season onset, rate of waning immunity,
and vaccine effectiveness.
Vaccination efforts should continue throughout the season
because the duration of the influenza season varies, and
influenza activity might not occur in certain communities
until February, March, or later. Providers should offer influenza

Persons Who Live with or Care for Persons at 
Higher Risk for Influenza-Related Complications
All persons aged ≥6 months without contraindications
hould be vaccinated annually. However, emphasis also should
be placed on vaccination of persons who live with or care for
hose who are at increased risk for medical complications
ttributable to severe influenza. When vaccine supply is
imited, vaccination efforts should focus on administering
vaccination to persons at higher risk for influenza-related
omplications as well as persons who live with or care for such
persons, including the following:
•	 Health care personnel, including all paid and unpaid persons
working in health care settings who have the potential for
exposure to patients or to infectious materials. These

r up-to-date information.

However, such persons need not be restricted from caring for 
or visiting less severely immunocompromised persons.
Influenza Vaccination of Persons with COVID-19
Vaccination of persons who have tested positive for COVID-19 
or who are in quarantine after an exposure should include 
multiple considerations, such as whether bringing the person 
into a vaccination setting could expose others to COVID-19, 
whether the person is acutely ill and the severity of the illness, the 
presence of risk factors for severe influenza illness, the likelihood 
of being able to vaccinate at a later date, and the desire to avoid 
confusing postvaccination symptoms with those of COVID-19. 
Usually, persons who are in quarantine or isolation should not be 
brought to a vaccination setting if doing so could expose others to 
COVID-19. For those who have moderate or severe COVID-19, 
vaccination should usually be deferred until they have recovered

volunteers). ACIP guidance for vaccination of health care
personnel has been published previously (40).
•	 Household contacts (including children aged ≥6 months)
and caregivers of children aged ≤59 months (<5 years) and
adults aged ≥50 years, particularly contacts of children
aged <6 months.
•	 Household contacts (including children aged ≥6 months)
and caregivers of persons with medical conditions that put
them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza.
Health care personnel and persons who are contacts of
persons in these groups (with the exception of contacts of
severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected
environment) may receive any influenza vaccine that is otherwise
indicated. Persons who care for severely immunocompromised
persons requiring a protected environment should not receive
LAIV4. ACIP and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices
Advisory Committee (HICPAC) have previously recommended
that health care personnel who receive LAIV should avoid
providing care for severely immunocompromised persons
requiring a protected environment for 7 days after vaccination
and that hospital visitors who have received LAIV should avoid

Care should be taken to administer an age-appropriate vaccine at 
the appropriate volume for each dose. For IIV4s, the recommended 
volume may be administered from a prefilled syringe containing the 
appropriate volume (as supplied by the manufacturer), a single-dose 
vial, or a multidose vial. Single-dose vials should be used for only 
1 dose, and multidose vials should be used only for the maximum 
number of doses specified in the package insert. Any vaccine 
remaining in a vial after the maximum number of doses has been 
removed should be discarded, regardless of the volume of the doses 
obtained or any remaining volume in the vial.
Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years: 
Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses 
Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of 
influenza vaccine administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart 
during their first season of vaccination for optimal protection 
(45–48). Determination of the number of doses needed is 
based on 1) the child’s age at the time of the first dose of

for miscarriage in the 28 days after receipt of IIV, when an
H1N1pdm09-containing vaccine also had been received the
previous season (62). However, in a larger VSD follow-up study,
IIV was not associated with an increased risk for miscarriage
during the 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15 seasons, regardless
of previous season vaccination (63).
Substantially less experience exists with more recently licensed
IIVs (e.g., quadrivalent and cell culture–based vaccines) during
pregnancy than with previously available products. For RIV
(available as RIV3 from 2013–14 through 2017–18 and as
RIV4 since 2017–18), data are limited to reports of pregnancies
occurring incidentally during clinical trials, Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) reports, and pregnancy registries.
Pregnancy registries and surveillance studies exist for certain
products, for which information can be found in package inserts.
Older Adults
ACIP recommends that adults aged ≥65 years preferentially
receive any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted

can be used postpartum. Influenza vaccine can be administered 
at any time during pregnancy (i.e., during any trimester), before 
and during the influenza season. Early vaccination (i.e., during 
July and August) can be considered for persons who are in 
the third trimester during these months if vaccine is available 
because this can provide protection for the infant during the 
first months of life when they are too young to be vaccinated.
Although experience with the use of IIVs during pregnancy 
is substantial, data specifically reflecting administration of 
influenza vaccines during the first trimester are limited (see 
Safety of Influenza Vaccines in the supplementary Background 
Document). Most studies have not noted an association between 
influenza vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including 
spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) (51–61). One observational

vaccination during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk
for respiratory illness and influenza among pregnant and
postpartum persons as well as infants during the first several
months of life (33–36,49). ACIP and the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that persons
who are pregnant or who might be pregnant or postpartum
during the influenza season receive influenza vaccine (50). Any
licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4
may be used. LAIV4 should not be used during pregnancy but
can be used postpartum Influenza vaccine can be administered

HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs and of each 
of these three vaccines with one another was reviewed, focusing

the findings to all or most seasons. Studies directly comparing 
HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with one another are few and do not 
support a conclusion that any one of these vaccines is consistently 
superior to the others across seasons (70–72,79–81).
Of note, for the 2020–21 season, quadrivalent formulations 
of high-dose (HD-IIV4) and adjuvanted (aIIV4) influenza 
vaccines were introduced. Trivalent formulations of 
these vaccines are no longer available. Data summarizing 
comparisons of these newer quadrivalent formulations relative 
to nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4s against laboratory-confirmed 
influenza outcomes are not yet available.

for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for
standard-dose inactivated vaccines). The adjuvanted vaccine
contains 15 µg of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted
SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59.
HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared
with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available
for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these
vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-
confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66–68) and
cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly
retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code–defined (rather
than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and
include more influenza seasons (69–79). Certain observational
studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV
in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in
prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations. The size of
this relative benefit has varied from season to season and is not
seen in all studies in all seasons, making it difficult to generalize

influenza-associated illness, hospitalization, and death compared 
with younger persons (4,16,64). Influenza vaccines are often less 
effective in this population (65). HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have 
been evaluated in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs in 
this age group. Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are 
higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA

an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-
appropriate influenza vaccine should be administered.
Older adults (aged ≥65 years) are at increased risk for severe

Randomized Studies Comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV 
with Nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs: Prevention of Influenza-
Associated Hospitalizations and Other Serious Events. No 
data are available from randomized trials evaluating prevention 
of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations 
as a primary outcome. In a secondary analysis from a two-
season randomized trial of HD-IIV3 versus nonadjuvanted 
SD-IIV3 assessing serious adverse events (SAEs) (including 
hospitalizations) associated with laboratory confirmation of 
influenza performed outside of the study (82) and a post hoc 
analysis of pneumonia- and influenza-related hospitalizations 
from a randomized study of HD-IIV3 versus nonadjuvanted 
SD-IIV4 (83), there was no difference in risk for these 
events between the two groups (certainty level: 2, moderate). 
However, additional data are available from two single-
season, cluster-randomized studies conducted among U.S. 
nursing homes (in which nursing homes were randomized to 
vaccine groups rather than individual persons) that examined 
prevention of pneumonia and influenza diagnostic–coded 
hospitalizations. One such study noted a benefit of HD-IIV3 
relative to nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 (adjusted relative risk: 
0.79; 95% CI: 0.66–0.95; certainty level: 2, moderate) (84).

Randomized Studies Comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV
with Nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs: Prevention of Influenza
Illnesses. Randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV,
and aIIV with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-
confirmed influenza illness are few in number and were
conducted over few influenza seasons. HD-IIV3 was more
effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)- or culture-confirmed influenza-like illness
(ILI) in a two-season randomized study conducted among
32,000 persons aged ≥65 years (relative efficacy: 24%;
95% CI: 10%–36%; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single-
season randomized trials of RIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV,
one a comparison of RIV3 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 that
assessed culture-confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison
of RIV4 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 that examined PCR-
confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of
RIV among those aged ≥65 years (pooled relative efficacy:
18%; 95% CI: −17% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate).
The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4
over nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed
influenza among the full study population of persons aged

a single influenza season. Data do not point to a consistent
relative benefit of one of these three influenza vaccines over
another across multiple seasons.

these studies, an overall modest relative benefit in prevention of 
diagnostic code–defined influenza-associated hospitalizations 
has been observed for HD-IIV3 (70–77) and aIIV3 (70–72) 
versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3s. Relative benefit was not found 
in every study for all evaluated seasons for either HD-IIV3 or 
aIIV3. Published observational studies of RIV are fewer than for 
HD-IIV and aIIV. A retrospective analysis of relative effectiveness 
of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 against influenza-coded hospitalizations 
among Medicare beneficiaries during the 2019–20 season noted a 
relative effectiveness of 17% (95% CI: 9%–24%; certainty level:

Persons with a History of Guillain Barré Syndrome 
After Influenza Vaccination
A history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks 
of a previous dose of any type of influenza vaccine is considered 
a precaution for influenza vaccination (Table 2). Persons 
who are not at higher risk for severe influenza complications 
(see Populations at Higher Risk for Medical Complications 
Attributable to Severe Influenza) and who are known to have 
experienced GBS within 6 weeks of a previous influenza 
vaccination typically should not be vaccinated. As an alternative

ACIP recommends that persons with compromised
immunity (including but not limited to persons with
congenital and acquired immunodeficiency states, persons
who are immunocompromised due to medications, and
persons with anatomic and functional asplenia) should receive
an age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4. ACIP recommends that
LAIV4 not be used for these groups because of the uncertain
but biologically plausible risk for disease attributable to the
live vaccine virus. Use of LAIV4 in persons with these and
other conditions is discussed in more detail (see Dosage,
Administration, Contraindications, and Precautions) (Table 2).

possible risks for certain persons who have a history of GBS 
within 6 weeks after receipt of influenza vaccine and who also

Persons with a History of Egg Allergy
Most available influenza vaccines, with the exceptions 
of RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent, licensed for those aged 
≥18 years) and ccIIV4 (Flucelvax Quadrivalent, licensed for 
hose aged ≥6 months), are prepared by propagation of virus 
n embryonated eggs and might contain trace amounts of egg 
proteins, such as ovalbumin. For persons who report a history 
of egg allergy, ACIP recommends the following:
•	 Persons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only 
urticaria (hives) after exposure to egg should receive influenza 
vaccine. Any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., 
any IIV4, RIV4, or LAIV4) that is otherwise appropriate for 
the recipient’s age and health status can be used.
•	 Persons who report having had reactions to egg involving 
symptoms other than urticaria (e.g., angioedema or 
swelling, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent 
vomiting) or who required epinephrine or another 
emergency medical intervention can similarly receive any 
licensed, recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any IIV4, 
RIV4, or LAIV4) that is otherwise appropriate for their 
age and health status. If a vaccine other than ccIIV4 or 
RIV4 is used, the selected vaccine should be administered 
in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting, including 
but not necessarily limited to hospitals, clinics, health 
departments, and physician offices. Vaccine administration 
should be supervised by a health care provider who is able 
to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions.
All vaccination providers should be familiar with their 
office emergency plan and be certified in cardiopulmonary 
esuscitation (42). No postvaccination observation period is

in such instances, vaccination should occur in an 
inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be 
supervised by a health care provider who is able to 
recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers 
also can consider consultation with an allergist to help 
determine the vaccine component responsible for the 
allergic reaction.
	ű A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) 
to any ccIIV of any valency or to any component of 
ccIIV4 is a contraindication to future receipt of ccIIV4.
•	 For RIV4:
	ű A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis)

accine component is listed as a contraindication; no labeled 
ontraindication is specified for a history of allergic reaction to

lthough rare, can occur after influenza vaccination, even 
mong persons with no previous reactions or known allergies. 
Although vaccine components can be found in package inserts, 
dentifying the causative component without further evaluation 
i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can

n RIV have been reported to VAERS, some of which have 
ccurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions

redisposition to development of allergic manifestations in 
ffected persons (92–94). Because these rare but severe allergic 
eactions can occur, ACIP recommends the following for 
ersons with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous 
ose of an influenza vaccine (Table 3):

individual egg-based IIV4 and LAIV4 is also 
contraindicated for persons who have had a severe 
allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component 
of that vaccine (excluding egg) (see Persons with a 
History of Egg Allergy).

a reasonable assumption is that that peramivir might interfere
with the mechanism of LAIV4 if administered from 5 days
before through 2 weeks after vaccination and baloxavir might
interfere if administered from 17 days before through 2 weeks
after vaccination. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt
and LAIV4 during which interference might occur could be
further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that
delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Persons
who receive these medications during these periods before or
after receipt of LAIV4 should be revaccinated with another 
appropriate influenza vaccine (e.g., IIV4 or RIV4).
Administration of Influenza Vaccines with 
Other Vaccines
IIV4s and RIV4 may be administered simultaneously or
sequentially with other inactivated vaccines or live vaccines.
Injectable vaccines that are given concomitantly should
be administered at separate anatomic sites. LAIV4 can be
administered simultaneously with other live or inactivated
vaccines. However, if two live vaccines are not given
simultaneously, at least 4 weeks should pass after administration
of one live vaccine (such as LAIV4) before another live vaccine 
is administered (42).

and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine among adults (108); and 
Tdap in pregnancy (111). Although increased prevalence of 
injection site or systemic adverse reactions has been noted with 
concurrent administration in certain studies, these symptoms 
have usually been reported to be mild or moderate.
Among children aged 6 through 23 months, coadministration 
of IIV3 and PCV13 was associated with increased risk 
for fever on the day of vaccination and the day after (i.e., 
days 0–1 postvaccination) in an observational study conducted
during the 2011–12 season (112). A randomized clinical 
trial during the 2017–18 influenza season suggested that
delaying IIV4 administration by 2 weeks in children receiving 
diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP)

postvaccination was similar between the coadministration 
group and the group that received the mRNA COVID-19 
vaccine alone; reactogenicity rates in the group receiving 
HD-IIV4 alone were lower. No SAEs were observed. Immune 
response was similar between the mRNA COVID-19 and 
coadministration groups (103).
Relatively limited data are available on the concomitant 
administration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines. 
Studies of live attenuated zoster vaccine and IIV3 (104) or 
IIV4 (105) among persons aged ≥50 years noted similar 
antibody responses whether the two vaccines were administered 
concomitantly or 4 weeks apart. In certain studies, reduced 
responses have been noted to 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (PCV13) (106,107), tetanus antigens (108), 
and pertussis antigens (108) when coadministered with IIV3 
to adults; in most instances, the clinical significance of this is 
uncertain. Simultaneous administration of IIV4 and 23-valent 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) to persons 
aged ≥65 years was associated with lower seroprotection rates 
to one influenza B antigen at 4–6 weeks postvaccination 
compared with sequential administration 2 weeks apart. 
Seroprotection was not significantly different between the 
two groups for any of the four influenza antigens at 6 months 
postvaccination (109). Reassuring safety profiles have been 
noted for simultaneous administration of IIVs with live 
attenuated zoster vaccine (104,105); PCV13 (106,107);

COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines that might be 
more likely to cause an injection site reaction (e.g., aIIV4 
or HD-IIV4) should be administered in different limbs, if 
possible. In an interim analysis of a study of concomitant 
administration of HD-IIV4 and a booster dose of an mRNA 
COVID-19 vaccine (administered in separate upper arm sites) 
compared with administration of either vaccine alone among 
296 persons aged ≥65 years, overall reactogenicity up to 7 days

has been studied, and no evidence of decreased immunogenicity or
safety concerns was noted (122). The immunogenicity and safety
of simultaneous or sequential administration of two nonaluminum
adjuvant–containing vaccines have not been evaluated, and the
ideal interval between such vaccines when given sequentially
is not known. In the study of Shingrix and IIV4 (122), most
reactogenicity symptoms resolved within 4 days. Because of
the limited data on the safety of simultaneous administration
of two or more vaccines containing nonaluminum adjuvants
and the availability of nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine options,
selection of a nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine may be considered
in situations in which influenza vaccine and another vaccine
containing a nonaluminum adjuvant are to be administered
concomitantly. However, influenza vaccination should not be
delayed if a specific vaccine is not available. As recommended for
all vaccines, vaccines with nonaluminum adjuvants should be
administered at separate anatomic sites from other vaccines that
are given concomitantly (42).

with PCV7, PCV13, or DTaP vaccines during the 2006–07
through 2010–11 seasons (114) and with PCV13 during the
2014–15 season (115). Although concerning to parents, most
febrile seizures are brief and have a good prognosis (116).
After considering the risks and benefits, no changes in the
recommendations for administration of these vaccines were
made. Surveillance of febrile seizures is ongoing through
VAERS, and the VSD annual influenza safety surveillance
includes monitoring for seizures after vaccinations. Studies of
concomitant administration of LAIV with other vaccines are
limited. Concurrent administration of LAIV3 with measles,
mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccine to children
was not associated with diminished immunogenicity of
antigens in any of the vaccines in one study (117); diminished
response to rubella was observed in another study examining
coadministration of LAIV3 and MMR (118). No safety
concerns were noted in these studies.
In recent years, several vaccines containing nonaluminum
adjuvants have been licensed for use in the United States for
the prevention of various infectious diseases. These include
AS01B (in Shingrix, recombinant zoster subunit vaccine) (119),
MF59 (in Fluad Quadrivalent [aIIV4]) (120), and cytosine
phosphoguanine oligodeoxynucleotide (in Heplisav-B, a
recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine) (121). Data are
limited regarding coadministration of these vaccines with other
adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted vaccines, including COVID-19
vaccines. Coadministration of Shingrix with nonadjuvanted IIV4

vaccines. Each IIV, whether egg-based or cell culture–based, 
has a labeled contraindication for persons with a history of 
a severe allergic reaction to any component of that vaccine 
(Table 2). Although egg is a component of all IIV4s other 
than ccIIV4, ACIP makes specific recommendations for 
the use of influenza vaccine for persons with egg allergy 
(see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). All egg-based 
IIV4s are contraindicated in persons who have had a severe

aged ≥36 months, the remaining volume needed to make a full
dose should be administered during the same vaccination visit
or, if measuring the needed remaining volume is a challenge,
administering a repeat dose at the full volume is acceptable.
If the error is discovered later (after the recipient has left the
vaccination setting), a full dose should be administered as soon
as the recipient can return. Vaccination with a formulation
approved for adult use should be counted as a single dose if
inadvertently administered to a child.
IIV4s are administered intramuscularly (IM). For adults and
older children, the deltoid muscle is the preferred site. Infants
and younger children should be vaccinated in the anterolateral
thigh. Additional specific guidance regarding site selection and
needle length for IM injection is provided in the ACIP General
Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (42).
One IIV4, Afluria Quadrivalent, is licensed for IM injection
via the PharmaJet Stratis jet injector for persons aged 18
through 64 years (43). Persons in this age group may receive
Afluria Quadrivalent via either needle and syringe or this
specific jet injection device. Children aged 6 months through
17 years and adults aged ≥65 years should receive this vaccine
by needle and syringe only. No other IIV4s are licensed for
administration by jet injector.

IIV4s. Manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC
and ACIP guidance should be consulted for information on
contraindications and precautions for individual influenza

Quadrivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4)
Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, 
Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available 
during the 2022–23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for 
persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA 
produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from 
cell-derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the 
use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).
Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM 
injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 µg 
of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 µg total).
Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of RIV4. 
RIV4 is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe 
allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any

other influenza vaccines used within specified indications.
Dosage and Administration. LAIV4 is administered 
intranasally using the supplied prefilled, single-use sprayer 
containing 0.2 mL of vaccine. Approximately 0.1 mL (i.e., half 
of the total sprayer contents) is sprayed into the first nostril while
the recipient is in the upright position. An attached dose-divider 
clip is removed from the sprayer to permit administration of the
second half of the dose into the other nostril. If the recipient 
sneezes immediately after administration, the dose should 
not be repeated. However, if nasal congestion is present that 
might impede delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal 
mucosa, deferral of administration should be considered until 
resolution of the illness, or another appropriate vaccine should 
be administered instead. Each total dose of 0.2 mL contains 
106.5–7.5 fluorescent focus units of each vaccine virus (99).
Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of LAIV4. 
Conditions considered by ACIP to be contraindications and 
precautions for the use of LAIV4 are summarized (Table 2). 
These include two labeled contraindications that appear in 
the package insert (99) and other conditions for which there

Precautions for use of LAIV4 include the following:
•	 Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever.
•	 History of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of any 
influenza vaccine.
•	 Asthma in persons aged ≥5 years.
•	 Other underlying medical condition (other than those 
listed under contraindications) that might predispose to 
complications after wild-type influenza virus infection 
(e.g., chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular [except isolated 
hypertension], renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or 
metabolic disorders [including diabetes mellitus]).
Recent Influenza Vaccine Labeling Changes
lucelvax Quadrivalent
Since the publication of the 2021–22 ACIP influenza vaccine 
commendations, a labeling change for Flucelvax Quadrivalent 
ccIIV4) has occurred. Flucelvax Quadrivalent was initially 
pproved in 2016 for persons aged ≥4 years. Approval for persons 
ged ≥18 years was based on a randomized immunogenicity 
nd safety trial that compared Flucelvax Quadrivalent with the 
reviously approved trivalent formulation of Flucelvax (ccIIV3), 
hich had previously been licensed for persons aged ≥18 years 
n the basis of data from a randomized clinical efficacy trial. 
pproval for children aged 4 through 17 years also was based on 
mmunogenicity and safety data compared with ccIIV3, with a 
ostmarketing requirement to conduct a clinical efficacy study 
128). In March 2021, FDA approved Flucelvax Quadrivalent 
or persons aged ≥2 years on the basis of a randomized clinical

•	 Persons with cochlear implants, because of the potential for 
CSF leak that might exist for a period after implantation 
(providers might consider consultation with a specialist 
concerning the risk for persistent CSF leak if an age-appropriate 
inactivated or recombinant vaccine cannot be used).

Vaccines should not be used beyond the expiration date on 
the label. In addition to the expiration date, multidose vials also 
might have a beyond-use date (BUD), which specifies the number 
of days the vaccine can be kept once first accessed. After being 
accessed for the first dose, multidose vials should not be used after 
the BUD. If no BUD is provided, then the listed expiration date 
is to be used. Multidose vials should be returned to recommended 
storage conditions between uses. Package information might also 
specify a maximum number of doses contained in multidose vials 
(regardless of remaining volume). No more than the specified 
number of doses should be removed, and any remainder should 
be discarded. Single-dose vials should not be accessed for more 
than 1 dose. Providers should contact the manufacturer for 
information on permissible temperature excursions and other 
departures from recommended storage and handling conditions 
that are not discussed in the package labeling.

Storage and Handling of 
Influenza Vaccines
In all instances, approved manufacturer packaging information 
should be consulted for authoritative guidance concerning storage 
and handling of specific influenza vaccines. Typically, influenza 
vaccines should be protected from light and stored at temperatures 
that are recommended in the package insert. Recommended 
storage temperatures are typically 36°F–46°F (2°C–8°C) and 
should be maintained at all times with adequate refrigeration

efficacy trial conducted among 4,514 children aged ≥2 to
<18 years over three influenza seasons (Southern Hemisphere
2017 and Northern Hemisphere 2017–18 and 2018–19) (129).
Subsequently, in October 2021, FDA approved Flucelvax
Quadrivalent for persons aged ≥6 months. Approval was based
on a randomized immunogenicity and safety study conducted
among 2,402 children aged 6 through 47 months (of whom 894 
were aged 6 through 23 months). Children were randomized
n a 2:1 ratio to receive either Flucelvax Quadrivalent
