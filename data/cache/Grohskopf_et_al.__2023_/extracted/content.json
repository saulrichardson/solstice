Routine annual \ninfluenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. For each recipient, \na licensed and age-appropriate vaccine should be used. With the exception of vaccination for adults aged ≥65 years, ACIP \nmakes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate \nvaccine is available. All seasonal influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2022–23 season are \nquadrivalent, containing hemagglutinin (HA) derived from one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, one influenza A(H3N2) virus, \none influenza B/Victoria lineage virus and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s)",

Most persons who become ill after influenza virus\ninfection recover without serious complications or sequelae.\nHowever, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses,\nhospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults,\nvery young children, pregnant persons, and persons of all ages\nwith certain chronic medical conditions (1–7). Influenza also is\nan important cause of missed work and school (8–10). Routine\nannual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months\nwho do not have contraindications has been recommended by\nCDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\n(ACIP) since 2010 (11).\nVaccination provides important protection from influenza\nillness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of\ninfluenza vaccination varies depending on several factors,\nsuch as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine\nadministered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages\n(for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree\nof similarity between circulating viruses and those included in\nthe vaccine (12) During each of the six influenza seasons from",
