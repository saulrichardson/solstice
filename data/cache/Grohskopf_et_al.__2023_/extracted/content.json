Primary updates to this report include the following three topics: 1) the composition of 2022 23 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 2) updates to the description of influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2022 23 season, including one influenza vaccine labeling change that occurred after the publication of the 2021 22 ACIP influenza recommendations; and 3) updates to the recommendations concerning vaccination of adults aged ≥65 years. First, the composition of 2022 23 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A (H3 N2) and influenza B/Victoria lineage components.

      "text": "Introduction Influenza viruses typically circulate annually in the United States, most commonly from the late fall through the early spring. Most persons who become ill after influenza virus infection recover without serious complications or sequelae. However, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults, very young children, pregnant persons, and persons of all ages with certain chronic medical conditions (1–7). Influenza also is an important cause of missed work and school (8–10). Routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contra indications has been recommended by CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2010 (11). Vaccination provides important protection from influenza illness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors, such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages (for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in h i (12) D ...ifl f",

Primary updates in this report include the following: 1. The composition of the 2022 23 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A (H3 N2) and influenza B/Victoria components. For the 2022 23 season, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain hemagglutinin (HA) derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1 N1) pdm 09 like virus (for egg- based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1 N1) pdm 09 like virus (for cell culture based and recombinant vaccines); an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3 N2)-like virus (for egg based vaccines) or an influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3 N2)-like virus (for cell culture based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage like virus; and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage like virus. 2. Influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2022 23 season, their age indications, and their presentations are described (Table 1). A flu ria Quad rival ent is not expected to be available in a 0.25-mL pre filled syringe presentation. When using A flu ria Quad rival ent for children aged 6 through 35 months (who require a 0.25-mL dose), the dose must be obtained from a multi dose vial. One la be ling change is described. In October 2021, FDA granted approval for the use of Flu cel vax Quad rival ent (cell culture– based quad rival ent in activated influenza vaccine [ccIIV4]) for children aged 6 months through <2 years. As of March 2021, Flu cel vax Quad rival ent had been approved for persons aged ≥2 years. Approval for children aged 6 months through <2 years was based on results of a randomized, observer blind study that compared immunogen i city and safety of Flu cel vax Quad rival ent with that of a licensed",

Relatively fewer reports include results specific to children (19 22; findings suggestive of waning have been reported in certain studies (19 21 but not others (22). Rates of decline in vaccine effectiveness also varied. A multi season (2011 12 through 2014 15 analysis from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu VE) Network found that vaccine effectiveness decreased by approximately 7% per month for influenza A (H3 N2) and influenza B and 6 11 per month for influenza A (H1 N1) pdm09 (25). Vaccine effectiveness remained greater than zero for at least 5–6 months after vaccination. In the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAI VEN during the 2015 16 through 2018 19 seasons, vaccine effectiveness against influenza associated hospitalizations declined by approximately 8%–9% per month for all adults and approximately 10 11 per month for those aged ≥65 years (32).

A third multi season analysis (2010 11 through 2014 15 conducted in Europe noted a decline in vaccine effectiveness to 0% at 111 days post vaccination against influenza A (H3 N2) viruses.

Health care personnel and persons who are contacts of persons in these groups (with the exception of contacts of severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment) may receive any influenza vaccine that is otherwise indicated. Persons who care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment should not receive LAIV4. ACIP and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) have previously recommended that health care personnel who receive LAIV should avoid providing care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment for 7 days after vaccination and that hospital visitors who have received LAIV should avoid contact with such persons for 7 days after vaccination (41). However, such persons need not be restricted from caring for or visiting less severely immunocompromised persons. Influenza Vaccination of Persons with COVID-19 Vaccination of persons who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who are in quarantine after an exposure should include multiple considerations, such as whether bringing the person into a vaccination setting could expose others to COVID-19, whether the person is acutely ill and the severity of the illness, the presence of risk factors for severe influenza illness, the likelihood of being able to vaccinate at a later date, and the desire to avoid confusing post vaccination symptoms with those of COVID-19. Usually, persons who are in quarantine or isolation should not be brought to a vaccination setting if doing so could expose others to COVID-19. For those who have moderate or severe COVID-19, vaccination should usually be deferred until they have recovered, which is consistent with ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for (4 ) h hld",

Randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs against laboratory- confirmed influenza illness are few in number and were conducted over few influenza seasons. HD-IIV3 was more effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or culture confirmed influenza like illness (ILI) in a two season randomized study conducted among 32 000 persons aged ≥65 years (relative efficacy: 24%; 95% CI: 10 36; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single- season randomized trials of RIV versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV3 that assessed culture confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV4 that examined PCR- confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged ≥65 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: −17% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate).

Certain of these IIV4 s are approved at different dose volumes for very young children than for older children and adults. Care should be taken to administer an age appropriate vaccine at the approved dose volume for each needed dose (see Children Aged 6 Through 35 Months: Influenza Vaccine Dose Volumes) (Tables 1 and 4): • Afluria Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is 0.25 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. • Fluarix Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. • Flu cel vax Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. • FluLaval Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. • Flu zone Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. If pre filled syringes are not available, the appropriate volume can be administered from a single dose or multi dose vial.
