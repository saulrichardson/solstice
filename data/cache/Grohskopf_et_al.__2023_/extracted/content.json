Routine annual \ninfluenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. For each recipient, \na licensed and age-appropriate vaccine should be used. With the exception of vaccination for adults aged ≥65 years, ACIP \nmakes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate \nvaccine is available. All seasonal influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2022–23 season are \nquadrivalent, containing hemagglutinin (HA) derived from one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, one influenza A(H3N2) virus, \none influenza B/Victoria lineage virus and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s)",
