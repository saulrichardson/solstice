For each recipient, a licensed and age appropriate vaccine should be used. With the exception of vaccination for adults aged ≥65 years, ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed, recommended, and age appropriate vaccine is available. All seasonal influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2022 23 season are quad rival ent, containing hemagglutinin (HA) derived from one influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, one influenza A (H3N2) virus, i fl B/Vi t i li i d i fl B/Y t li i I ti t d i fl i (IIV4 )",

Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose for the season and for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester if vaccine is available during those months. Updates described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP that were held on October 20, 2021; January 12, 2022; February 23, 2022; and June 22, 2022. Primary updates to this report include the following three topics: 1) the composition of 2022 23 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 2) updates to the description of influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2022 23 season, including one influenza vaccine labeling change that occurred after the publication of the 2021 22 ACIP influenza recommendations; and 3) updates to the recommendations concerning vaccination of adults aged ≥65 years. First, the composition of 2022 23 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria lineage components. U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1) pdm 09 like virus (for egg based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) pdm 09 like virus (for cell",

      "text": "Introduction Influenza viruses typically circulate annually in the United States, most commonly from the late fall through the early spring. Most persons who become ill after influenza virus infection recover without serious complications or sequelae. However, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults, very young children, pregnant persons, and persons of all ages with certain chronic medical conditions (1–7). Influenza also is an important cause of missed work and school (8–10). Routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contra indications has been recommended by CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2010 (11). Vaccination provides important protection from influenza illness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors, such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages (for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine (12) During each of the six influenza seasons from",

This effect also might vary with recipient age; in certain studies, waning was more pronounced among older adults (19 23 26 30 32 and younger children (19). Relatively fewer reports include results specific to children (19 22; findings suggestive of waning have been reported in certain studies (19 21 but not others (22). Rates of decline in vaccine effectiveness also varied. A multi season (2011 12 through 2014 15 analysis from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu VE) Network found that vaccine effectiveness decreased by approximately 7% per month for influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B and 6 11 per month for influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 (25). Vaccine effectiveness remained greater than zero for at least 5–6 months after vaccination. In the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAI VEN during the 2015 16 through 2018 19 seasons, vaccine effectiveness against influenza associated hospitalizations declined by approximately 8%–9% per month for all adults and approximately 10 11 per month for those aged ≥65 years (32). An analysis of the 2010 11 through 2013 14 seasons noted estimated effectiveness ranging from 54% to 67% during days 0–180 post vaccination; estimated vaccine effectiveness was not significant during the period between days 181 and 365 (20). A third multi season analysis (2010 11 through 2014 15 conducted in Europe noted a decline in vaccine effectiveness to 0% at 111 days post vaccination against influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Vaccine effectiveness against influenza B viruses decreased more slowly, and vaccine effectiveness against influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses remained roughly stable at 50 55 throughout the influenza season (27).

Health care personnel and persons who are contacts of persons in these groups (with the exception of contacts of severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment) may receive any influenza vaccine that is otherwise indicated. Persons who care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment should not receive LAIV4. ACIP and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) have previously recommended that health care personnel who receive LAIV should avoid providing care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment for 7 days after vaccination and that hospital visitors who have received LAIV should avoid contact with such persons for 7 days after vaccination (41). However, such persons need not be restricted from caring for or visiting less severely immunocompromised persons. Influenza Vaccination of Persons with COVID-19 Vaccination of persons who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who are in quarantine after an exposure should include multiple considerations, such as whether bringing the person into a vaccination setting could expose others to COVID-19, whether the person is acutely ill and the severity of the illness, the presence of risk factors for severe influenza illness, the likelihood of being able to vaccinate at a later date, and the desire to avoid confusing post vaccination symptoms with those of COVID-19. Usually, persons who are in quarantine or isolation should not be brought to a vaccination setting if doing so could expose others to COVID-19.

Although vaccine components can be found in package inserts, dent if ying the causative component without further evaluation i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can be difficult. Severe allergic reactions after vaccination with an RIV have been reported to VAERS, some of which have occurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions o egg or to influenza vaccines and which might represent a predisposition to development of allergic manifestations in affected persons (92 94.

In the study of Shingrix and IIV4 (122), most reactogenicity symptoms resolved within 4 days. Because of the limited data on the safety of simultaneous administration of two or more vaccines containing non aluminum adjuvants and the availability of nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine options, selection of a nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine may be considered in situations in which influenza vaccine and another vaccine containing a non aluminum adjuvant are to be administered concomitantly. However, influenza vaccination should not be delayed if a specific vaccine is not available. As recommended for all vaccines, vaccines with non aluminum adjuvants should be administered at separate anatomic sites from other vaccines that are given concomitantly (42).",

Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. • Fluarix Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. • Flu cel vax Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. • FluLaval Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. • Flu zone Quad rival ent: The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. If pre filled syringes are not available, the appropriate volume can be administered from a single dose or multi dose vial.
