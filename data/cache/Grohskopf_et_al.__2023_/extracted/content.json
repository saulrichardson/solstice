      "text": "Influenza vaccines might be available as early as July or August, but for most persons who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine \nfor the season, vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October. However, vaccination should continue after \nOctober and throughout the season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. For most adults \n(particularly adults aged ≥65 years) and for pregnant persons in the first or second trimester, vaccination during July and August \nshould be avoided unless there is concern that vaccination later in the season might not be possible. Certain children aged 6 months \nthrough 8 years need 2 doses; these children should receive the first dose as soon as possible after vaccine is available, including \nduring July and August. Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose for \nthe season and for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester if vaccine is available during those months.\nUpdates described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP that were held on October 20, 2021; \nJanuary 12, 2022; February 23, 2022; and June 22, 2022. Primary updates to this report include the following three topics: \n1) the composition of 2022–23 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 2) updates to the description of influenza vaccines expected \nto be available for the 2022–23 season, including one influenza vaccine labeling change that occurred after the publication of \nthe 2021–22 ACIP influenza recommendations; and 3) updates to the recommendations concerning vaccination of adults aged \n≥65 years. First, the composition of 2022–23 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H3N2) and influenza \nB/Victoria lineage components. U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 \n(H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell \nculture–based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza \nA/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell culture–based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 \n(Victoria lineage)-like virus; and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. Second, the approved age \nindication for the cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine, Flucelvax Quadrivalent (ccIIV4), was changed in October \n2021 from ≥2 years to ≥6 months. Third, recommendations for vaccination of adults aged ≥65 years have been modified. ACIP \nrecommends that adults aged ≥65 years preferentially receive any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: \nquadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or \nquadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for \nvaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza \nvaccine should be used.\nThis report focuses on recommendations for the use of vaccines \nfor the prevention and control of seasonal influenza during the \nCorresponding author: Lisa A.

      "text": "Influenza viruses typically circulate annually in the United \nStates, most commonly from the late fall through the early \nspring. Most persons who become ill after influenza virus \ninfection recover without serious complications or sequelae. \nHowever, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses, \nhospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults, \nvery young children, pregnant persons, and persons of all ages \nwith certain chronic medical conditions (1–7). Influenza also is \nan important cause of missed work and school (8–10). Routine \nannual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months \nwho do not have contraindications has been recommended by \nCDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \n(ACIP) since 2010 (11).\nVaccination provides important protection from influenza \nillness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of \ninfluenza vaccination varies depending on several factors, \nsuch as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine \nadministered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages \n(for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree \nof similarity between circulating viruses and those included in \nthe vaccine (12). During each of the six influenza seasons from \n2010–11 through 2015–16, influenza vaccination prevented \nan estimated 1.6–6.7 million illnesses, 790,000–3.1 million \noutpatient medical visits, 39,000–87,000 hospitalizations, and \n3,000–10,000 respiratory and circulatory deaths each season \nin the United States (13). During the severe 2017–18 season, \nnotable for an unusually long duration of widespread high \ninfluenza activity throughout the United States and higher \nrates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations compared with \nrecent seasons, vaccination prevented an estimated 7.1 million \nillnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, \nand 8,000 deaths (14), despite an overall estimated vaccine \neffectiveness of 38% (62% against influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 \nviruses, 22% against influenza A[H3N2] viruses, and 50% \nagainst influenza B viruses) (14).\nInfluenza circulated at historically low levels in the United \nStates and globally during the 2020–21 influenza season \n(15). This was coincident with widespread implementation \nof nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masking, social \ndistancing, and suspension of in-person work and school) \nintended to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus \nthat causes COVID-19).

Although delaying vaccination \nmight result in greater immunity later in the season, deferral \nalso might result in missed opportunities to vaccinate as \nwell as difficulties in vaccinating a population within a more \nconstrained period. The potential contributions of these factors \namong persons aged ≥65 years have been assessed using a \nsimulated mathematical model examining various scenarios \nof vaccination timing, timing of onset of the influenza season, \nvaccine effectiveness, and rate of waning (39). In this model, \nduring an influenza season beginning in October and peaking \nin January, delaying vaccination until October resulted in \nmore hospitalizations if >14% of persons aged ≥65 years who \nwould have been vaccinated in August or September failed to \nget vaccinated. However, these predictions varied considerably \nwith assumed timing of season onset, rate of waning immunity, \nand vaccine effectiveness.\nVaccination efforts should continue throughout the season \nbecause the duration of the influenza season varies, and \ninfluenza activity might not occur in certain communities \nuntil February, March, or later. Providers should offer influenza \nvaccine routinely, and organized vaccination campaigns should \ncontinue throughout the influenza season, including after \ninfluenza activity has begun in the community. Although \nvaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine \nadministered in December or later, even if influenza activity has \nalready begun, might be beneficial in most influenza seasons. \nProviders should offer influenza vaccination to unvaccinated \npersons who have already become ill with influenza during the \nseason because the vaccine might protect them against other \ncirculating influenza viruses",

      "text": "Pregnant and postpartum persons have been observed to be at\nhigher risk for severe illness and complications from influenza,\nparticularly during the second and third trimesters. Influenza\nvaccination during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk\nfor respiratory illness and influenza among pregnant and \npostpartum persons as well as infants during the first several\nmonths of life (33–36,49). ACIP and the American College\nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that persons\nwho are pregnant or who might be pregnant or postpartum\nduring the influenza season receive influenza vaccine (50). Any\nlicensed, recommended, and age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4\nmay be used. LAIV4 should not be used during pregnancy but\ncan be used postpartum. Influenza vaccine can be administered\nat any time during pregnancy (i.e., during any trimester), before\nand during the influenza season. Early vaccination (i.e., during\nJuly and August) can be considered for persons who are in\nthe third trimester during these months if vaccine is available\nbecause this can provide protection for the infant during the\nfirst months of life when they are too young to be vaccinated.\nAlthough experience with the use of IIVs during pregnancy\nis substantial, data specifically reflecting administration of\ninfluenza vaccines during the first trimester are limited (see\nSafety of Influenza Vaccines in the supplementary Background\nDocument). Most studies have not noted an association between\ninfluenza vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including \nspontaneous abortion (miscarriage) (51–61). One observational\nVaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) study conducted during the\n2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons noted an association between\nreceipt of IIV containing influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and risk\nfor miscarriage in the 28 days after receipt of IIV, when an\nH1N1pdm09-containing vaccine also had been received the\nprevious season (62). However, in a larger VSD follow-up study,\nIIV was not associated with an increased risk for miscarriage \nduring the 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15 seasons, regardless\nof previous season vaccination (63).\nSubstantially less experience exists with more recently licensed\nIIVs (e.g., quadrivalent and cell culture–based vaccines) during\npregnancy than with previously available products. For RIV\n(available as RIV3 from 2013–14 through 2017–18 and as\nRIV4 since 2017–18), data are limited to reports of pregnancies\noccurring incidentally during clinical trials, Vaccine Adverse Event\nReporting System (VAERS) reports, and pregnancy registries.\nPregnancy registries and surveillance studies exist for certain\nproducts, for which information can be found in package inserts.",

If administered simultaneously, \nCOVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines that might be \nmore likely to cause an injection site reaction (e.g., aIIV4 \nor HD-IIV4) should be administered in different limbs, if \npossible. In an interim analysis of a study of concomitant \nadministration of HD-IIV4 and a booster dose of an mRNA \nCOVID-19 vaccine (administered in separate upper arm sites) \ncompared with administration of either vaccine alone among \n296 persons aged ≥65 years, overall reactogenicity up to 7 days \npostvaccination was similar between the coadministration \ngroup and the group that received the mRNA COVID-19 \nvaccine alone; reactogenicity rates in the group receiving \nHD-IIV4 alone were lower. No SAEs were observed. Immune \nresponse was similar between the mRNA COVID-19 and \ncoadministration groups (103).\nRelatively limited data are available on the concomitant \nadministration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines. \nStudies of live attenuated zoster vaccine and IIV3 (104) or \nIIV4 (105) among persons aged ≥50 years noted similar \nantibody responses whether the two vaccines were administered \nconcomitantly or 4 weeks apart. In certain studies, reduced \nresponses have been noted to 13-valent pneumococcal \nconjugate vaccine (PCV13) (106,107), tetanus antigens (108), \nand pertussis antigens (108) when coadministered with IIV3 \nto adults; in most instances, the clinical significance of this is \nuncertain. Simultaneous administration of IIV4 and 23-valent \npneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) to persons \naged ≥65 years was associated with lower seroprotection rates \nto one influenza B antigen at 4–6 weeks postvaccination \ncompared with sequential administration 2 weeks apart. \nSeroprotection was not significantly different between the \ntwo groups for any of the four influenza antigens at 6 months \npostvaccination (109). Reassuring safety profiles have been \nnoted for simultaneous administration of IIVs with live \nattenuated zoster vaccine (104,105); PCV13 (106,107); \nPPSV23 (109,110); tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, \nand acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine among adults (108); and \nTdap in pregnancy (111).

Specific recommendations for appropriate refrigerators \nand temperature monitoring equipment can be found in the \nVaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit, available at https://www.\ncdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/index.html.\nVaccines should not be used beyond the expiration date on \nthe label. In addition to the expiration date, multidose vials also \nmight have a beyond-use date (BUD), which specifies the number \nof days the vaccine can be kept once first accessed. After being \naccessed for the first dose, multidose vials should not be used after \nthe BUD. If no BUD is provided, then the listed expiration date \nis to be used. Multidose vials should be returned to recommended \nstorage conditions between uses. Package information might also \nspecify a maximum number of doses contained in multidose vials \n(regardless of remaining volume). No more than the specified \nnumber of doses should be removed, and any remainder should \nbe discarded. Single-dose vials should not be accessed for more \nthan 1 dose. Providers should contact the manufacturer for \ninformation on permissible temperature excursions and other \ndepartures from recommended storage and handling conditions \nthat are not discussed in the package labeling.",

No other potential conflicts of interest were disclosed. This report includes discussion of \nthe unlabeled use of influenza vaccines in the instance of influenza vaccination of persons with a history of egg allergy. A history of severe allergic reaction \n(e.g., anaphylaxis) to the vaccine or any of its components (which include egg for certain vaccines) is a labeled contraindication to receipt of most IIV4s \nand LAIV4. However, ACIP recommends that persons with a history of allergic reaction of any severity to egg should receive any licensed, recommended \ninfluenza vaccine that is appropriate for their age and health status. Persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to egg who receive egg-based vaccines (i.e., \nvaccines other than cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine [ccIIV4] or recombinant influenza vaccine [RIV4]) should be vaccinated in an inpatient \nor outpatient medical setting (including, but not necessarily limited to, hospitals, clinics, health departments, and physician offices); vaccine administration \nin such instances should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. No postvaccination waiting \nperiod is recommended specifically for egg-allergic persons. However, ACIP recommends that vaccine providers consider observing patients seated or supine \nfor 15 minutes after administration of any vaccine (regardless of allergy history) to decrease the risk for injury should syncope occur.",
