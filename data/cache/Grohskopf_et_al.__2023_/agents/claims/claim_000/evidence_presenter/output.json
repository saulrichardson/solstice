      "explanation": "The quote appears almost verbatim on page 8: 'For the 2022 23 season, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain hemagglutinin (HA) derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1 N1) pdm 09 like virus (for egg- based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1 N1) pdm 09 like virus (for cell culture based and recombinant vaccines); an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3 N2)-like virus (for egg based vaccines) or an influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3 N2)-like virus (for cell culture based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage like virus; and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage like virus.' The wording and structure are nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote explicitly states that recombinant vaccines (which includes Flublok) use HA derived from the same strains as those selected for the season by WHO and FDA. It distinguishes between egg-based, cell culture-based, and recombinant vaccines, and lists the exact strains used for each. This directly supports the claim that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) ensures an identical antigenic match with the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains for the 2022-23 season."

      "explanation": "A very close version of the quote appears on page 19: 'All influenza vaccines licensed in the United States will contain components derived from influenza viruses antigenic ally similar to those recommended by FDA (https www fda gov ad isor committees/ad isor committee calendar/ accines advisory committees advisory committee calendar vaccines and related biological products advisory committee march 3 2022 meeting announcement) All influenza vaccines expected'. The wording and meaning are essentially identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and spacing differences.. The quote directly states that all influenza vaccines licensed in the US (which includes Flublok) must contain components derived from influenza viruses antigenically similar to those recommended by the FDA. The FDA's recommendations are based on WHO guidance, as described elsewhere in the document. This means Flublok is required to have an antigenic match to the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, directly supporting the claim."

      "quote": "For the 2022 23 season, U.S. cell culture based in activated (ccIIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from \u2022 an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1 N1) pdm 09 like virus, \u2022 an influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3 N2)-like virus, \u2022 an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)- like virus, and \u2022 an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage like virus.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 19 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and punctuation. The relevant passage is: 'For the 2022 23 season, U.S. cell culture based in activated (ccIIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from \u2022 an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1 N1) pdm 09 like virus, \u2022 an influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3 N2)-like virus, \u2022 an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)- like virus, and \u2022 an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage like virus.' This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences (spacing, punctuation, and line breaks).. The quote directly lists the specific strains included in the recombinant (RIV4, i.e., Flublok) influenza vaccine for the 2022-23 season. The document also states that these strains are those recommended by the FDA and WHO for that season. This demonstrates that Flublok (RIV4) contains hemagglutinin (HA) antigens that are identical to the WHO- and FDA-selected strains, thus ensuring an identical antigenic match as claimed. No significant inference is required; the quote is explicit and directly supports the claim."
