One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022 23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).
