All influenza vaccines expected for the 2022-23 (Table 1); all are expected to be quadrivalent (IIV4 s).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote states that all U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines, including Flublok, will contain antigens that are antigenically similar to those recommended by the FDA, which bases its recommendations on WHO guidance. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains."

      "quote": "For the 2022-23 season, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1) pdm09 like virus (for egg based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) pdm09 like virus (for cell culture based and recombinant vaccines); an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for egg based vaccines) or an influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell culture based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage like virus; and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage like virus.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote specifies the exact strains selected for the 2022-23 season and notes that recombinant vaccines (such as Flublok) use HA derived from the same WHO- and FDA-selected strains as other vaccine types, confirming the antigenic match."

      "quote": "Quad rivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes Flublok's manufacturing process, emphasizing that the HA antigens are derived from the same cell-based reference viruses as those selected by WHO and FDA, ensuring an identical antigenic match."

      "quote": "Recommendations for the composition of Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines are made by the World Health Organization (WHO), which organizes a consultation, usually in February of each year. Surveillance data are reviewed, and candidate vaccine viruses are discussed. Information about the WHO meeting on February 25, 2022, for selection of the 2022-23 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses is available at https://www.who.int/news/item/25-02-2022recommendations-announced-for-influenza-vaccinecomposition-for-the-2022-2023-northern-hemisphereinfluenza-season. Subsequently, FDA, which has regulatory authority over vaccines in the United States, convenes a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This committee considers the recommendations of WHO, reviews and discusses similar data, and makes a final decision regarding vaccine virus composition.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains the process by which the WHO and FDA select the strains for the influenza vaccine composition, which is then used for all U.S.-licensed vaccines, including Flublok, ensuring an identical antigenic match."
