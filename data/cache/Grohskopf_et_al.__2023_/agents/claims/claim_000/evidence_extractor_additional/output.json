This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u03bcg of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u03bcg total).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote specifies that Flublok (RIV4) contains hemagglutinin (HA) derived from cell-derived influenza viruses, which are selected to match the WHO- and FDA-recommended strains, and that the vaccine is manufactured without eggs, ensuring the antigenic match is not altered by egg adaptation.",
