The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'quad rival ent' instead of 'quadrivalent').. The quote explicitly states that all seasonal influenza vaccines, including recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok), contain HA antigens derived from the same four strains (one each of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata) as selected for the season. This directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it is included in the group of vaccines formulated with these specific antigens.",

One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).
