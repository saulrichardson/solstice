One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
