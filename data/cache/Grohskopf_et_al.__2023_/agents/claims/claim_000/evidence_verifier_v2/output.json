One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",

Surveillance data are reviewed, and candidate vaccine viruses are discussed. Information about the WHO meeting on February 25, 2022, for selection of the 2022-23 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses is available at https://www.who.int/news/item/25-02-2022recommendations-announced-for-influenza-vaccinecomposition-for-the-2022-2023-northern-hemisphereinfluenza-season. Subsequently, FDA, which has regulatory authority over vaccines in the United States, convenes a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This committee considers the recommendations of WHO, reviews and discusses similar data, and makes a final decision regarding vaccine virus composition.",
