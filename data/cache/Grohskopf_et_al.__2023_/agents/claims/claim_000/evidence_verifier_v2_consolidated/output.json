The quote also refers to these as 'higher dose vaccines,' which is consistent with the claim's context. The second part of the claim, about greater immunogenicity, is supported elsewhere in the document (page 14), which states that 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies,' and that these are 'higher dose vaccines.'
