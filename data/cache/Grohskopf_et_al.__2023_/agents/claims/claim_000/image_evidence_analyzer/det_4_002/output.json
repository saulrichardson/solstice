  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines for the 2022\u201323 season, including vaccine names (standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose egg-based, egg-based with MF59 adjuvant, recombinant HA vaccine, live attenuated intranasal), presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe, multidose vial), age indications, antigen content per dose (\u00b5g HA per strain), route of administration, and adjuvant information. The table provides formulations, dosages, and administrative details for various influenza vaccines, including Flublok Quadrivalent, but it does not mention antigenic matching with WHO- or FDA-selected strains and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear and legible; however, it only covers vaccine formulations and dosing, not regulatory match assurances.",
