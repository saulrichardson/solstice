  "explanation": "A table listing licensed seasonal influenza vaccines for the 2022\u201323 season, including vaccine names/manufacturers, presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe), age indications, hemagglutinin content per dose (\u00b5g/0.5 mL), route of administration, and footnotes. Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA vaccine) is listed with 45 \u00b5g HA per 0.5 mL dose for ages \u226518 years given intramuscularly. The table provides formulation and dosing details for Flublok but contains no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim.",
