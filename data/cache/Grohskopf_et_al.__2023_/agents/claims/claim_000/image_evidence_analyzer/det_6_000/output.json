  "explanation": "Excerpt of a table from a clinical guideline listing contraindications and precautions for different influenza vaccine platforms (egg-based IIV/LAIV4, cell culture\u2013based IIV/ccIIV4, and recombinant influenza vaccine RIV/RIV4), followed by definitions of abbreviations. The table details safety considerations (contraindications and precautions) for various vaccine types; it does not provide any information about antigenic matching or strain selection, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is a partial table focused on safety warnings and contains no data on antigenic match or WHO/FDA strain selection.",
