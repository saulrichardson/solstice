  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining influenza vaccine dosing recommendations for children aged 6 months through 8 years based on prior vaccination history, indicating whether one or two doses of the 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine are needed. The figure relates to vaccine dosing schedules and does not address antigenic match or Flublok\u2019s alignment with WHO- or FDA-selected strains, so it does not support the claim.
