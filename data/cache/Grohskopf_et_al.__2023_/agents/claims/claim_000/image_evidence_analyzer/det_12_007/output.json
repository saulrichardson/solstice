  "explanation": "Excerpt of a table listing various licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines (e.g., Seqirus Quadrivalent, GlaxoSmithKline Quadrivalent, Sanofi Pasteur Quadrivalent) alongside their dose volumes (0.25 mL or 0.5 mL) and antigen content per strain (7.5 \u00b5g or 15 \u00b5g). does not support the claim because the table only provides dose volumes and antigen quantities for different influenza vaccines and contains no information about Flublok or its antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains. Note: The image is a partial table view and does not mention Flublok or antigenic matching; confidence in this assessment is high based on visible content.",
