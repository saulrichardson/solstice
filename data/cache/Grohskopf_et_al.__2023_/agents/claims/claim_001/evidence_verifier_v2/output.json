The numbers and facts match the quote to verify: HD-IIV4 (60 \u00b5g), RIV4 (45 \u00b5g), and standard dose (15 \u00b5g).. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by stating that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus, which is 3 times the amount in standard-dose inactivated vaccines (15 \u00b5g). The quote also groups RIV4 and HD-IIV4 as 'higher dose vaccines,' which in the context of the document is linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose vaccines, as discussed in the surrounding text (see also page 14: 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies...').
