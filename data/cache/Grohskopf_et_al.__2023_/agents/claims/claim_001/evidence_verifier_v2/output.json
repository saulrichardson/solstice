The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (RIV4) contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines (45 \u00b5g vs 15 \u00b5g per virus). This is explicitly stated in the quote. While the quote does not itself state that this higher antigen content is 'linked to greater immunogenicity,' the document elsewhere (page 14) discusses that HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations, and that these are higher dose vaccines. Thus, the quote, in the context of the document, supports the claim as it provides the factual basis for the antigen content difference, and the document links higher antigen content to greater immunogenicity and effectiveness.",

Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations.
