The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and phrasing.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus, which is three times the amount in standard dose inactivated vaccines (15 \u00b5g). This substantiates the first part of the claim about antigen content. The same section and the following paragraphs discuss that higher antigen content has been linked to greater immunogenicity and relative benefit compared to standard-dose vaccines, supporting the second part of the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.",
