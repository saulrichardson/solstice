The quote explicitly states that standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per strain, while Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g per strain, confirming that Flublok contains 3 times the HA antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines. This directly supports the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not directly state that this higher antigen content 'has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.' While the document elsewhere discusses immunogenicity, this specific quote only supports the antigen content comparison. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim and provides the factual basis for the second part, but does not itself make the immunogenicity link explicit.",
