      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 21 of the document under the section 'Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4)'. The text states: 'One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).

This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by stating that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus, which is three times the 15 \u00b5g per virus found in standard-dose flu vaccines (as shown elsewhere in the document, e.g., Table 1 and related text). The document also states on page 9: 'Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose in activated vaccines).' Furthermore, the document discusses that higher antigen content (as in RIV4) has been linked to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines, especially in the context of older adults (see page 14: 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies...'). Therefore, the quote, in conjunction with the surrounding document content, genuinely supports the claim.",
