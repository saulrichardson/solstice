      "explanation": "A very close version of the quote appears on page 21: 'A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).' This is an exact match to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (spacing, line breaks).. The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) per virus in a 0.5-mL dose. Standard-dose flu vaccines, as shown elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 19: 'Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose'), contain 15 \u00b5g per virus. Therefore, Flublok contains 3 times the HA antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim. The document also discusses that higher antigen content (as in RIV4 and HD-IIV4) has been linked to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines (see page 14: 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies...'). Thus, the quote, in context, supports the claim.",
