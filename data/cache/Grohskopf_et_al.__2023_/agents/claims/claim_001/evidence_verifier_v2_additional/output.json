One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).

This matches the factual content of the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus per 0.5 mL dose. Elsewhere in the document (e.g., Table 1, page 5), standard-dose flu vaccines are shown to contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus per dose. This confirms that Flublok contains 3 times the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines. The document also discusses that higher antigen content (as in RIV4 and HD-IIV4) is associated with greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines (see page 14: 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies...'). Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.",
