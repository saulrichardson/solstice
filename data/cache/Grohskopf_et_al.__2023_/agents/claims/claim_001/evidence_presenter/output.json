      "quote": "Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 9 of the document: 'Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines).' The numbers and facts match the quote to verify: HD-IIV4 (60 \u00b5g), RIV4 (45 \u00b5g), and standard dose (15 \u00b5g).. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by stating that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus, which is 3 times the amount in standard-dose inactivated vaccines (15 \u00b5g). The quote also groups RIV4 and HD-IIV4 as 'higher dose vaccines,' which in the context of the document is linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose vaccines, as discussed in the surrounding text (see also page 14: 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies...'). Thus, the quote and its context substantiate both the antigen content and the link to greater immunogenicity."

This matches the quote to be verified in all substantive facts and numbers.. The quote directly supports the claim. It confirms that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus, which is 3 times the 15 \u00b5g in standard-dose inactivated vaccines. It also states that RIV (Flublok) has shown 'relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies,' which is consistent with the claim that the higher HA content has been linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. The quote is explicit and does not require inference."

      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 21 of the document under the section 'Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine.'

This matches the quote to be verified, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by stating that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus per 0.5 mL dose, which is three times the 15 \u00b5g per virus found in standard-dose flu vaccines (as shown elsewhere in the document, e.g., Table 1 and related text). However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the assertion about HA content but does not, by itself, substantiate the link to greater immunogenicity."

The content, numbers, and technical details match the quote provided.. The quote explicitly states that standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per strain, while Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g per strain, confirming that Flublok contains 3 times the HA antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines. This directly supports the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not directly state that this higher antigen content 'has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.' While the document elsewhere discusses immunogenicity, this specific quote only supports the antigen content comparison. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim and provides the factual basis for the second part, but does not itself make the immunogenicity link explicit."
