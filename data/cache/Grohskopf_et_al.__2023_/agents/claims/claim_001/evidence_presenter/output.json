      "quote": "Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose in activated vaccines).",
      "explanation": "The quote (with minor wording differences) appears on page 9: 'Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose in activated vaccines).' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and phrasing.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus, which is three times the amount in standard dose inactivated vaccines (15 \u00b5g). This substantiates the first part of the claim about antigen content. The same section and the following paragraphs discuss that higher antigen content has been linked to greater immunogenicity and relative benefit compared to standard-dose vaccines, supporting the second part of the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim."

One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022 23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
      "explanation": "The quote (with minor wording and formatting differences) appears on page 21: 'Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022 23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years.

The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose. This is three times the amount found in standard-dose flu vaccines, which contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus (as confirmed elsewhere in the document, e.g., page 19: 'Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose'). The claim that this higher antigen content has been linked to greater immunogenicity is also supported elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 14: 'HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose in activated vaccines)... have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies'). Thus, the quote provides specific factual support for the first part of the claim (3x HA content), and the document as a whole supports the link to greater immunogenicity."

      "explanation": "The quote 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3.' appears on page 14 of the document, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, punctuation). The wording is essentially identical to the quote provided.. The quote directly states that RIV (which includes Flublok) has shown relative benefit compared with standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIVs) in certain studies. This supports the claim that Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine with 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines) is linked to greater immunogenicity or effectiveness versus standard-dose flu vaccines. The document also confirms elsewhere that RIV4 contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain (3x the standard 15 \u00b5g), so the quote, in context, supports the claim."

      "quote": "A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
      "explanation": "A very close version of the quote appears on page 21: 'A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).' This is an exact match to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (spacing, line breaks).. The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) per virus in a 0.5-mL dose. Standard-dose flu vaccines, as shown elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 19: 'Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose'), contain 15 \u00b5g per virus. Therefore, Flublok contains 3 times the HA antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim. The document also discusses that higher antigen content (as in RIV4 and HD-IIV4) has been linked to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines (see page 14: 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies...'). Thus, the quote, in context, supports the claim."

      "explanation": "The quote (or a very close version) appears on page 19: 'Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose (7.5 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.25-mL dose).' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote provides the HA content for standard-dose flu vaccines (15 \u00b5g per virus per 0.5 mL dose). The claim is that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen of standard-dose flu vaccines. Elsewhere in the document (page 21), it is stated that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus per 0.5 mL dose, which is 3 times the amount in standard-dose IIV4. Thus, this quote directly supports the first part of the claim by establishing the standard-dose baseline for comparison. The document also discusses that higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity, supporting the second part of the claim."
