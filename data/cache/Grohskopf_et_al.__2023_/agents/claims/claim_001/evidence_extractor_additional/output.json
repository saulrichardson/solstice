      "quote": "Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",

The adjuvanted vaccine contains 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59.

Two single season randomized trials of RIV versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV3 that assessed culture confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV4 that examined PCR-confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged \u226565 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: \u221217% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate). The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over non adjuvant ed SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged \u226550 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10 47 as well i lfi d ILI h d 65",
