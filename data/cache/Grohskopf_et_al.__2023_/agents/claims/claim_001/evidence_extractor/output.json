      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per virus, which is three times the amount in standard dose inactivated vaccines (15 \u00b5g), supporting the claim about antigen content."

One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022 23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides data showing that RIV4 (Flublok) was more effective than standard-dose IIV4 in preventing influenza-coded hospitalizations, supporting the link between higher HA content and greater immunogenicity/effectiveness."
