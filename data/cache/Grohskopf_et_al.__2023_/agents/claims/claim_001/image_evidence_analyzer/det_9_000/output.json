  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining influenza vaccination dosing recommendations for children aged 6 months through 8 years, indicating whether they\u2019ve previously received \u22652 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine and specifying administration of 1 or 2 doses of the 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine. The image provides pediatric dosing guidance and makes no reference to Flublok or hemagglutinin antigen content; it does not support the claim. Note: Image appears to be a dosing algorithm with no relevant antigen content data.",
