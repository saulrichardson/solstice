  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Page with table of contents, introductory text about ACIP recommendations, and MMWR editorial and production staff listings. No data on vaccine antigen content or immunogenicity. The image does not support the claim because it contains only a table of contents, general recommendations, and editorial credits, with no information on Flublok antigen content or comparative immunogenicity, and thus does not support the claim.",
