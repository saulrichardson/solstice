  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza quadrivalent vaccines (e.g., Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent) with their dosage volume and hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain (all showing 0.5 mL (15 \u03bcg) or 0.25 mL (7.5 \u03bcg) for infants). The table does not include any information on Flublok or an HA content of 45 \u00b5g (3\u00d715 \u00b5g) nor does it link antigen content to immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim. Note: The snippet is clear but only shows standard-dose vaccines; Flublok data are absent.",
