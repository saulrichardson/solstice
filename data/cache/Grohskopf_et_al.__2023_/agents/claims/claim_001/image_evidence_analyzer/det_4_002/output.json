  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table listing various FDA-approved influenza vaccines by type (standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose egg-based, adjuvanted, recombinant HA vaccine Flublok, and live attenuated), showing for each the presentation, age indication, HA antigen content per vaccine virus per dose, route, and egg protein content. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA vaccine) is listed with 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL HA antigen per virus versus 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL for standard-dose vaccines. The table shows that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines but does not provide any data on immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim in full.",
