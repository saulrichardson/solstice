      "quote": "Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose in activated vaccines).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that recombinant HA vaccines (RIV) contain a higher dose of HA antigen, which is relevant to their immunogenicity and potential to induce higher levels of antibodies."

      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by stating that RIV (recombinant HA vaccine) has shown relative benefit compared to standard-dose egg-derived vaccines in some studies."

      "quote": "A retrospective analysis of relative effectiveness of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 against influenza coded hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries during the 2019 20 season noted a relative effectiveness of 17% (95% CI: 9 24; certainty level: 3, low) (72).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) was more effective than standard-dose egg-derived vaccines in a real-world setting, supporting the claim of superior immunogenicity."
