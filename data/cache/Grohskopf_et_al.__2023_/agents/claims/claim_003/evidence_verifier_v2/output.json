Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs against laboratory- confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66 68 and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code defined (rather than laboratory confirmed outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69 79.
