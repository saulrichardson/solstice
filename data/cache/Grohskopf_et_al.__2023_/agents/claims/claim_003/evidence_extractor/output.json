      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes the recombinant technology used in RIV4, which is relevant because recombinant vaccines are not dependent on egg-based propagation and can use genetic sequences from circulating viruses, potentially allowing for a broader immune response and better cross-protection in mismatch seasons."

      "quote": "Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u03bcg for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u03bcg for RIV4, compared with 15 \u03bcg for standard dose inactivated vaccines).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by noting that RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) contains a higher dose of antigen, which is associated with a broader and potentially more robust immune response, a key factor in cross-protection."

      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66\u201368) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code defined (rather than laboratory confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69\u201379). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza associated hospitalizations. The size of this relative benefit has varied from season to season and is not seen in all studies in all seasons, making it difficult to generalize the findings to all or most seasons.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that recombinant vaccines (RIV) have shown a relative benefit over standard-dose inactivated vaccines in some studies, supporting the idea that recombinant technology can lead to broader protection, which is important in mismatch seasons."

      "quote": "A retrospective analysis of relative effectiveness of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 against influenza coded hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries during the 2019-20 season noted a relative effectiveness of 17% (95% CI: 9\u201324; certainty level: 3, low) (72).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides data showing that RIV4 (recombinant vaccine) was more effective than standard-dose inactivated vaccine in preventing influenza-coded hospitalizations, which supports the claim that recombinant technology can provide broader and potentially cross-protective immune responses."

      "quote": "A retrospective cohort analysis noted relative effectiveness of RIV4 compared with HD-IIV3 (relative effectiveness: 11%; 95% CI: 3\u201318; certainty level: 3, low) and with aIIV3 (relative effectiveness: 11%; 95% CI: 3\u201317; certainty level: 3, low); these data covered only a single influenza season. Data do not point to a consistent relative benefit of one of these three influenza vaccines over another across multiple seasons.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that RIV4 (recombinant vaccine) had a measurable benefit compared to other enhanced vaccines in a given season, supporting the idea that recombinant technology can contribute to broader protection, which is relevant for cross-protection in mismatch seasons."
