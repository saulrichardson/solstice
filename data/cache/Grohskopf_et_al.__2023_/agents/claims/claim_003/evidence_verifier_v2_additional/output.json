      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs against laboratory- confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66 68 and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code defined (rather than laboratory confirmed outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69 79. Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza associated hospitalizations.",

      "original_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that recombinant (RIV) and other enhanced vaccines have shown relative benefit over standard vaccines, which supports the claim that recombinant technology can lead to broader or more effective immune responses, potentially including cross-protection."
