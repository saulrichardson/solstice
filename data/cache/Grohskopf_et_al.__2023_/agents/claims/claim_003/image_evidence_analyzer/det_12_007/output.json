  "explanation": "A table listing various quadrivalent influenza vaccine products (e.g., Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Afluria Quadrivalent), their manufacturers, and recommended dose volumes and antigen contents. The table only provides names of influenza vaccines, manufacturers, and dosing information; it does not present any data or statements about recombinant technology, breadth of immune response, or cross-protection in mismatch seasons, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The visible portion of the table is limited to product names and dosages; no immunogenicity or efficacy data are shown.",
