  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting influenza vaccine dosing recommendations for children aged 6 months through 8 years based on prior vaccination history, accompanied by adjacent paragraphs discussing influenza vaccine effectiveness, waning over time, and study variability. The figure provides dosing flowcharts and general comments on vaccine effectiveness and waning but contains no data or statements about recombinant vaccine technology or broader immune responses and cross-protection, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Portions of text are cut off and low resolution, but no mention of recombinant technology or cross-protection is visible.",
