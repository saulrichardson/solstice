  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "The image shows page 2 of a CDC MMWR report, containing a table of contents on the left, a section titled \u201cRecommendations and Reports, MMWR Policy Notes, and Immunization Schedules (Child/Adolescent, Adult)\u201d describing ACIP and harmonization of vaccine recommendations, and below that citation information and a list of editorial and production staff. There are no figures, data, or discussion of recombinant technology or immune responses. The image does not support the claim because it contains only administrative text, table of contents, and credits, with no data or discussion on recombinant vaccine technology or cross-protective immune responses, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The page contains only administrative and citation information; no relevant clinical data are present.",
