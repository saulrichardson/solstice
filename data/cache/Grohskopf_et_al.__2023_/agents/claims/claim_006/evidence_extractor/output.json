This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that Flublok contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, which supports the claim that it is produced using a novel platform involving recombinant HA expression in insect cells."
