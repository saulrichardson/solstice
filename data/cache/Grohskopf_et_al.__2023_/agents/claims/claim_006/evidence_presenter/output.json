      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022 23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 21 of the document: 'One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022 23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' instead of 'Quadrivalent', and some spacing). The core content is unchanged.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that Flublok (RIV4) contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, which matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells. While the quote does not explicitly mention 'baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)', it does specify the use of insect cells and recombinant HA, which are the key elements of the claim. The reference to 'using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses' and 'manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs' further supports the novel, non-egg, recombinant production method. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim."

The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, which confirms the use of insect cells. While it does not mention 'baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)' by name, the description of recombinant HA production in insect cells is a hallmark of the BEVS platform. The reference to 'using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses' further supports the recombinant nature of the process. Therefore, the quote substantiates the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform involving recombinant HA expression in insect cells."
