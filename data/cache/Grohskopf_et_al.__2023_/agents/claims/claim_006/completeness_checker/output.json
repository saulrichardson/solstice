RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' instead of 'Quadrivalent', and some spacing). The core content is unchanged.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that Flublok (RIV4) contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, which matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells. While the quote does not explicitly mention 'baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)', it does specify the use of insect cells and recombinant HA, which are the key elements of the claim. The reference to 'using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses' and 'manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs' further supports the novel, non-egg, recombinant production method. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.",
