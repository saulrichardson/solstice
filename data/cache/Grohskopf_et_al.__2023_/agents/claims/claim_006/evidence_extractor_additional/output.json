This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that Flublok contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, which is a key feature of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) platform, and that it is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs, supporting the claim of a novel production platform.",
