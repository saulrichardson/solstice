The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and formatting.. The quote directly states that high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV) have shown relative benefit compared with standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIVs) in certain studies. Since RIV is a recombinant vaccine and SD-IIVs are egg-based standard-dose vaccines, this supports the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. The phrase 'relative benefit' in this context refers to improved immunogenicity or effectiveness, which aligns with the claim of a more robust antibody response.",

This fact substantiates the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV) may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose, egg-based vaccines, as higher antigen content is associated with a more robust immune response. The quote also notes that these vaccines have been evaluated in direct comparison to standard-dose vaccines, further supporting the claim.",
