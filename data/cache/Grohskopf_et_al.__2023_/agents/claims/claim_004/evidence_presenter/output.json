      "explanation": "A very close version of the quote appears on page 14: 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and formatting.. The quote directly states that high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV) have shown relative benefit compared with standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIVs) in certain studies. Since RIV is a recombinant vaccine and SD-IIVs are egg-based standard-dose vaccines, this supports the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. The phrase 'relative benefit' in this context refers to improved immunogenicity or effectiveness, which aligns with the claim of a more robust antibody response."

Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines).",
      "explanation": "A very close version of the quote appears on page 14: 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have been evaluated in comparison with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs in this age group.

The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor differences in punctuation and spacing.. The quote directly states that both HD-IIV and RIV (recombinant influenza vaccine) are higher dose vaccines, specifying that RIV4 contains 45 \u00b5g of HA antigen per virus compared to 15 \u00b5g in standard-dose, egg-based inactivated vaccines. This fact substantiates the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV) may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose, egg-based vaccines, as higher antigen content is associated with a more robust immune response. The quote also notes that these vaccines have been evaluated in direct comparison to standard-dose vaccines, further supporting the claim."

Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs against laboratory- confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66 68 and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code defined (rather than laboratory confirmed outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69 79.

      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 14 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and punctuation. The relevant passage is: 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3.

This matches the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and line breaks.. The quote directly states that RIV (recombinant influenza vaccine) and HD-IIV (high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine) have shown 'relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs [standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines]' in certain studies. While it does not use the exact phrase 'more robust antibody response,' the context of 'relative benefit' in clinical outcomes (including prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations) implies improved immunogenicity or effectiveness. The document also notes that RIV and HD-IIV are higher-dose vaccines, which supports the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines may induce a more robust response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim."

This matches the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and line breaks.. The quote describes randomized trials comparing recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV, which is higher-dose) to standard-dose egg-based vaccines (SD-IIV). It reports that, while no significant benefit was seen in those aged \u226565 years, the larger study found a relative benefit of RIV4 over SD-IIV4 in preventing PCR-confirmed influenza among all persons aged \u226550 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10\u201347). This directly supports the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response (as measured by clinical protection) than standard-dose egg-based vaccines, at least in the broader older adult population (\u226550 years)."

      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 15: 'A retrospective analysis of relative effectiveness of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 against influenza coded hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries during the 2019 20 season noted a relative effectiveness of 17% (95% CI: 9 24; certainty level: 3, low) (72).' The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor differences in punctuation and spacing.. The quote provides direct evidence that RIV4 (a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) was more effective than standard-dose egg-based IIV4 in preventing influenza-coded hospitalizations in a real-world population. This supports the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines may induce a more robust (i.e., more protective) antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines, as increased effectiveness against hospitalizations is a likely result of a more robust immune response."
