      "quote": "Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66\u201368) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code\u2013defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69\u201379). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence from studies that higher-dose recombinant vaccines (RIV) may have a relative benefit over standard-dose, egg-based vaccines, which could be due to a more robust antibody response."

      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have been evaluated in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs in this age group. Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines).",

      "quote": "In a randomized trial of RIV4 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 among persons aged \u226550 years, frequency of fever was similar between the two vaccines. Frequencies of SAEs were similar between the two groups, and none was judged to be related to a study vaccine (68). One postlicensure randomized clinical trial in the United States evaluated the comparative safety of aIIV3 compared with HD-IIV3 in 757 adults aged \u226565 years (88).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote references a randomized trial comparing RIV4 (recombinant, higher-dose) to standard-dose, egg-based vaccine, which is relevant to the claim about antibody response and supports the existence of direct comparative data."
