The quote directly states that RIV (recombinant influenza vaccine) and HD-IIV (high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine) have shown 'relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs [standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines]' in certain studies. While it does not use the exact phrase 'more robust antibody response,' the context of 'relative benefit' in clinical outcomes (including prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations) implies improved immunogenicity or effectiveness. The document also notes that RIV and HD-IIV are higher-dose vaccines, which supports the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines may induce a more robust response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines.
