      "quote": "Egg- based and cell culture based vaccines differ in the substrate in which reference vaccine viruses supplied to the manufacturer are propagated in quantities sufficient to produce the needed number of doses of vaccine. For the IIV4 s Afluria Quad rival ent (43) Fluarix Quad rival ent (123) FluLaval Quad rival ent (124) and Flu zone Quad rival ent (44), reference vaccine viruses are propagated in eggs. For Flu cel vax Quad rival ent, reference vaccine viruses are propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells instead of eggs (125).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that both egg-based and cell-based flu vaccines use biological substrates (eggs or cell cultures) to propagate vaccine viruses, which is the context in which mutations can occur during production."

      "quote": "The effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors, such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages (for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine (12).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by noting that vaccine effectiveness depends on how similar the vaccine viruses are to circulating viruses, which can be affected if mutations arise during production."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that different reference strains are used for egg-based and cell-based vaccines, which can lead to differences (potentially due to mutations) between the vaccine and circulating strains, impacting effectiveness."
