  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining influenza vaccination dosing recommendations for children aged 6 months through 8 years for the 2022\u201323 season: a decision node asks whether the child received a trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022. If yes, one dose of 2022\u201323 vaccine is indicated; if no or unknown, two doses administered at least four weeks apart are indicated. Accompanying text describes timing for dose administration. The figure provides dosing guidance and does not address vaccine production methods, the potential for mutations during production, or effects on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Figure clearly presents dosing schedule only; no information on cell- or egg-based production or mutations is included.",
