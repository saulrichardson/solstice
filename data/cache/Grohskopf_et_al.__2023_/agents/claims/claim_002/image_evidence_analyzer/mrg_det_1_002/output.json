  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A page from an MMWR Recommendations and Reports document showing a table of contents, a paragraph about ACIP recommendations, and a list of editorial and production staff. The image does not support the claim because it contains only front matter information (table of contents, recommendations overview, editorial staff) and lacks any data or statements about egg- or cell-based vaccine production mutations or their impact on effectiveness; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Limited by the image containing only introductory and staff information, with no discussion of vaccine production or mutation data.",
