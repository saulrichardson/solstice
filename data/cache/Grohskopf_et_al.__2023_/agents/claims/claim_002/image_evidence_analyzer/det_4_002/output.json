  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-column table listing licensed influenza vaccines (standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose egg-based, adjuvanted, recombinant, and live attenuated intranasal), their manufacturers, presentations (e.g., prefilled syringe, multidose vial), age indications, antigen content per dose, route of administration, and \u00b5g HA per mL. The table provides product names, formats, dosages, and administration routes for various egg- and cell-based influenza vaccines but contains no information on mutations arising during production or any effect on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Table text is legible and complete; limitation is that the table simply lists product specifications without addressing viral mutations or effectiveness.",
