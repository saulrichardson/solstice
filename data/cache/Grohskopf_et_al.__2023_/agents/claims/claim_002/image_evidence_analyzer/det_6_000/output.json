  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing contraindications and precautions for various influenza vaccine types (egg-based IIV/LAIV, cell culture\u2013based inactivated influenza vaccine [ccIIV], cell culture\u2013derived IIV, and recombinant influenza vaccine) typically in the context of egg allergy and guidance from ACIP and FDA. This table provides information on contraindications and precautions for different vaccine formulations but does not mention mutation during production or any impact on vaccine effectiveness; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Image shows a limited excerpt focusing on safety guidance; no relevant data on production mutations are visible.",
