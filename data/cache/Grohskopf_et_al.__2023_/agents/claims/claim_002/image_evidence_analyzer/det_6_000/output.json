  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing contraindications and precautions for egg-based inactivated or live attenuated influenza vaccines, cell culture\u2013based inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV), and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV). It indicates which vaccine types are contraindicated or require precaution in individuals with specific allergic histories. Abbreviations and footnotes on ACIP, FDA, and vaccine valencies appear below the table. The table only addresses contraindications and precautions related to allergies; it does not mention mutations during vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but limited to contraindication information and does not discuss production processes or antigenic changes.",
