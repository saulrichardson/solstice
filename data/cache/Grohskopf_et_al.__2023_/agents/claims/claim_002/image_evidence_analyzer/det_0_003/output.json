  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A side-by-side flowchart titled \u201cOverview of Seasonal Flu Vaccine Production\u201d comparing egg-based and cell-based processes. The egg-based pathway shows steps including propagation in embryonated chicken eggs, a note that \u201cegg adaptation may require additional passages to improve yield\u201d and a subnote \u201cpotential egg-adaptive mutations may alter antigenicity,\u201d followed by virus inactivation, purification, and formulation. The cell-based pathway shows propagation in MDCK cell culture with a note \u201cno egg adaptation required,\u201d then inactivation, purification, and formulation. Evidence: The egg-based pathway includes a note that \u201cpotential egg-adaptive mutations may alter antigenicity.\u201d The figure highlights that egg-based production can lead to egg-adaptive mutations that may alter antigenicity, but it does not indicate that cell-based production also incurs mutations or reduced effectiveness. Therefore, it does not support the claim that both cell- and egg-based vaccines have that potential. Note: Image text is small but legible; context limited to production workflows without clinical or effectiveness outcomes.",
