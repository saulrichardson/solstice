      "quote": "Egg based and cell culture based vaccines differ in the substrate in which reference vaccine viruses supplied to the manufacturer are propagated in quantities sufficient to produce the needed number of doses of vaccine. For the IIV4 s Afluria Quad rival ent (43) Fluarix Quad rival ent (123) FluLaval Quad rival ent (124) and Flu zone Quad rival ent (44), reference vaccine viruses are propagated in eggs. For Flu cel vax Quad rival ent, reference vaccine viruses are propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells instead of eggs (125).",
