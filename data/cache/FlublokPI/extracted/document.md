They are described because of the temporal relationship, the bio logic plausibility for a causal relationship to Flublok or Flublok Quad rival ent, and their potential seriousness. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.

Healthcare providers are encouraged to enroll women who receive Flublok during pregnancy in SanoﬁPasteur Inc.’s vaccination pregnancy registry by calling 1-800-822- 2463.

The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol-deﬁned ILI due to any strain of inﬂuenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), deﬁned as 1 – [Attack rate Flublok Quad rival ent Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity (″matching″) of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed.

Respiratory symptoms included sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Systemic symptoms included fever > 99°F (>37°C) oral, chills, fatigue, headache and myalgia. For subjects with an episode of ILI, a nasopha- ryngeal swab sample was collected for rtPCR testing and reﬂex viral culture of rtPCR- positive samples.

Vaccine efficacy against antigenic ally matched culture-conﬁrmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the inﬂuenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenic ally matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC- ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case deﬁnition and antigenic similarity. Table 4: Vaccine Efficacy Against Culture-Conﬁrmed Inﬂuenza in Healthy Adults 18-49 Years of Age, Study 1*
