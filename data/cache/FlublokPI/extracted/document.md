• If Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior influenza vaccine, the decision to give Flublok should be based on careful consideration of potential benefits and risks. (5.2) -----------ADVERSE REACTIONS -----------• In adults 18 through 49 years of age, the most common (≥10%) injection site adverse reaction was pain (37%); the most common (≥10%) solicited systemic adverse reactions were headache (15%), fatigue (15%) and muscle pain (11%). (6.1) • In adults 50 through 64 years of age, the most common (≥10%) injection site adverse reaction was pain (32%); the most common (≥10%) solicited systemic adverse reactions were headache (17%), fatigue (13%), and muscle pain (11%).

The mean age of Flublok study participants was 65 years; 56% were female and 80% were Caucasian. The incidence of solicited reactogenicity differed between adults 50 through 64 years of age and adults aged 65 years and older. Therefore, data from Studies 2, 3, and 4 were pooled according to age group and are presented separately (Tables 2 and 3). Most adverse reactions in both age groups were mild in severity

syringes contain no natural rubber latex. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Flublok contains recombinant Ha proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination

requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021. A single 0.5 mL dose of Flublok contains sodium chloride (4.4 mg), mono basic sodium phosphate (0.2 mg), dibasic sodium phosphate (0.5 mg), and polys or bate 20 (Tween 20 (27.5 mcg). Each 0 5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculo virus andSpodopterafrugiperdacell proteins (≤14.3 mcg), baculo virus and cellular DNA (≤10 ng), and Triton X-100 (≤100 mcg). Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single dose, pre filled syringes contain no natural rubber latex

expressed in this cell line using abaculo virus vector (Autograph a cali for nica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes. Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) i F h 2024-2025 i fl ...135 HA

It contains purified ha proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+®) that is derived rom Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frug i per da (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts.

8.5 Geriatric Use Data from an efficacy study (Study 6), which included 1759 subjects ≥65 years and 525 subjects ≥75 years who received Flublok Quad rival ent, are insufficient to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects (See Clinical Studies [14]) D f Fl bl k Q d i l l Fl bl k b b h i

Data froma randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that children 6 months to less than 3 years of age had diminished hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) responses to Flublok compared to au. S.-licensedinfluenza vaccine approved for usein this population, strongly suggesting that Flublok would not be effective in children younger than3 years of age (6). Safety and effectiveness of Flublok have not been established in children 3 years to less than 18 years of age.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along wit the mother’sclinical need for Flublok and any potential adverse effects on the breastfe child fromFlublok or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, th underlying condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine.

The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 [Attack rate Flublok Quad rival ent Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity (″matching″) of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza a (H3 N2) viruses

reaction (rtPCR) -confirmed influenza was assessed by active and passive surveillance for influenza like illness (ILI) beginning 2 weeks post vaccination until the end of the influenza season, approximately 6 months post- vaccination. ILI was defined as having at least one symptom (no specified duration) in each of two categories of respiratory and systemic symptoms. Respiratory symptoms included sore throat, cough, sputum production wheezing and difficulty breathing. Systemic symptoms included fever > 99°F (>37°C) oral chills, fatigue, headache and myalgia. For subjects with an episode of ILI, an a so pharyngeal swab sample was collected for rtPCR testing and reflex viral culture of rtpcr positive samples.
