FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION
1
INDICATIONS AND USAGE
Flublokisavaccineindicatedfor activeimmunizationfor thepreventionof diseasecaused
by inﬂuenzaAvirus subtypes and inﬂuenza type Bvirus contained in the vaccine. Flublok
is approved for use in persons 18 years of age and older.
2
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
For intramuscular use.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discol-
oration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. If either of these
conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.
Gently invert the preﬁlled syringe prior to affixing a sterile needle.

DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
lublok is an injection. A single dose is 0.5 mL.
CONTRAINDICATIONS

Do not administer Flublok to anyone with a history of severe allergic reactions (e.g.,
anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine. [see Postmarketing Experience [6.2] and
Description (11)]

g g

Appropriate medical treatment must be immediately available to manage potentia
anaphylactic reactions following administration of Flublok.
5.2 Guillain-Barré Syndrome
If GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior inﬂuenza vaccine, the decision
togiveFlublokshouldbebasedoncareful considerationof thepotential beneﬁtsandrisks
The 1976 swine inﬂuenza vaccine was associated with an increased frequency of
Guillain-BarréSyndrome(GBS). Evidenceforacausal relationof GBSwithotherinﬂuenza
vaccines is inconclusive; if an excess risk exists, it is probably slightly more than one
additional case per 1 million persons vaccinated.

If Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior
inﬂuenza vaccine, the decision to give Flublok should be based on careful
consideration of potential beneﬁts and risks. (5.2)


### ADVERSE REACTIONS

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience
Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction
rates observed in the clinical studies of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates
in the clinical studies of another vaccine and may not reﬂect the rates observed in clinical
practice.
The safety experience with Flublok Quadrivalent is relevant to Flublok because both
vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.
Flublok
Flublok has been administered to and safety data collected from2497 adults 18 through
49 years of age, 972 adults 50 through 64 years of age, and 1078 adults aged 65 years
and older enrolled in ﬁve randomized, placebo- or active-controlled clinical trials. Clinical
safety data for Flublok are presented fromfour clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4). Data
from a placebo-controlled trial in adults 18 through 49 years of age (Study 1) are
presented, followed by data pooled according to age group fromStudies 2 and 4 (adults
50 through 64 years of age) and Studies 3 and 4 (adults aged 65 years and older).


## Page 2

Reactogenicity data froma small Phase 2 trial (Study 5) in adults 18 through 49 years of
age, 153 of whom received Flublok 135mcg, are not presented. However, subjects from
Study 5 are included in the description of deaths and serious adverse events (SAEs). In
all studies local (injectionsite) andsystemic adversereactions weresolicitedwiththeuse
of a memory aid for 7 days following vaccination, and unsolicited adverse reactions were
collected for 28-30 days post-vaccination. In Studies 1- 3 and 5, SAEs were collected for
6 months post-vaccination via clinic visit or telephone follow up on Day 28, telephone
follow up on Day 180, or by spontaneous reporting. Study 4 collected SAEs through 30
days following receipt of vaccine. Study 4 also actively solicited pre-speciﬁed common
hypersensitivity-type reactions through 30 days following receipt of vaccine as a primary
endpoint.
Study 1 (NCT00539981) included 4648 subjects 18 through 49 years of age for safety
analysis, randomized to receive Flublok (n=2344) or placebo (n=2304) (1) (see Clinical
Studies [14.1]).
Study 2 (NCT00539864) included 602 subjects 50 through 64 years of age for safety
analysis, randomized to receive Flublok (n=300) or another U.S.-licensed trivalent
inﬂuenza vaccine (Fluzone, manufactured by SanoﬁPasteur, Inc.) as an active control
(n=302) (2).
Study 3 (NCT00395174) included 869 subjects aged 65 years and older for safety
analysis, randomized to receive Flublok (n=436) or another U.S.-licensed trivalent
inﬂuenza vaccine (Fluzone) as an active control (n=433) (3).
Study 4 (NCT01825200) included 2627 subjects aged 50 years and older for safety
analysis, randomized to receive Flublok (n=1314) or another U.S.-licensed trivalent
inﬂuenzavaccine(Aﬂuria, manufacturedbybioCSLPtyLtd.)asanactivecontrol (n=1313).
Among subjects 50 through 64 years of age, 672 received Flublok and 665 received
Aﬂuria. Among subjects aged 65 years and older, 642 received Flublok and 648 received
Aﬂuria.
In a clinical trial of adults 18-49 years of age (Study 1, Table 1) the mean age of
participants was 32.5 years, 59% were female, and 67% were Caucasian (see Clinical
Studies [14.1]).

Across three clinical trials (Studies 2 – 4, Tables 2 and 3) a total of 2050 adults age 50
years and older received Flublok and 2048 received a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated
inﬂuenza vaccine (IIV3) comparator. The mean age of Flublok study participants was 65
years; 56% were female and 80% were Caucasian.
The incidence of solicited reactogenicity differed between adults 50 through 64 years of
age and adults aged 65 years and older. Therefore, data from Studies 2, 3, and 4 were
pooled according to age group and are presented separately (Tables 2 and 3).
Most adverse reactions in both age groups were mild in severity.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience
The following events have been spontaneously reported during post approval use of
Flublok or Flublok Quadrivalent. They aredescribedbecauseof thetemporal relationship,
the biologic plausibility for a causal relationship to Flublok or Flublok Quadrivalent, and
their potential seriousness. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a
population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency
or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.
Immune system disorders: anaphylaxis, allergic reactions, and other forms of hypersen-
sitivity (including urticaria).

Nervous system disorders: facial palsy (Bell’s palsy), Guillain-Barré syndrome, syncope
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
1 Pregnancy

Healthcare providers are encouraged to enroll women who receive Flublok during
pregnancy in SanoﬁPasteur Inc.’s vaccination pregnancy registry by calling 1-800-822-
2463

All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S.
general population, theestimatedbackgroundrisks of major birthdefects andmiscarriage

The developmental and health beneﬁts of breastfeeding should be considered along with
the mother’s clinical need for Flublok and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed
child fromFlublok or fromthe underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the
underlying condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine.
84 Pediatric Use

Data froma randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that children 6 months to less than
3 years of age had diminished hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) responses to Flublok
comparedtoaU.S.-licensedinﬂuenzavaccineapprovedforuseinthispopulation, strongly
suggestingthat Flublok wouldnot beeffectiveinchildrenyounger than3years of age(6).
Safety and effectiveness of Flublok have not been established in children 3 years to less
than 18 years of age.
G

Data froman efficacy study (Study 6), which included 1759 subjects ≥65 years and 525
subjects ≥75 years who received Flublok Quadrivalent, are insufficient to determine
whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects (See Clinical Studies
[14]). Data for Flublok Quadrivalent are relevant to Flublok because both vaccines are
manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.

DESCRIPTION

SC
O
Flublok [Inﬂuenza Vaccine] is a sterile, clear, colorless injection containing recombinant
hemagglutinin(HA) proteinsfromthreeinﬂuenzavirusesfor intramuscular use. It contains
puriﬁedHAproteins producedinacontinuous insect cell line(expresSF+®) that is derived
from Sf9 cells of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths,
caterpillars and butterﬂies), and grown in serum-free medium composed of chemically-
deﬁned lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is
expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear
polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further puriﬁed by
column chromatography. The puriﬁed HAs are then blended and ﬁlled into single-dose
syringes

Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS)
equirements. For the2024-2025inﬂuenzaseasonit is formulatedtocontain135mcgHA
er 0.5mLdose, with45mcgHAof eachof thefollowing3inﬂuenzavirusstrains:A/West
Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/
022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021

A single 0.5 mL dose of Flublok contains sodium chloride (4.4 mg), monobasic sodium
phosphate (0.2 mg), dibasic sodiumphosphate (0.5 mg), and polysorbate 20 (Tween®20)
27.5mcg). Each0.5mLdoseof Flublokmayalsocontainresidual amountsof baculovirus
andSpodopterafrugiperdacell proteins (≤14.3mcg), baculovirus andcellular DNA(≤10
ng), and Triton X-100 (≤100 mcg).
Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single-dose, preﬁlled
syringes contain no natural rubber latex.
2
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Flublok contains recombinant HAproteins of the three strains of inﬂuenza virus speciﬁed
by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function
as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) antibody).
Antibodies against one inﬂuenza virus type or subtype confer limited or no protection
against another. Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of inﬂuenza virus might
not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent

CLINICAL STUDIES


### 14.1 Efficacy Against Laboratory-Conﬁrmed Inﬂuenza

he efficacy of Flublok in protecting against culture-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza illness was
valuated in a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial conducted
n the U.S. during the 2007-2008 inﬂuenza season in adults 18-49 years of age (Study
) (1)

) ( )
Study 1 enrolled and vaccinated 4648 healthy adults (mean age 32.5 years) randomized
n a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Flublok (n=2344) or saline placebo (n=2304).
Among enrolled subjects, 59%were female, 67%were white, 19%African-American, 2%
Asian, < 1%otherraces, and11%of Latino/Hispanicethnicity. Culture-conﬁrmedinﬂuenza
was assessed by active and passive surveillance for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) beginning
2 weeks post-vaccination until the end of the inﬂuenza season, approximately 7 months
post- vaccination. ILI was deﬁned as having at least 2 of 3 symptoms (no speciﬁed
duration) in the following categories: 1) fever ≥100°F; 2) respiratory symptoms (cough,
sore throat, or runny nose/stuffy nose); or 3) systemic symptoms (myalgias, arthralgias,
headache, chills/sweats, or tiredness/malaise). For subjects with an episode of ILI, nasa
and throat swab samples were collected for viral culture.


## Page 4

The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 1 was Centers for Disease Control-deﬁned
inﬂuenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) with a positive culture for an inﬂuenza virus strain
antigenically resembling a strain represented in Flublok. CDC-ILI is deﬁned as fever of
≥100°F oral accompanied by cough, sore throat, or both on the same day or on
consecutive days. Attack rates and vaccine efficacy (VE), deﬁned as the reduction in the

(n=4648)

(
)
The pre-deﬁned success criterion for the primary efficacy analysis was that the lowe
bound of the 95%conﬁdence interval (CI) of VEshould be at least 40%. Vaccine efficacy
against antigenically matched culture-conﬁrmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably
because 96% of the inﬂuenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were no
antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis
of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any
subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC- ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy
estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case
deﬁnition and antigenic similarity

#Secondary endpoint of trial.
ÞExploratory (prespeciﬁed) endpoint of trial

The efficacy of Flublok Quadrivalent is relevant to Flublok because both vaccines are
manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions (see Descrip-
tion [11])

Study 6 evaluated the efficacy of Flublok Quadrivalent in a randomized, observer-blind,
ctive-controlled, multi-center trial conducted during the 2014-2015 inﬂuenza season in
dults 50 years of age and older. Atotal of 8963 healthy, medically stable adults (mean
ge 62.5 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Flublok
Quadrivalent (n=4474) or a U.S.-licensed quadrivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccine

ymptoms. Respiratory symptoms included sore throat, cough, sputum production,
wheezinganddifficultybreathing. Systemicsymptomsincludedfever > 99°F(>37°C) oral,
hills, fatigue, headache and myalgia. For subjects with an episode of ILI, a nasopha-
yngeal swab sample was collected for rtPCR testing and reﬂex viral culture of rtPCR-
ositive samples.

The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol-deﬁned ILI due to
any strain of inﬂuenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), deﬁned as 1 –
Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent/ Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total
efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative
efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity
″matching″) of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemio-
ogical data for the 2014-2015 inﬂuenza season indicated that InﬂuenzaA(H3N2) viruses

predominated and that most inﬂuenzaA/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar whil
A/H1N1 and B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens.
