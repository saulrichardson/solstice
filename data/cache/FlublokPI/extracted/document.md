The incidence of solicited reactogenicity differed between adults 50 through 64 years of

6.2 Postmarketing Experience
The following events have been spontaneously reported during post approval use of
Flublok or Flublok Quadrivalent. They aredescribedbecauseof thetemporal relationship,
the biologic plausibility for a causal relationship to Flublok or Flublok Quadrivalent, and
their potential seriousness. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a
population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency
or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.
Immune system disorders: anaphylaxis, allergic reactions, and other forms of hypersen-
sitivity (including urticaria).
Nervous system disorders: facial palsy (Bell’s palsy), Guillain-Barré syndrome, syncope.

8.5 Geriatric Use
Data froman efficacy study (Study 6), which included 1759 subjects ≥65 years and 525
subjects ≥75 years who received Flublok Quadrivalent, are insufficient to determine
whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects (See Clinical Studies

Data froma randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that children 6 months to less than
years of age had diminished hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) responses to Flublok

uggestingthat Flublok wouldnot beeffectiveinchildrenyounger than3years of age(6).
Safety and effectiveness of Flublok have not been established in children 3 years to less

The developmental and health beneﬁts of breastfeeding should be considered along wit
the mother’s clinical need for Flublok and any potential adverse effects on the breastfe

The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol-deﬁned ILI due to
any strain of inﬂuenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), deﬁned as 1 –
[Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent/ Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total
efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative
efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity
(″matching″) of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemio-

The pre-deﬁned success criterion for the primary efficacy analysis was that the lowe
bound of the 95%conﬁdence interval (CI) of VEshould be at least 40%. Vaccine efficacy
against antigenically matched culture-conﬁrmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably
because 96% of the inﬂuenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not
antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis
of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any
ubject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC- ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy
estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case
deﬁnition and antigenic similarity.

*Study 6 is registered as NCT02285998.
†Efficacy Population included all randomized subjects who received study vaccine and
providedanyfollow-updocumentationfor inﬂuenza-likeillnessbeginningat least 14days
post-vaccination. Excluded subjects with protocol deviations that could adversely affect
efficacy.
‡Primary Analysis. All cases of rtPCR-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza are included. Antigenic char-
acterizationandgeneticsequencingtodeterminesimilarityof isolatestovaccineantigens
were not performed. CDC surveillance data indicated that the majority of inﬂuenza
A/H3N2 wild type viruses were antigenically distinct whereas inﬂuenzaA/H1N1 and type
B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season.
Study 6 met the pre-speciﬁed success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of
the 2-sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent relative to Comparator
should be not less than - 20%)
