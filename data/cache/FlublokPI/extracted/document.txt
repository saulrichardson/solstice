The 1976 swine influenza vaccine was associated with an increased frequency Guill a in Barr Syndrome (GBS). Evidence for a causal relation of GBSwithotherinfluen vaccines is inconclusive; if an excess risk exists, it is probably slightly more than oadditional case per 1 million persons vaccinated

Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the viro logic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year’sinfluenza vaccine. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) antibody)

requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021. A single 0.5 mL dose of Flublok contains sodium chloride (4.4 mg), mono basic sodium phosphate (0.2 mg), dibasic sodium phosphate (0.5 mg), and polys or bate 20 (Tween 20 (27.5 mcg). Each 0 5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculo virus andSpodopterafrugiperdacell proteins (≤14.3 mcg), baculo virus and cellular DNA (≤10 ng), and Triton X-100 (≤100 mcg).

8.5 Geriatric Use Data from an efficacy study (Study 6), which included 1759 subjects ≥65 years and 525 subjects ≥75 years who received Flublok Quad rival ent, are insufficient to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects (See Clinical Studies

Data froma randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that children 6 months to less than 3 years of age had diminished hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) responses to Flublok compared to au. S.-licensedinfluenza vaccine approved for usein this population, strongly suggesting that Flublok would not be effective in children younger than3 years of age (6). Safety and effectiveness of Flublok have not been established in children 3 years to less tthan 18 years of age

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’sclinical need for Flublok and any potential adverse effects on the breast fed child fromFlublok or from the underlying maternal condition.

Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 – [Attack rate Flublok Quad rival ent Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5).

Respiratory symptoms included sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Systemic symptoms included fever > 99°F (>37°C) oral, chills, fatigue, headache and myalgia. For subjects with an episode of ILI, an a soph a- rynge al swab sample was collected for rtPCR testing and reflex viral culture of rtPCR- positive samples.

The pre defined success criterion for the primary efficacy analysis was that the lower bound of the 95 confidence interval (CI) of Ve should be at least 40%. Vaccine efficacy against antigenic ally matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenic ally matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC- ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity. Table 4: Vaccine Efficacy Against Culture-Confirmed Influenza in Healthy Adults 18-49 Years of Age, Study 1*

CDC-ILI is defined as fever of ≥100°F oral accompanied by cough, sore throat, or both on the same day or on consecutive days.
