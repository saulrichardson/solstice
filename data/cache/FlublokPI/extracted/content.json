      "text": "development or female fertility were observed in the study. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether Flublok is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects of Flublok on the breast fed infant or on milk production excretion. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’sclinical need for Flublok and any potential adverse effects on the breast fed child from Flublok or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. 8.4 Ped i at ric Use Data from a randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that children 6 months to less than 3 years of age had diminished hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) responses to Flublok compared to a U.S.-licensed influenza vaccine approved for use in this population, strongly suggesting that Flublok would not be effective in children younger than 3 years of age (6). Safety and effectiveness of Flublok have not been established in children 3 years to less tthan 18 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Data from an efficacy study (Study 6), which included 1759 subjects ≥65 years and 525 subjects ≥75 years who received Flublok Quad rival ent, are insufficient to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects (See Clinical Studies [14]). Data for Flublok Quad rival ent are relevant to Flublok because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions. 11 DESCRIPTION Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile, clear, color less injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+®) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frug i per da (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using aba culo virus vector (Autograph a cali for nica nuclear poly he dros is virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes. Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021. A single 0.5 mL dose of Flublok contains sodium chloride (4.4 mg), mono basic sodium phosphate (0.2 mg), dibasic sodium phosphate (0.5 mg), and polys or bate 20 (Tween 20 (27.5 mcg). Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculo virus and Spodoptera frug i per da cell proteins (≤14.3 mcg), baculo virus and cellular DNA (≤10 ng), and Triton X-100 (≤100 mcg). Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single dose, pre filled syringes contain no natural rubber latex. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) antibody). Antibodies against one influenza virus type or subtype confer limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against anew antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the viro logic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year’sinfluenza vaccine. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Flublok has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of male fertility in animals. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Efficacy Against Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza The efficacy of Flublok in protecting against culture confirmed influenza illness was evaluated in a randomized, observer blind, placebo controlled multi center trial conducted in the U.S. during the 2007-2008 influenza season in adults 18-49 years of age (Study 1). (1) Study 1 enrolled and vaccinated 4648 healthy adults (mean age 32.5 years) randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Flublok (n=2344) or saline placebo (n=2304). Among enrolled subjects, 59% were female, 67% were white, 19% African-American, 2% Asian, < 1% other races, and 11% of Latino/Hispanic ethnicity. Culture confirmed influenza was assessed by active and passive surveillance for influenza like illness (ILI) beginning 2 weeks post vaccination until the end of the influenza season, approximately 7 months post- vaccination. ILI was defined as having at least 2 of 3 symptoms (no specified duration) in the following categories: 1) fever ≥100°F; 2) respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, or runny nose stuffy nose); or 3) systemic symptoms (myalgias, arthralgias, headache chills sweats or tiredness malaise For subjects with an episode of ILI nasal",

They are described because of the temporal relationship, the bio logic plausibility for a causal relationship to Flublok or Flublok Quad rival ent, and their potential seriousness. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.

Excluded subjects with protocol deviations that could adversely affect efficacy. ‡Primary Analysis. All cases of rtPCR-confirmed influenza are included. Antigenic characterization and genetic sequencing to determine similarity of isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC surveillance data indicated that the majority of influenza A/H3 N2 wild type viruses were antigenic ally distinct whereas influenza A/H1 N1 and type B viruses were antigenic ally similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quad rival ent relative to Comparator should be not less than 20%)",
