<div class="text">he efficacy of Flublok in protecting against culture-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza illness was<br>valuated in a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial conducted<br>n the U.S. during the 2007-2008 inﬂuenza season in adults 18-49 years of age (Study<br>) (1)</div>
<div class="text">) ( )<br>Study 1 enrolled and vaccinated 4648 healthy adults (mean age 32.5 years) randomized<br>n a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Flublok (n=2344) or saline placebo (n=2304).<br>Among enrolled subjects, 59%were female, 67%were white, 19%African-American, 2%<br>Asian, < 1%otherraces, and11%of Latino/Hispanicethnicity. Culture-conﬁrmedinﬂuenza<br>was assessed by active and passive surveillance for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) beginning<br>2 weeks post-vaccination until the end of the inﬂuenza season, approximately 7 months<br>post- vaccination. ILI was deﬁned as having at least 2 of 3 symptoms (no speciﬁed<br>duration) in the following categories: 1) fever ≥100°F; 2) respiratory symptoms (cough,<br>sore throat, or runny nose/stuffy nose); or 3) systemic symptoms (myalgias, arthralgias,<br>headache, chills/sweats, or tiredness/malaise). For subjects with an episode of ILI, nasa<br>and throat swab samples were collected for viral culture.</div>

Vaccine efficacy<br>against antigenically matched culture-conﬁrmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably<br>because 96% of the inﬂuenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were no<br>antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis<br>of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any<br>subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC- ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy<br>estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0).
