<div class="text">n 4648). The pre defined success criterion for the primary efficacy analysis was that the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of VE should be at least 40%. Vaccine efficacy against antigenic ally matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenic ally matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC- ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0).

<div class="text">The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 1 was Centers for Disease Control defined nfluenza-like illness (CDC ILI with a positive culture for an influenza virus strain antigenic ally resembling a strains represented in Flublok. CDC-ILI is defined as fever of ≥100°F oral accompanied by cough, sore throat, or both on the same day or on consecutive days. Attack rates and vaccine efficacy (VE), defined as the reduction in the nfluenza rate for Flublok relative to placebo, were calculated for the total vaccinated cohort (n=4648).</div>
