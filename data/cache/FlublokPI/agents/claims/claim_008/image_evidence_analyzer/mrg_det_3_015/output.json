  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing rates of grade 3 solicited local and systemic adverse events in adults aged 50\u201364 and \u226565 years, showing percentages for Flublok Quadrivalent and a comparator standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4c) with sample sizes. The table presents adverse event rates for Flublok versus a standard-dose vaccine and does not provide any information on hemagglutinin (HA) content per strain, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is poor and the text is largely illegible, limiting the ability to extract detailed information.",
