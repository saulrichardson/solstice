  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A clinical trial table listing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (%) by severity (any, moderate, severe) for two studies, including footnotes referencing U.S.-licensed IIV3 comparators. The table presents adverse event rates and does not include any information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear but contains only safety outcome data; no dosage or HA content details are provided.",
