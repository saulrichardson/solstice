The wording and numbers match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain (for three strains, totaling 135 mcg per 0.5 mL dose). This supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, which is three times the 15 mcg per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine. The quote provides the specific numbers needed to substantiate the claim.",
