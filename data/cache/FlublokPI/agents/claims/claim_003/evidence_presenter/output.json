An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 4 of the document, in the section describing Study 1. The text states: 'Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides explicit evidence that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) demonstrated efficacy (44.8%) against influenza strains even when the circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine. This is direct evidence of cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim. The document does not explicitly state the mechanism (broader immune response), but it does show that recombinant technology (Flublok) provided protection in a mismatch context."

      "quote": "The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity (\"matching\") of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre-specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent relative to Comparator matched strains \u226510%).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 4 of the document, with only minor formatting and wording differences. The content is semantically equivalent: 'The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza.

All facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved.. The quote directly states that Study 6 (using Flublok Quadrivalent) met its efficacy endpoint during the 2014-2015 influenza season, when the predominant circulating H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar (i.e., a mismatch season). This demonstrates that the vaccine provided protection even when the circulating strain did not match the vaccine strain, which is evidence of cross-protection. While the quote does not explicitly attribute this to a 'broader immune response' from recombinant technology, it does provide specific data showing efficacy in a mismatch season, which supports the claim that recombinant technology may provide cross-protection."

The quote directly states that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) showed a 44.8% efficacy against all influenza strains, regardless of antigenic match, in subjects with influenza-like illness. This provides explicit evidence that the vaccine was effective even when the circulating strains did not match the vaccine strains, supporting the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection in a mismatch season."

      "explanation": "A multi-row table presenting vaccine efficacy results from a clinical trial of Flublok (a recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine). Rows show endpoints for CDC-defined influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) and culture-confirmed cases: first restricted to strains matched to the vaccine, then to any strain regardless of match, and finally to all influenza-like illness cases. For each endpoint, the number of cases and attack rates per 100 subjects are listed for vaccine and comparator groups, followed by calculated vaccine efficacy percentages and 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses by influenza A and B are also included. Evidence: For culture-confirmed cases with any strain regardless of match to the vaccine, the table reports a vaccine efficacy of 44.6% (95% CI: 18.8\u201362.6), and for all CDC-ILI cases regardless of match, efficacy of 44.8% (95% CI: 24.4\u201360.0). The observed efficacy of the recombinant vaccine against strains not matched to the vaccine demonstrates clinical cross-protection, and thus supports the claim that recombinant technology may provide broader immune protection even in a mismatch season. Note: The table shows clinical efficacy rather than direct immunogenicity data, and does not explicitly name the season as a mismatch season or compare to non-recombinant vaccines, so interpretation relies on the assumption that non-matched strains represent antigenic mismatch."
