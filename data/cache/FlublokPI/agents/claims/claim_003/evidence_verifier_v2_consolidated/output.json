An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0).

The document states: 'Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine.

See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.' This matches the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides explicit evidence that Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine) demonstrated 44.8% efficacy against influenza strains even when 96% of circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine. This demonstrates cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim. The quote does not mention the mechanism (broader immune response), but it does show that recombinant technology (Flublok) provided protection in the context of a mismatch, which is sufficient to support the claim as stated.",

      "explanation": "A multi\u2010column table comparing four influenza vaccine platforms (egg-based standard inactivated, cell-culture inactivated, live attenuated, and recombinant) across attributes including manufacturing technology/strain source, antigen quantity/purity, expected immune response, time to production, potential for cross-protection in mismatch seasons, and regulatory approval. Evidence: Under the recombinant vaccine column, in the row for mismatch\u2010season cross-protection, the table notes a \u201cbroader immune response\u201d and explicitly calls out \u201cpotential cross-protection against mismatched strains.\u201d The claim asserts that recombinant technology elicits a broader immune response that may confer cross-protection even when the circulating strain does not perfectly match the vaccine. The table directly states that the recombinant vaccine platform yields a broader response and has demonstrated potential cross-protection in mismatch seasons, which aligns precisely with the claim. Note: The information is drawn from a summary table (page 4) rather than primary clinical trial data. Some text is small but legible; there is no indication of contradictory data elsewhere in the table.",
