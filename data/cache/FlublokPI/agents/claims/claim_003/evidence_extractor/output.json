      "quote": "Vaccine efficacy against antigenic ally matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenic ally matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC- ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) demonstrated efficacy against influenza strains even when there was a mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains, supporting the claim of broader immune response and potential cross-protection."

      "quote": "CDC surveillance data indicated that the majority of influenza A/H3 N2 wild type viruses were antigenic ally distinct whereas influenzaA/H1 N1 and type B viruses were antigenic ally similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quad rival ent relative to Comparator should be not less than 20%)",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that even in a season where the predominant circulating strain (A/H3N2) was antigenically distinct (i.e., a mismatch), Flublok quadrivalent still met efficacy criteria, supporting the claim of cross-protection in mismatch seasons."
