      "quote": "CDC surveillance data indicated that the majority of influenza A/H3 N2 wild type viruses were antigenic ally distinct whereas influenzaA/H1 N1 and type B viruses were antigenic ally similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quad rival ent relative to Comparator should be not less than 20%)",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that even when the circulating H3N2 viruses were antigenically distinct (i.e., a mismatch), Flublok quadrivalent still met efficacy criteria, supporting the idea of broader immune response and cross-protection."
