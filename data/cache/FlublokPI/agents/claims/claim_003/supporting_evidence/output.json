An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC- ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) demonstrated efficacy against influenza strains even when there was a mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains, supporting the claim of cross-protection in a mismatch season.",
