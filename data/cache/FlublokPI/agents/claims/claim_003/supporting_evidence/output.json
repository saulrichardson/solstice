      "quote": "Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture-confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any ubject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDCILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by showing that Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine) provided significant efficacy (44.8%) against all influenza strains, regardless of whether they matched the vaccine strains. This suggests a broader immune response and potential cross-protection, even in a season where the circulating strains do not match the vaccine.",

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides context for why a broader immune response and cross-protection are important. It explains that traditional immunity is often limited to specific strains, and frequent antigenic drift leads to mismatches. This sets up the rationale for why recombinant technology, which can induce broader responses, is valuable.",

These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination hibiti (HI) tib d ) requirements.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes the mechanism of action of Flublok, highlighting that it uses recombinant HA proteins to induce a humoral immune response. This is relevant because recombinant technology allows for the production of highly purified antigens, which can lead to a broader and potentially more cross-reactive immune response.",

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote notes that Flublok induces hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) responses, which are a measure of immune response breadth. The mention of diminished HI responses in very young children (compared to another vaccine) indirectly supports the idea that in adults, Flublok is expected to induce a robust and potentially broader immune response.",
