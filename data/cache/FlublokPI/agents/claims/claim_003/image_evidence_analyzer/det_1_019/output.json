  "explanation": "A two-part table listing percentages of solicited local (pain, erythema, swelling) and systemic (fever, headache, myalgia, malaise, arthralgia, etc.) adverse events by severity (any, moderate, severe) across different study groups. The table only provides safety and reactogenicity data, and does not include any immunogenicity or cross-protection outcomes, so it does not support the claim Note: Limited by image scope: only adverse event data is shown; no immunologic response metrics are present",
