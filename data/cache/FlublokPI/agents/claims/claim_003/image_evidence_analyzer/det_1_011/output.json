  "explanation": "Table presenting solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, fever) for a vaccine in adults (aged \u226550 years), including percentages of subjects reporting each reaction. The table only reports safety and reactogenicity data (local and systemic adverse events) and provides no information on immune response breadth or cross-protection, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; no immunogenicity or efficacy data are shown.",
