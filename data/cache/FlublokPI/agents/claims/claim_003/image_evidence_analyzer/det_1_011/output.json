  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "Two side-by-side tables summarizing solicited local and systemic adverse events in clinical trials comparing Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine) with placebo or a licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. Local events include injection site pain, redness, swelling; systemic events include fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, and fever. Footnotes describe severity grading, denominators, and trial registry numbers. The image presents safety/reactogenicity data and contains no information on immune response breadth or cross-protection; therefore, it does not support the claim Note: Table only shows adverse event rates; no immunogenicity or cross-protection data are provided",
