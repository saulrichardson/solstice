  "explanation": "A multi-row table presenting vaccine efficacy results from a clinical trial of Flublok (a recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine). Rows show endpoints for CDC-defined influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) and culture-confirmed cases: first restricted to strains matched to the vaccine, then to any strain regardless of match, and finally to all influenza-like illness cases. For each endpoint, the number of cases and attack rates per 100 subjects are listed for vaccine and comparator groups, followed by calculated vaccine efficacy percentages and 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses by influenza A and B are also included. Evidence: For culture-confirmed cases with any strain regardless of match to the vaccine, the table reports a vaccine efficacy of 44.6% (95% CI: 18.8\u201362.6), and for all CDC-ILI cases regardless of match, efficacy of 44.8% (95% CI: 24.4\u201360.0). The observed efficacy of the recombinant vaccine against strains not matched to the vaccine demonstrates clinical cross-protection, and thus supports the claim that recombinant technology may provide broader immune protection even in a mismatch season. Note: The table shows clinical efficacy rather than direct immunogenicity data, and does not explicitly name the season as a mismatch season or compare to non-recombinant vaccines, so interpretation relies on the assumption that non-matched strains represent antigenic mismatch.",
