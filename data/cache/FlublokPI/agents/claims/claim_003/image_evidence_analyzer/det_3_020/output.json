  "explanation": "A two-part table presenting clinical trial efficacy results for a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok) versus placebo. The upper section shows CDC-defined influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) cases restricted to vaccine-matched strains in two studies, with very high point estimates of vaccine efficacy (67.2\u201375.4%). The lower section shows culture-confirmed influenza cases \u201cregardless of match to the vaccine,\u201d listing total cases and attack rates for all strains combined, influenza A sub-type, and influenza B, with vaccine efficacy point estimates in the mid-20s to mid-50s percent (VE 23.1\u201354.4% for culture-confirmed; VE 37.2\u201349.0% for CDC-ILI). Footnotes define primary/secondary endpoints and analysis populations. The table shows overall clinical efficacy of a recombinant vaccine against both matched and all circulating strains, but it does not separately report efficacy specifically in seasons or subgroups where the circulating strains were mismatched to the vaccine. Nor does it provide immunologic breadth or cross-reactivity data (e.g., antibody titers against drifted variants). Therefore, it does not directly support the assertion that recombinant technology yields a broader immune response conferring cross-protection in a mismatch season. Note: The image is clear and legible, but limited to efficacy results without immunogenicity or strain-specific mismatch analyses.",
