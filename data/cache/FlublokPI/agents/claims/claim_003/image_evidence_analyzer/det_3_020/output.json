  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine efficacy data from a Flublok Quadrivalent trial, including number of culture-confirmed influenza-like illness cases, attack rates, relative risks, vaccine efficacy percentages and 95% confidence intervals for strains matched to the vaccine and for all strains regardless of match, with subtype A and B breakdowns. The figure provides efficacy statistics for matched and overall strains but does not present data on immune response breadth, recombinant technology, or cross-protection in a mismatch season, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear and detailed but lacks any mention of recombinant production methods or immunologic cross-reactivity in mismatch seasons.",
