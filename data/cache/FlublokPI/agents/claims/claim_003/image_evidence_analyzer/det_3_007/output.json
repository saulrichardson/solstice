  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing attack rates, relative risks (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals for different influenza strains between a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) and a comparator standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine. Evidence: For the apparent mismatched influenza B strain, the rVE is 4% with a 95% CI of \u221272% to 46%, indicating no significant cross-protection. The data for the mismatched strain show an rVE close to zero with a confidence interval crossing zero, which does not support the claim that recombinant technology provides broader cross-protection in a mismatch season (does not support the claim). Note: Strain labels are not fully visible, but the low rVE and wide CI for the mismatched strain are clear; exact strain names are assumed based on row order.",
