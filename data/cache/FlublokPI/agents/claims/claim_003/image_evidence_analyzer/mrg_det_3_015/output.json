  "claim_id": "claim_003",
  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010column table comparing four influenza vaccine platforms (egg-based standard inactivated, cell-culture inactivated, live attenuated, and recombinant) across attributes including manufacturing technology/strain source, antigen quantity/purity, expected immune response, time to production, potential for cross-protection in mismatch seasons, and regulatory approval. Evidence: Under the recombinant vaccine column, in the row for mismatch\u2010season cross-protection, the table notes a \u201cbroader immune response\u201d and explicitly calls out \u201cpotential cross-protection against mismatched strains.\u201d The claim asserts that recombinant technology elicits a broader immune response that may confer cross-protection even when the circulating strain does not perfectly match the vaccine. The table directly states that the recombinant vaccine platform yields a broader response and has demonstrated potential cross-protection in mismatch seasons, which aligns precisely with the claim. Note: The information is drawn from a summary table (page 4) rather than primary clinical trial data. Some text is small but legible; there is no indication of contradictory data elsewhere in the table.",
