  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A fragment of a table summarizing the incidence (percentages) of solicited adverse reactions (e.g., injection\u2010site and systemic events) of varying severity reported by subjects in two U.S.\u2010licensed IIV3 studies, with footnotes defining severity grades and study enrollment details. The visible portion of the table presents safety data (rates of solicited adverse events) and footnotes about study design and severity grading. There is no information on immune responses, breadth of antibody response, cross\u2010protection, or mismatch season efficacy. Therefore, this table does not provide evidence addressing the claim about recombinant technology eliciting a broader immune response or cross\u2010protection. Note: Table is partially shown and limited to safety endpoints; immunogenicity or efficacy data are not visible in this excerpt.",
