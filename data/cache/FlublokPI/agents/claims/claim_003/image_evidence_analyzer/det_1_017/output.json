  "explanation": "A partial table showing the percentage of subjects reporting severe systemic events (e.g., fever) by day after vaccination, with footnotes defining severity grades, study populations (Studies 3 and 4), and U.S.-licensed IIV3 references. No immunogenicity or cross-protection data are shown. does not support the claim because the table only presents safety data on severe systemic events and contains no information on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or recombinant technology. Note: Image is truncated and only safety/adverse event data are visible; no immunogenicity results are shown.",
