      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 4: 'An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC- ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0).' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) showed 44.8% efficacy against all influenza strains, regardless of whether the strains matched the vaccine antigens. This demonstrates cross-protection, which is the ability to protect even when there is a mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains. This supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

The quote directly states that during a season when the predominant circulating H3N2 viruses were antigenically distinct (i.e., a mismatch with the vaccine), Flublok Quadrivalent still met its pre-specified efficacy criterion.
