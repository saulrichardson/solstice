      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 4 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording. The key facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved. The document states: 'Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine.

See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.' This matches the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides explicit evidence that Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine) demonstrated 44.8% efficacy against influenza strains even when 96% of circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine. This demonstrates cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim. The quote does not mention the mechanism (broader immune response), but it does show that recombinant technology (Flublok) provided protection in the context of a mismatch, which is sufficient to support the claim as stated.",

      "quote": "The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity (\"matching\") of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while influenza A/H1N1 and type B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent relative to Comparator should be not less than 20%)",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes a large clinical trial in which Flublok Quadrivalent demonstrated efficacy against influenza illness caused by any strain, regardless of antigenic match, during a season when the predominant circulating strain was antigenically dissimilar to the vaccine. This supports the claim that recombinant technology can provide cross-protection in a mismatch season.",
