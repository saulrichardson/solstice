      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 4 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording. The key facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved. The document states: 'Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.' This matches the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides explicit evidence that Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine) demonstrated 44.8% efficacy against influenza strains even when 96% of circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine. This demonstrates cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim. The quote does not mention the mechanism (broader immune response), but it does show that recombinant technology (Flublok) provided protection in the context of a mismatch, which is sufficient to support the claim as stated.",
