      "quote": "CDC surveillance data indicated that the majority of influenza A/H3N2 wild type viruses were antigenically distinct whereas influenza A/H1N1 and type B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent relative to Comparator should be not less than 20%)",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that Flublok Quadrivalent demonstrated efficacy in a season when the predominant circulating strain (A/H3N2) was antigenically distinct from the vaccine strain, supporting the claim that recombinant technology can provide cross-protection in a mismatch season.",
