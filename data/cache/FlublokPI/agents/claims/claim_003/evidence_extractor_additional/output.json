These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) anti bod",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that Flublok uses recombinant HA proteins from three different influenza strains to induce a humoral immune response, supporting the idea that recombinant technology can generate a broader immune response.",
