An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any ubject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDCILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine) demonstrated efficacy (44.8%) against all influenza strains, regardless of whether they matched the vaccine strains. This supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides context for why cross-protection is important: due to antigenic drift, vaccine strains often do not match circulating strains. The subsequent evidence of Flublok's efficacy in mismatch seasons (as above) is thus highly relevant to the claim.",

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes the mechanism of action of Flublok, emphasizing that it uses recombinant HA proteins to induce a humoral immune response. This is relevant to the claim because the use of recombinant technology is what enables the broader immune response and potential cross-protection.",
