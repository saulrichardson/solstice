      "quote": "Flublok [In\ufb02uenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three in\ufb02uenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains puri\ufb01ed HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butter ies, and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically- de\ufb01ned lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further puri\ufb01ed by column chromatography.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly describes the production platform for Flublok, stating that recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells (Sf9 cells) using a baculovirus vector, which is the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)."

      "quote": "Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single dose, pre\ufb01lled syringes contain no natural rubber latex. Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins (\u226414.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA (\u226410 ng), and Triton X-100 (\u2264100 mcg).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides supporting evidence that the production process involves baculovirus and insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda), consistent with the BEVS platform."
