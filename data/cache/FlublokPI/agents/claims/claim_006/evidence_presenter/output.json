      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile, clear, colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in section 11 DESCRIPTION. The relevant passage states: 'Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile, clear, color less injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frug i per da (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using aba culo virus vector (Autograph a cali for nica nuclear poly he dros is virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and spacing differences due to OCR, but all factual content is preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok is produced using recombinant HA expressed in insect cells (derived from Sf9 cells) and that a baculovirus vector is used for expression. This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). No inference is required; the document provides all the necessary details."

      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in section 11 DESCRIPTION: 'Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculo virus and Spodoptera frug i per da cell proteins (\u226414.3 mcg), baculo virus and cellular DNA (\u226410 ng), and Triton X-100 (\u2264100 mcg).' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing in 'Spodoptera frug i per da').. The quote directly states that each dose of Flublok may contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda (insect) cell proteins and DNA. This provides explicit evidence that Flublok is produced using a system involving baculovirus and insect cells, which supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)."
