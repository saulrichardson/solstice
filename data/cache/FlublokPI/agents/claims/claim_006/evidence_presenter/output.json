      "quote": "It contains purified ha proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived rom Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frug i per da (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically- defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts.

      "explanation": "A very similar version of the quote appears in the document, specifically in the following passage: 'It contains purified ha proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived rom Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frug i per da (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically- defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is d ihi ll li i b l i (A hlif i l expressed in this cell line using abaculo virus vector (Autograph a cali for nica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography.' The wording is nearly identical, with only minor typographical and formatting differences due to line breaks and OCR errors.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the HA proteins in Flublok are produced in an insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae, derived from Sf9 cells of Spodoptera frugiperda) and that each HA is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus). This is a clear description of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), confirming the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS."

      "explanation": "A very similar quote appears in the document: 'Each of the three HAs is ... expressed in this cell line using abaculo virus vector (Autograph a cali for nica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing and line breaks. The core content is present and matches the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that the hemagglutinin (HA) proteins are expressed in an insect cell line using a baculovirus vector (specifically, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), which is the essence of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) described in the claim. This confirms that Flublok is produced using a novel platform involving recombinant HA expression in insect cells via BEVS."
