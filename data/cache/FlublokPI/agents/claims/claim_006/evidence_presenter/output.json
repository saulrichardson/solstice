      "quote": "It contains purified ha proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived rom Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frug i per da (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically- defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts.

      "explanation": "A very similar version of the quote appears in the document, specifically in this passage: 'It contains purified ha proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived rom Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frug i per da (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically- defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts.

The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and spacing differences.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line derived from Sf9 cells, and that each HA is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus). This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)."

      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombina hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified ha proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived rom Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frug i per da (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically- defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts.",
      "explanation": "A very similar quote appears in the document on page 3: 'Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombina hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified ha proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived rom Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frug i per da (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically- defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor typographical differences (e.g., 'recombina' instead of 'recombinant', 'rom' instead of 'from', and some spacing issues).. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that Flublok contains recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) derived from Sf9 cells of Spodoptera frugiperda. This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells. While the quote does not explicitly mention the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), the document elsewhere (page 3) states: 'expressed in this cell line using abaculo virus vector (Autograph a cali for nica nuclear polyhedrosis virus)...' This confirms the use of BEVS. Therefore, the quote, together with the surrounding context, genuinely supports the claim."

The wording is fragmented due to formatting, but the core content is present and matches the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that the hemagglutinin (HA) proteins are expressed in an insect cell line using a baculovirus vector (specifically, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), which is the defining feature of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). This confirms that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells via BEVS, as claimed."

      "quote": "Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculo virus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins (\u226414.3 mcg), baculo virus and cellular DNA (\u226410 ng), and Triton X-100 (\u2264100 mcg).",
      "explanation": "A very similar quote appears in the document: 'Each 0 5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculo virus andSpodopterafrugiperdacell proteins (\u226414.3 mcg), baculo virus and cellular DNA (\u226410 ng), and Triton X-100 (\u2264100 mcg).' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote provides specific evidence that residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda (insect) cell proteins and DNA are present in the final product. This directly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) in insect cells, as these residuals are a byproduct of such a manufacturing process. The presence of these components in the vaccine confirms the use of BEVS and insect cells in production."
