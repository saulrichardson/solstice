      "explanation": "A very similar version of the quote appears in the document, specifically in the following passage: 'It contains purified ha proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived rom Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frug i per da (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically- defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts.

The wording is nearly identical, with only minor typographical and formatting differences due to line breaks and OCR errors.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the HA proteins in Flublok are produced in an insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae, derived from Sf9 cells of Spodoptera frugiperda) and that each HA is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus). This is a clear description of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), confirming the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS.",
