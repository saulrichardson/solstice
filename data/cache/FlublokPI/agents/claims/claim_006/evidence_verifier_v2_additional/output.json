      "explanation": "A very similar quote appears in the document: 'Each 0 5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculo virus andSpodopterafrugiperdacell proteins (\u226414.3 mcg), baculo virus and cellular DNA (\u226410 ng), and Triton X-100 (\u2264100 mcg).' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote provides specific evidence that residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda (insect) cell proteins and DNA are present in the final product. This directly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) in insect cells, as these residuals are a byproduct of such a manufacturing process. The presence of these components in the vaccine confirms the use of BEVS and insect cells in production.",
