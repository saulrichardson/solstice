      "quote": "It contains purified ha proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived rom Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frug i per da (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically- defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is d ihi ll li i b l i (A hlif i l expressed in this cell line using abaculo virus vector (Autograph a cali for nica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly describes that Flublok's hemagglutinin (HA) proteins are produced in an insect cell line using a baculovirus vector, which is the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), supporting the claim of a novel production platform."
