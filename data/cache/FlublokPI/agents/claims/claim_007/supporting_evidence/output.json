      "quote": "Flublok [In\ufb02uenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three in\ufb02uenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains puri\ufb01ed HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda ... Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further puri\ufb01ed by column chromatography.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that Flublok is a recombinant HA antigen produced using the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), which is necessary context for the claim."

      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of in\ufb02uenza virus speci\ufb01ed by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote confirms that the recombinant HA antigens in Flublok induce an antibody response, which is relevant to the claim about immunogenicity."
