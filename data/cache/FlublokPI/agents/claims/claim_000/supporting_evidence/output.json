      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by stating that Flublok contains hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from the exact three strains of influenza virus that are specified by health authorities (such as WHO and FDA) for the annual vaccine. This ensures that the antigenic match is identical to the strains selected by these organizations.",

These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination hibiti (HI) tib d ) requirements.
