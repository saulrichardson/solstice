    "analysis": " The existing evidence provides strong support for the Flublok portion of the claim, clearly stating that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain (totaling 135 mcg per 0.5 mL dose for three strains). However, the evidence does not directly confirm the HA content per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine (15 mcg per strain), nor does it present a side-by-side comparison within the same context. To fully support the claim, explicit documentation of the standard-dose vaccine's HA content is needed, ideally from the same or a comparable official source. Searching the document for tables or sections that describe the composition of standard-dose influenza vaccines would help close this gap."
