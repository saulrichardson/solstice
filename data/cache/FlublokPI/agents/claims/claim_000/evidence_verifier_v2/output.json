The relevant section states: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' This matches the quote to be verified.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by specifying that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, or 45 mcg per strain for three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, thus substantiating the '3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content' portion of the claim. While the quote does not directly address immunogenicity, the claim's first and main factual assertion is fully supported by the quote.",
