      "original_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok contains recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from the three influenza virus strains specified by health authorities, which include the WHO and FDA. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with the strains selected by these organizations."
