The quote directly lists the specific influenza virus strains included in Flublok for the 2024-2025 season, which are the strains selected by health authorities (WHO and FDA) for that season. This demonstrates that Flublok is formulated to match the selected strains, supporting the claim that it ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
