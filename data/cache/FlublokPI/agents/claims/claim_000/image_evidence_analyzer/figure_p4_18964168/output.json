  "explanation": "The image is a table of influenza attack rates, relative risks, and vaccine efficacy (rVE) comparing Flublok to a U.S.-licensed quadrivalent vaccine. It lists n/N values (e.g., 138, 114, 24, 101), attack rates (2.2%, 1.7%, 0.5%, 1.3%), relative risks, and 95% confidence intervals. There is no text in the image referring to regulatory approval status or age indications. Therefore, it does not provide any evidence about Flublok being approved for adults 18 years and older.",
