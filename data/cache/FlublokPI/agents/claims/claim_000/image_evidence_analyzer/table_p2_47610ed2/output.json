  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image shows safety/reactogenicity data broken out by age strata, but there is no statement in the excerpt indicating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older. The footnotes and trial descriptions only mention Study 1 (without specifying the youngest age enrolled) and pooled data from Studies 2\u20134 in adults 50 years and older. No text in the image explicitly states an approval age of 18 years and older, so it does not provide evidence to support the claim.",
