  "explanation": "The image is a snapshot of solicited adverse\u2010event data from Flublok clinical trials and related footnotes. It reports the number of participants (e.g. 2,344 in the Flublok arm and 2,304 in the placebo arm for Study 1) and then describes three additional trials involving 2,050 adults aged 50 and older (mean age 65 years). Nowhere does the image state that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, nor does it show data for an 18\u201349 year-old cohort or regulatory approval language. Therefore, it does not provide evidence supporting the claim.",
