  "explanation": "The image is a table of efficacy data comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4,303) against a comparator, showing attack rates (e.g. 2.2% vs 3.2% for all rt-PCR\u2013positive influenza) and calculated relative risk and vaccine efficacy percentages. There is no information in the table about the ages of the participants or any regulatory approval status. Therefore the image does not supply any evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
