  "explanation": "The image shows a table of adverse\u2010event rates from clinical studies and footnotes describing study design, severity grading, and trial registration. It does not mention Flublok\u2019s approved indication or specify any age range (such as adults 18 years and older). Therefore, it provides no evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
