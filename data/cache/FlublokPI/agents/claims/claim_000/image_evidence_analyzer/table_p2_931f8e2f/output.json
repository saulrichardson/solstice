  "explanation": "The image is a fragment of a clinical data table and accompanying footnotes summarizing percentages of solicited adverse events (e.g., <1%, 6%, 1%) and definitions of fever severity (e.g., Mild \u2265100.4\u00b0F to <101.1\u00b0F; Moderate \u2265101.2\u00b0F). It refers generically to \u201cstudy vaccine\u201d and U.S.-licensed IIV3 in clinical trials 3 and 4, but it does not mention Flublok by name, nor does it state any approved age ranges or that it is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, the image provides no evidence regarding the claim about Flublok\u2019s approval for adults 18\u2009+.",
