  "explanation": "The image shows a table listing the Flublok presentation (single-dose prefilled syringe), its NDC numbers, and storage and handling instructions (e.g. refrigerate between 2\u00b0 and 8\u00b0C, do not freeze) followed by a heading for patient counseling information. There is no mention anywhere in the visible text of approved age ranges or that the vaccine is for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, the image does not provide any evidence supporting the claim about Flublok\u2019s age approval.",
