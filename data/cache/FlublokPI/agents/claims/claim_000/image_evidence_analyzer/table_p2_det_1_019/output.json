  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited adverse\u2010event rates (e.g., percentages of any, moderate, and severe reactions) from clinical studies, with footnotes about study numbers and vaccine comparators. It does not contain any information about the approved age range for Flublok or mention that it is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, it provides no evidence to support the claim about Flublok\u2019s approval age indication.",
