  "explanation": "The image is a set of tables summarizing local and systemic adverse events from Flublok clinical trials and footnotes describing study populations. It specifically notes that in Studies 2\u20134, a total of 2,050 adults age 50 and older received Flublok (and 2,048 received a comparator). There is no mention in the visible text of an approval age of 18 years or of adults 18 and older. Therefore, the image does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
