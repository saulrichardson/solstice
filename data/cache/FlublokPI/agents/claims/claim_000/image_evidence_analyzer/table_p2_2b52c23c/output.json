  "explanation": "The image shows safety data from clinical trials of Flublok, including a note that \u201cin these three clinical trials (Studies 2\u20134, Tables 2 and 3) a total of 2050 adults age 50 and older received Flublok and 2048 received a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine comparator.\u201d There is no mention of enrollment or approval in adults 18\u201349 years of age. Because the image only presents data for adults 50 and older, it does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for all adults 18 years and older.",
