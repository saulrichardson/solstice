  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial table showing percentages (mostly <1% and small integers) of subjects reporting various severe responses or adverse events across different studies, with footnotes explaining percentage thresholds, study populations, and definitions of severity such as temperature ranges for fever. The table only presents safety/adverse event data and footnotes about study design and severity definitions; it does not provide any information on antigen (HA) content or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image shows only adverse event data; antigen content and immunogenicity information are not present in the visible portion.",
