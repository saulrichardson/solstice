  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing percentages of subjects reporting fever (categorized as mild, moderate, severe) post-vaccination in various studies, with footnotes describing reporting thresholds, subject populations, and definitions of fever severity. The image contains only safety/reactogenicity data (fever rates and severity) and does not address antigenic matching of Flublok to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is adequate for identifying content; it appears to be a safety table with no antigenic match information.",
