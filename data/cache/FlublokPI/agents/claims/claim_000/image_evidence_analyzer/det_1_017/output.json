  "explanation": "A partial table listing percentages (e.g., <1%, 6, 5, 3, 2, 0) of severe responses reported by subjects in different studies of influenza vaccines, followed by footnotes explaining data reporting conventions (results \u22651%, results >0 but <1% reported as <1%), study population definitions, ClinicalTrials.gov registration information for Studies 3 and 4, and definitions of fever severity (mild, moderate). The table presents safety and reactogenicity data (percentages of severe responses and fever definitions) from clinical studies. There is no information on antigenic match, strain selection, or reference to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains. Note: The image is partial and focuses on safety endpoints; no antigenic match data are visible or implied.",
