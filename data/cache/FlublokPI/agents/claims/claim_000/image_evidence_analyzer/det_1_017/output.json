  "explanation": "A partial table showing percentages (<1, 6, 5, 3, 2, 0) of subjects reporting solicited local and systemic adverse reactions by severity grade, with accompanying footnotes defining severity, study identifiers, comparators, and trial registration information. The table presents safety/adverse event data and contains no information on antigenic match between Flublok and WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but only includes safety data; no antigenic match or strain-selection details are shown.",
