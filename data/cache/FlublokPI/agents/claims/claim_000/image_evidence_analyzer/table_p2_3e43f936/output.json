  "claim": "Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image is a fragment of a clinical\u2010study table and footnotes showing percentages of adverse events (e.g., \u201c6,\u201d \u201c<1,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d etc.) and definitions of fever grades (\u201cMild (\u2265100.4\u00b0 to <101.1\u00b0F); Moderate (\u2265101.2\u00b0F to \u2026)\u201d) along with references to U.S.-licensed IIV3 in Studies 3 and 4. There is no mention anywhere in the image of Flublok\u2019s approved age range or that it is approved for adults 18 years and older. Because the claim concerns regulatory approval by age and the image only shows safety data and study footnotes without any age-approval statement, it does not support the claim.",
