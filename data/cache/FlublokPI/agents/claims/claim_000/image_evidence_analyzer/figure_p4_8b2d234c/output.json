  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image is an excerpt from a clinical\u2010trial report showing tables of vaccine efficacy (cases, rates, % efficacy, confidence intervals) and footnotes listing study identifiers and reference citations. It does not include any label, statement, or regulatory text indicating that Flublok is approved for use in adults aged 18 years and older. All visible age references in the cited studies concern older populations (e.g. \u226550 or \u226565 years), but there is no explicit mention of an FDA or other agency approval for ages 18+. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence supporting the claim.",
