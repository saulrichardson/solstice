  "explanation": "The image is a clinical efficacy table and accompanying footnotes and references for Flublok and Flublok Quadrivalent, showing case counts, attack rates, vaccine efficacy percentages, confidence intervals, study identifiers (e.g. NCT00539981), and age groups of study participants (e.g. \u226550 years, \u226565 years). However, there is no statement about regulatory approval or an approved age range of 18 years and older. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
