  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates for Flublok (N=1,078) versus IIV3 (N=1,081). It breaks down percentages of pain, redness, swelling, fatigue, headache, etc., by severity. There is no mention of age ranges, labeling information, or any statement about approval for adults 18 years and older.
