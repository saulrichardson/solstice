  "explanation": "The image is a table showing the percentages of solicited local and systemic adverse events in two study groups\u2014Flublok (N=972) and IIV3 (N=967)\u2014but it does not include any information about the ages of the participants or regulatory approval status. There is no text in the table stating an age indication (e.g., \u201c18 years and older\u201d) or an approval statement for Flublok. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
