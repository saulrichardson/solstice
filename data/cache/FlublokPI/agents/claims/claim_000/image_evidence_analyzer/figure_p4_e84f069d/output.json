  "explanation": "The image is a table showing attack rates, relative risks (RR), and 95% confidence intervals from a vaccine efficacy study comparing a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Fluarix) with another treatment (presumably Flublok). It lists per-group attack rates (e.g. 2.2% vs. 3.2% in one row), sample sizes (n ranging from 24 to 138), RR values (0.57\u20130.96), and calculated relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) percentages (4% to 43%). Nowhere in the table or its footnotes is there any mention of age ranges, approval status, or an indication that the vaccine is licensed for adults aged 18 years or older. Therefore, this image provides no evidence to support the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
