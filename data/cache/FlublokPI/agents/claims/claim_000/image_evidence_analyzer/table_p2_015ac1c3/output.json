  "explanation": "The image is a safety and reactogenicity table comparing Flublok (N=1,078) and a comparator IIV3 (N=1,081) on solicited local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache). It does not show any information about the age of participants or an approval statement that Flublok is indicated for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence to support the claim about Flublok\u2019s age\u2010of\u2010use approval.",
