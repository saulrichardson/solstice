  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse events in two study arms: Flublok (N = 2272) and placebo (N = 2231), with percentages of reactions such as pain, redness, headache, fatigue, etc. There is no information in the table about regulatory approval status or the approved age range for Flublok. Therefore, it does not provide any evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
