  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing solicited local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) with percentage incidences for Flublok versus comparator/placebo cohorts along with explanatory footnotes on grading and study denominators. The table only presents reactogenicity data (incidence of adverse events) and does not include any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity; it therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear for adverse event data but does not include antigen content or immunogenicity measures.",
