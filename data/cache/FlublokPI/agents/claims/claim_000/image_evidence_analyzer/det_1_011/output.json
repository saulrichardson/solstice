  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

  "explanation": "A table of solicited local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) with percentage of subjects reporting each reaction in Flublok and comparator groups, plus footnotes describing study cohorts and severity definitions. The table presents safety/reactogenicity data and does not address antigenic matching or alignment with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image only contains adverse event data; no information on antigen composition or strain matching is shown.",
