  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

  "explanation": "A table of solicited local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) reported in Flublok and comparator groups, with percentages and footnotes defining severity grades, cohort sizes, and study registry information. The table presents safety and reactogenicity data and does not include any information about antigenic match or strain selection, so it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to safety/reactogenicity data; no antigenic or immunogenicity information present.",
