  "explanation": "A table reporting solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse event rates (%) for Flublok compared to a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) in adults, with footnotes describing cohort definitions, trial registrations, denominators, and severity grading. The table presents safety/reactogenicity data (local and systemic adverse event rates) and trial demographics; it does not include any information on antigenic matching or strain selection relative to WHO or FDA recommendations. Therefore, it does not address whether Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains.",
