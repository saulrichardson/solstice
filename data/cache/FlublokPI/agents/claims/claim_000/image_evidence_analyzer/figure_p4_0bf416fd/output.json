  "explanation": "The image is a table entitled \u201cAdults 18\u201349 Years of Age, Study 1\u201d showing clinical efficacy data for Flublok versus saline placebo in a trial population of 2,344 vaccinated adults aged 18\u201349. It reports case counts, attack rates, vaccine efficacy percentages, and confidence intervals. However, it makes no mention of regulatory approval, labeling, or authorized age indications. It simply presents clinical trial results in a limited age range (18\u201349) and does not by itself establish that Flublok is approved for all adults aged 18 years and older.",
