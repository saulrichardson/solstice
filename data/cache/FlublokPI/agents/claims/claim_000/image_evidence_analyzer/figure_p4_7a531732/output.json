  "explanation": "The image is a table titled \u201cAdults 18\u201349 Years of Age, Study 1\u201d comparing Flublok (N=2344) versus saline placebo (N=2304) in adults aged 18\u201349, showing numbers of influenza cases and calculated vaccine efficacy. It presents clinical trial results for that age group but does not state any regulatory approval or labeling information. Therefore, while it confirms Flublok was studied in adults 18\u201349, it does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for use in adults aged 18 years and older.",
