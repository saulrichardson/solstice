  "explanation": "The image is a table comparing the percentages of local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache) reported in clinical trial groups for Flublok (N=1,078) versus IIV3 (N=1,081). It provides no information about the age range of participants or regulatory approval status. There is no mention of \u201818 years and older\u2019 or any adult age cutoff, so nothing in this image supports the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
