  "explanation": "The image is a table of influenza attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent versus a comparator in a study population (N\u22484,300 per arm). It reports numbers of rtPCR-positive cases, attack rates (e.g., 2.2% vs. 3.2%), risk ratios, and relative vaccine efficacy percentages, but it does not include any information on the ages of participants or regulatory approval status. Therefore, it provides no evidence regarding the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
