  "explanation": "The image shows a table of adverse\u2010event frequencies (values like <1%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 6%) and footnotes explaining study populations (e.g. \u201call randomized subjects who received study vaccine\u201d), trial numbering (\u201cStudies 3 and 4\u2026\u201d), and definitions of fever severity (e.g. \u201cMild (\u2265100.4\u00b0 to <101.1\u00b0F); Moderate (\u2265101.2\u00b0F to \u2026)\u201d). There is no mention of an approved age range or indication that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so it does not support the claim.",
