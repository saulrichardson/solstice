  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, headache, fatigue) observed in 972 subjects who received Flublok and 967 who received IIV3. It shows percentages of any, moderate, and severe reactions but does not mention the age of participants, nor does it state an approval age range. Therefore, there is no information in this image indicating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
