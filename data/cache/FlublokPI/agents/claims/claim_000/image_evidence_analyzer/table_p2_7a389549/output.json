  "explanation": "The image is a table showing percentages of solicited local and systemic reactions for Flublok (N=1,078) versus IIV3 (N=1,081). It lists rates of pain, redness, swelling, fatigue, headache, etc., but contains no information about approved age ranges or regulatory indications. There is nothing in the table stating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so it does not support the claim.",
