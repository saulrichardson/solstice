The figure provides clinical efficacy data (attack rates, RR, and VE) comparing Flublok to a licensed quadrivalent vaccine, but contains no information on antigenic composition or match to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. There is no data or statement regarding sequence identity or antigenic alignment in this table.",
