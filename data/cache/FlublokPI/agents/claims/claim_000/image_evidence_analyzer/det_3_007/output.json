  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing PCR-confirmed influenza attack rates (n/N and %), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI) for subjects receiving Flublok versus a comparator quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent). Footnotes describe case definitions, comparator vaccine manufacturer, and rVE calculation. The figure provides clinical efficacy data (attack rates, RR, rVE) but contains no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains; it therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is complete for efficacy data but does not include any mention of antigenic match or strain selection; confidence is high that no relevant matching information is present.",
