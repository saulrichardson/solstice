  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial table displaying attack rates (n/N and %), relative risks (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) comparing a study vaccine versus a comparator flu vaccine, with accompanying footnotes describing PCR-confirmed influenza cases and study population details. The image presents clinical attack rate and efficacy data but contains no information on antigen (HA) content or immunogenicity comparisons. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The snippet is limited to efficacy outcomes and does not include any discussion of antigen dosage or immunogenicity measurements.",
