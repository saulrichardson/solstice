  "explanation": "A partial table showing influenza attack rates (n/N and %), sample sizes, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE with 95% CI) comparing a study vaccine versus a U.S. comparator (Fluarix Quadrivalent), along with footnotes describing PCR confirmation, comparator vaccine, and protocol details. The table presents clinical efficacy data (attack rates, RR, rVE) and does not address antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains; it does not support the claim.
