  "explanation": "A table comparing attack rates (n/N and %), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals for Flublok versus a comparator influenza vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent) across different influenza virus types/subtypes, followed by explanatory footnotes. The table presents efficacy outcomes and comparative attack rates but does not provide any data on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image focuses on clinical efficacy metrics; no antigenic characterization data are shown.",
