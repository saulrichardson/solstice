  "claim": "Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image shows a table of solicited adverse event rates (Any, Mild, Moderate, Severe) from clinical studies and footnotes explaining how events were collected and which vaccines were used in each study. There is no mention anywhere in the table or footnotes of the age of the subjects (for example, \u201818 years and older\u2019) or of the approved indication. Because the claim concerns the age-approval of Flublok and the image only presents safety data without any reference to age ranges or regulatory approval, it does not provide evidence to support the claim.",
