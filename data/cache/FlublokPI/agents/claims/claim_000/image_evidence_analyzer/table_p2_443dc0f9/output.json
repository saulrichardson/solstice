  "explanation": "The image shows a safety table reporting percentages of solicited adverse events (e.g. pain, redness, swelling, systemic events) in different study arms and footnotes about how results were collected and reported. There is no text in the table or footnotes referring to the approved age range for Flublok or any licensing indication. Therefore, this image does not provide any evidence about Flublok being approved for adults 18 years and older.",
