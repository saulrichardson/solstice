  "explanation": "The image is a table of clinical\u2010efficacy results (attack rates, relative risks, confidence intervals) comparing Flublok (recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine) to a licensed quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. It lists numbers of subjects, attack rates (%), relative risk (RR), and 95% CIs, but it does not mention any age ranges or approval indications. There is no text in the table or the footnotes stating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so the image does not provide evidence for that claim.",
