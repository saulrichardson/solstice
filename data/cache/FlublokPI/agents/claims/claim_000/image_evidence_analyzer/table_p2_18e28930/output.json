  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse\u2010event rates observed in a clinical trial comparing Flublok (N=972) to IIV3 (N=967). It reports percentages for pain, redness, headache, fatigue, etc., but contains no information about Flublok\u2019s approved age range or regulatory status. Therefore, it does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
