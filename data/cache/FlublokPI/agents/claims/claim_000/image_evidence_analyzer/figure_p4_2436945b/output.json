  "explanation": "The image is a partial excerpt from a clinical study report or prescribing information showing tables of influenza-like illness case counts, attack rates, vaccine efficacy percentages, confidence intervals, and study references. There is no text anywhere in the visible excerpt stating the approved age range for Flublok (for example, \u201capproved for adults 18 years and older\u201d). The tables and footnotes describe efficacy endpoints, strain matching, and study populations (including some studies in persons \u226550 or \u226565 years), but nothing about the formal age indication or approval. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults aged 18 years and older.",
