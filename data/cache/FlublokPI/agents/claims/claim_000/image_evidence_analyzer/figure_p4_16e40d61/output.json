  "explanation": "The image is an excerpt from a clinical\u2010trial results table showing attack rates (n/N), relative risks (RR), and vaccine efficacy (VE) percentages (with 95% CIs) comparing Flublok to a comparator influenza vaccine. It lists numbers of cases, percentages, and calculated VEs (e.g., 30% [10, 47], 36% [14, 53], etc.), but it does not include any information about the age groups studied or the approved age indication. There is no text in the image stating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so it does not provide evidence for that claim.",
