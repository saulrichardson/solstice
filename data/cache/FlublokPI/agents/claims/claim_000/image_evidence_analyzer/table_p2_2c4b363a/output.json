  "explanation": "The image is a table of percentages of solicited adverse reactions (moderate and severe) from vaccine studies, with footnotes describing study design and reporting conventions. It does not include any information on the approved age range for Flublok nor any text indicating that it is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, it provides no evidence for the claim about Flublok\u2019s age indication.",
