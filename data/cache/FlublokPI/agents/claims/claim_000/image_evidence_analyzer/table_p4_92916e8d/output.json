  "explanation": "The image shows a table of product presentations and NDC numbers (e.g. single-dose prefilled syringe 49281-724-10), followed by section 16.2 on storage and handling (refrigeration between 2\u00b0 and 8\u00b0C, do not freeze, etc.) and section 17 on patient counseling information. There is no mention of an approved age range or that the vaccine is for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, this excerpt does not provide evidence supporting the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
