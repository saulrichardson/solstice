  "explanation": "The image is a table of clinical trial results showing attack rates, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals for influenza outcomes. It includes footnotes about the comparator (Fluarix Quadrivalent) and describes study subjects and case definitions. There is no information in the table or footnotes about the age range of approval for Flublok (for example, \u201c18 years and older\u201d). Therefore, this image does not provide any evidence about the approved age indication of Flublok.",
