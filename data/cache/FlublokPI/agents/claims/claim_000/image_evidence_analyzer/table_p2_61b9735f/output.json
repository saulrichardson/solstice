  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (e.g. pain, redness, headache, fatigue) for Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231). Nowhere in the table does it specify the ages of the participants or note that the vaccine is only approved for adults aged 18 years and older. Because there is no mention of age or approval criteria in the image, it does not provide evidence for the claim that \u201cFlublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.\u201d",
