  "explanation": "The image is a data table summarizing clinical\u2010trial efficacy endpoints (rtPCR-confirmed influenza attack rates, relative risk, relative vaccine efficacy) for Flublok Quadrivalent versus a comparator, with total subject counts (N=4 303 for Flublok, N=4 301 for comparator). There is no mention of age groups, labeling, or regulatory approval language in the image. It therefore does not provide any information about Flublok\u2019s approval status for adults 18 years and older.",
