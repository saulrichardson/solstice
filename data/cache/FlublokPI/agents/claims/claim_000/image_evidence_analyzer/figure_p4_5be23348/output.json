  "explanation": "The image is a segment of an efficacy table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N = 4303) to a comparator (N = 4301), listing attack rates, relative risks, and vaccine efficacy percentages for different influenza endpoints. Nowhere in the visible text does it specify the ages of the participants (for example, \u201c18 years and older\u201d), nor does it state any approved age range. Therefore, while it shows efficacy data, it does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
