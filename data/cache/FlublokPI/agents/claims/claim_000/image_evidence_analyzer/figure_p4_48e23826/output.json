  "explanation": "The image is a table presenting clinical\u2010efficacy data for Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4,303) versus a comparator (N=4,301). It shows attack rates (% and n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE%) for outcomes such as all RT-PCR\u2013positive influenza (2.2% vs. 3.2%), influenza A (1.7% vs. 2.7%), influenza B (0.5% vs. 0.6%), and culture-confirmed, protocol-defined ILI (1.3% vs. 2.3%). Nowhere in the table is there any information about the age of study participants or FDA approval status. There is no mention of an 18-year-and-older age indication, so the image does not provide evidence supporting the claim that \u201cFlublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.\u201d",
