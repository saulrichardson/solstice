  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse\u2010event rates for Flublok (N=972) versus an IIV3 comparator (N=967). It lists percentages of pain, redness, headache, fatigue, etc., but does not include any information about the age range of study participants or approval status by age. Therefore, this table provides no evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
