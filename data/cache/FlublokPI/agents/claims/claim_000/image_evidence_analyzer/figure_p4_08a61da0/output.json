  "explanation": "The image is a series of clinical trial data tables and footnotes showing numbers of influenza cases, attack rates per group, calculated vaccine efficacy percentages (with 95% confidence intervals), and bibliographic references for Flublok studies. It reports efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza-like illness in various age cohorts (including substudies in adults \u226550 and \u226565 years old) but does not include any regulatory or prescribing information stating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older. There is no text in the image specifying the approved age indication, so it does not support the claim.",
