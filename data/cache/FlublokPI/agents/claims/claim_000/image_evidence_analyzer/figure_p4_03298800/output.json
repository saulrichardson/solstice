  "explanation": "The image is a table reporting influenza attack rates, relative risks (RR) and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals for a study comparing Flublok to a U.S.-licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccine. It lists the number of cases (n/N), attack rates, RR and rVE, and includes footnotes about PCR confirmation and protocol deviations. There is no information in the table about age groups or approval status\u2014no mention of adults, children, or a minimum age of 18 years. Therefore, this image does not provide any evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
