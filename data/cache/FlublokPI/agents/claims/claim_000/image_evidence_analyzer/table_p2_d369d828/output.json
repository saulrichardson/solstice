  "explanation": "The image is an excerpt of adverse\u2010event tables and study footnotes from clinical trials of Flublok. It lists the number of vaccinated subjects (e.g. 2,344 in the Flublok arm of Study 1), defines severity grades, and notes that in Studies 2\u20134 a total of 2,050 adults age 50 and older (mean age 65) received Flublok. Nowhere in the image is there any statement about regulatory approval or an approved age range of 18 years and older. The data pertain only to trial populations and adverse events; they do not address or confirm approval status for adults 18 and up.",
