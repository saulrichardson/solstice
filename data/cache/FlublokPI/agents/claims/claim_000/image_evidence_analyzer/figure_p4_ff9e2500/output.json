  "explanation": "The image is a table of clinical-trial efficacy results for Flublok (Study 1, NCT00539981), showing numbers of influenza-like illness cases (e.g. 1 vs. 4 matched\u2010strain CDC-ILI cases, VE 75.4%, 95% CI \u2013148.0, 99.5) and other endpoints (any ILI, subtypes A and B, culture\u2010confirmed cases). There is no information in the table about the ages of the trial participants or the approved age range for the vaccine. Therefore, this image does not provide any evidence regarding Flublok\u2019s approval status for adults 18 years and older.",
