  "explanation": "The image shows a table of solicited adverse\u2010event rates (e.g., injection site pain, headache) from Studies 3 and 4 comparing Flublok with U.S.-licensed IIV3 vaccines, plus footnotes defining severity grades and referencing clinical trial registrations. There is no text in the image indicating any approval status, prescribing information, or age indications for Flublok. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
