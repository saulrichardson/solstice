  "explanation": "The image is a table reporting results from a clinical trial of Flublok versus saline placebo in adults aged 18\u201349 (N=2,344 for Flublok, N=2,304 for placebo), showing case counts, rates, and vaccine efficacy percentages against various influenza endpoints. It simply demonstrates that the vaccine was studied in an 18\u201349 age group and quantifies efficacy; it does not state or imply regulatory approval for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, it does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for that population.",
