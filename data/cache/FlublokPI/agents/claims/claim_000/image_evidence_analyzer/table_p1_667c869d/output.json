  "explanation": "The image shows the table of contents from the full prescribing information for Flublok, listing sections such as \u201c8.4 Pediatric Use\u201d and \u201c8.5 Geriatric Use,\u201d but it does not include any text about age-based indications or state that Flublok is approved only for adults 18 and older. Since no part of the visible text specifies an approved age range or that the vaccine is limited to those 18 years and older, this image does not provide evidence supporting the claim.",
