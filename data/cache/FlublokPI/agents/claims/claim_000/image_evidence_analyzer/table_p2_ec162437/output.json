  "explanation": "The image is a table comparing rates of local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, headache, fatigue) for Flublok (N=972) versus IIV3 (N=967). It lists percentages of any, moderate, and severe reactions but makes no mention of the age of the study participants or the approved age range for the vaccine. Therefore, it does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
