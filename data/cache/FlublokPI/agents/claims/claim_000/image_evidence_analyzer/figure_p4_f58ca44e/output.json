  "explanation": "The image is a clinical\u2010trial results table showing attack rates (%), sample sizes (n), relative risks (RR), and 95% confidence intervals for Flublok versus a comparator vaccine. It includes footnotes on PCR confirmation, comparator vaccine identity, and efficacy calculations. There is no mention of age eligibility, approval status, or any statement that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so it does not provide evidence for the claim.",
