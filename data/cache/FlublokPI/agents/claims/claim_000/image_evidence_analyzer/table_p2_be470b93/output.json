  "explanation": "The image is a table of local and systemic adverse event rates for Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231). It reports percentages of pain, redness, headache, fatigue, etc., but it does not include any information about the approved age range for Flublok or specify that it is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence supporting the claim about age approval.",
