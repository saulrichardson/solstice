  "explanation": "The image is a table of clinical trial outcomes (attack rates, relative risks, and relative vaccine efficacy with 95% confidence intervals) for Flublok versus a comparator influenza vaccine. It reports numbers of subjects (n), percentages of influenza cases, and efficacy estimates. There is no mention in the image of any age range or approval status, and no text indicating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, the image does not provide evidence supporting the claim about Flublok\u2019s approval age.",
