  "explanation": "The image is a table comparing percentages of local and systemic adverse events for Flublok (N=1,078) versus IIV3 (N=1,081). It lists rates of pain, redness, fever, fatigue, headache, etc., but contains no information about age indications or regulatory approval. Therefore, it does not provide any evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
