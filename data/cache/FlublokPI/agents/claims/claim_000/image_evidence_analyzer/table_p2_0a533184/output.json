  "explanation": "The image shows tables of solicited local and systemic reactions from clinical trials of Flublok. The footnotes and text refer to study populations of adults aged 50 and older (mean age 65) and summarize reactogenicity data in those older cohorts. There is no statement in the image about FDA approval or authorization, nor any indication that Flublok is approved for adults aged 18 years and older. Therefore, the image does not provide evidence supporting the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
