  "explanation": "The image is a snippet of Flublok\u2019s prescribing information showing:  \n\u2022 A table of presentations with carton and component NDC numbers for single-dose prefilled syringes (0.5 mL)  \n\u2022 Section 16.2 on storage and handling (temperature requirements, freezing, light protection, expiration)  \n\u2022 Section 17 heading for patient counseling information  \n\nNowhere in this excerpt is there any statement about the approved age range or that Flublok is for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, the image does not provide evidence supporting the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
