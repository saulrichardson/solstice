  "explanation": "The image is a side-by-side table of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (%) for Flublok (N=1,078) versus a standard inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3, N=1,081). It lists events such as injection-site pain, redness, fatigue, headache, etc., broken down by any, moderate, and severe reactions. There is no mention of patient age ranges or regulatory approval status in this table\u2014nothing indicates the vaccine was studied or approved specifically in adults 18 years and older. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence to support the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
