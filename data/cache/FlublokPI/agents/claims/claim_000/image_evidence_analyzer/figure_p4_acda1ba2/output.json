  "explanation": "The image is an excerpted efficacy table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4 303) to a comparator vaccine (N=4 301) across endpoints such as \u2018All rtPCR-positive influenza\u2019 and \u2018All culture-confirmed, protocol-defined ILI,\u2019 reporting case counts (n), attack rates (%), relative risks (RR) and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE %, 95% CI). There is no mention of approved age ranges, labeling, or any statement that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence for the claim about Flublok\u2019s age indication.",
