  "explanation": "The image is a set of clinical efficacy data tables and footnotes for Flublok vaccine trials (attack rates, relative risks, confidence intervals, and strain types). It does not include any information about regulatory approval or age indications, nor does it state that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, it does not support the claim about the vaccine\u2019s approved age range.",
