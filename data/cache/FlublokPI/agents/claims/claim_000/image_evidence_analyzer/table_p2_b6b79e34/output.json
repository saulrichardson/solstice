  "explanation": "The image is a table summarizing the percentages of local (e.g., pain, redness, swelling) and systemic (e.g., fatigue, headache, myalgia) reactions observed in clinical trial subjects who received Flublok. It lists rates of any, moderate, and severe adverse events but does not include any information on the approved age range or labeling indication. Therefore, it does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
