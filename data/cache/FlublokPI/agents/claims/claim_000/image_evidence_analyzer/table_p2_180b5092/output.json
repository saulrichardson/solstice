  "explanation": "The image is a table showing the incidence of local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, headache, fatigue) in a clinical trial of Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231). It provides percentages of \u2018Any\u2019, \u2018Moderate\u2019, and \u2018Severe\u2019 reactions but makes no mention of age ranges, labeling, or approval criteria. There is no text indicating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so the image does not support the claim.",
