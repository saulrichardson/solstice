  "explanation": "The image is a table of clinical trial results (attack rates, relative risk, and relative vaccine efficacy) comparing Flublok to a quadrivalent influenza vaccine. It includes numerical data on influenza case rates and efficacy estimates (e.g., rVE of 30% [10, 47] and 43% [21, 59]), but it does not mention any regulatory approval status or age indication. There is no text in the image stating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so it does not provide evidence to support the claim.",
