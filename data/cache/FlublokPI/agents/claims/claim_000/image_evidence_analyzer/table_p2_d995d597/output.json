  "explanation": "The image is a set of tables reporting solicited local and systemic adverse-event rates from clinical trials of Flublok (e.g. pain, fatigue, headache percentages, trial registry numbers, and descriptions of study populations such as \u201ca total of 2050 adults age 50 years and older received Flublok\u201d). Nowhere in the excerpt is there an explicit statement that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older. It merely presents safety data from different adult cohorts (including those \u226550), without any regulatory or labeling language indicating an approval age of \u226518. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
