  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (Any, Moderate, Severe) for Flublok (N = 972) versus IIV3 (N = 967). It lists percentages for pain, redness, swelling, headache, fatigue, etc., but it does not mention approved indications, age ranges, or regulatory approval status. There is no reference in the table to \u201818 years and older\u2019 or any age-specific approval, so the image does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
