  "explanation": "The image is an excerpt of clinical\u2010trial safety data for Flublok, showing solicited local and systemic adverse events in study participants.  The bottom of the excerpt even notes \u201cIn these three clinical trials \u2026 a total of 2,050 adults age 50 and older received Flublok,\u201d and no part of the visible text refers to approval status or an 18-year-and-older age indication.  There is no statement in the image that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so it does not support the claim.",
