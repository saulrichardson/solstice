  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates for Flublok (N=972) versus a comparator vaccine (IIV3, N=967). It lists percentages of pain, redness, headache, fatigue, etc., but does not mention the age of participants or any regulatory approval language. There is no reference to an 18-year-and-older population or an approval statement in the image, so it does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
