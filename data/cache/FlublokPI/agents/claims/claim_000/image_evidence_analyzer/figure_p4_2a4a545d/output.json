  "explanation": "The image is a table comparing the efficacy of Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4,303) versus a comparator (N=4,301) by showing attack rates for rtPCR-positive influenza A and B, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy percentages with 95% confidence intervals. There is no mention of age groups, labeling of subjects as \u201cadults,\u201d or any approval language. Because the table only presents efficacy data and does not state that Flublok is approved for adults aged 18 years and older, it does not provide evidence supporting that claim.",
