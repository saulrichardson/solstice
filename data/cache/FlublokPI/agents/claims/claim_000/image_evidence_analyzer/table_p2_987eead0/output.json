  "explanation": "The image is a safety table comparing adverse event rates for Flublok (N=1,078) and IIV3 (N=1,081), showing percentages of local reactions (pain, redness, swelling) and systemic reactions (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, etc.). There is no information in this table about the approved age range for Flublok or any indication that it is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, the image does not provide evidence supporting the claim.",
