  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates for Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231), listing percentages of pain, redness, swelling, headache, fatigue, etc. There is no information in the table about the ages of the study participants or the FDA\u2010approved age indication for Flublok. Therefore, while it provides safety data, it does not address or support the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
