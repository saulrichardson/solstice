  "explanation": "The image is a table of clinical\u2010efficacy results (attack rates, relative risks, confidence intervals) comparing Flublok with a comparator vaccine. It does not include any approval language or specify that Flublok is licensed for adults aged 18 years and older. Because there is no mention of regulatory approval or age indication in the table or its footnotes, it does not provide evidence to support the claim that \"Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.\"",
