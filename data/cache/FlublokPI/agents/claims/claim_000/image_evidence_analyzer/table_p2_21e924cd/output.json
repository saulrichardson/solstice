  "explanation": "The image shows a fragment of a table reporting percentages of subjects with adverse events (e.g. \u201c1\u201d, \u201c<1\u201d, \u201c6\u201d) and footnotes describing study designs (e.g. \u201cFor Studies 3 and 4, the U.S.-licensed IIV3 and Fluria, respectively\u2026 registered as NCT\u2026\u201d). There is no mention of Flublok by name, nor any statement about the vaccine\u2019s approved age range (e.g. adults 18 years and older). Therefore, this image does not provide any evidence to support the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
