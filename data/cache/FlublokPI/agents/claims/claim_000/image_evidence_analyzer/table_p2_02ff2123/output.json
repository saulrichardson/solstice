  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse events (percentages of mild, moderate, and severe responses) from clinical studies of an influenza vaccine, including footnotes about study design. There is no information in the table or its notes about the age of study participants or the age range for which the vaccine is approved. Therefore, the image does not provide any evidence to support (or contradict) the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
