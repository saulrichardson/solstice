  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited adverse\u2010event rates (any, moderate, severe) from Flublok clinical studies, with footnotes about data collection and comparators. It contains no text about regulatory approval or the indicated age range for Flublok. There is no mention of \u2018approved for adults 18 years and older\u2019 or any age\u2010related indication in the visible content, so it does not provide evidence for the claim.",
