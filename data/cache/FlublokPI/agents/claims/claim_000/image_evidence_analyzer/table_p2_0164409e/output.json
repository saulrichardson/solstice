  "explanation": "The image is a fragment of a clinical\u2010trial adverse\u2010event table showing percentages of mild, moderate, and severe reactions in different study arms. It includes footnotes about study registration and comparators but makes no mention of Flublok\u2019s approved age range or regulatory approval status. There is no text or data indicating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so the image does not support the claim.",
