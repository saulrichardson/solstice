  "explanation": "The image is a table summarizing the frequency and severity of solicited adverse reactions (e.g., pain, redness, swelling) reported in clinical studies of Flublok. It lists percentages of subjects experiencing various side effects but contains no information about the age groups for which Flublok is approved. Therefore, it does not provide any evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
