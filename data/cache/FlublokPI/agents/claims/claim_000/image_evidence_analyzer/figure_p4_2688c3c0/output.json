  "explanation": "The image is a tabular summary of PCR-confirmed influenza cases, showing for each group the number of cases (n/N), attack rates, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals. It does not mention the age of study participants or regulatory approval criteria. There is no text indicating that Flublok is approved for adults aged 18 years and older, so the image provides no evidence to support the claim.",
