  "explanation": "The image is a table comparing rates of local and systemic adverse events for Flublok (N=972) versus IIV3 (N=967). It lists percentages for pain, redness, headache, fatigue, etc., but does not state the age of the participants or mention any regulatory approval criteria. There is no reference to an 18-year-and-older age indication, so the table provides no evidence for the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
