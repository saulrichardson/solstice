  "explanation": "The image is a clinical-trial efficacy table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4,303) to a comparator (N=4,301), showing attack rates, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) for rt-PCR\u2013positive influenza A and B, as well as culture-confirmed ILI. There is no information in the table about regulatory approval status or the authorized age groups for Flublok. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
