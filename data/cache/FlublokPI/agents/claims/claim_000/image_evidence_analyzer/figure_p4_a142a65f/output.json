  "explanation": "The image is a table of efficacy results (attack rates, relative risks, and relative vaccine efficacies) for Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4,303) versus a comparator (N=4,301). It reports outcomes such as \u2018All rtPCR-positive Influenza\u2019 and subtypes A and B, but nowhere does it state the age range of participants or mention regulatory approval for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, it provides no evidence regarding the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
