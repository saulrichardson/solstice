  "explanation": "The image is an excerpt of a table reporting the frequency and severity of solicited adverse events in vaccine study subjects, with footnotes describing study design and comparator vaccines (Fluarix, Fluzone) and definitions of mild and moderate reactions. There is no mention in the visible text of the ages of participants or an approved age indication for Flublok. Therefore, it does not provide any evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
