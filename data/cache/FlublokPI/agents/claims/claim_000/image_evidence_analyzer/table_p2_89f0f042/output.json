  "explanation": "The image is a safety table comparing solicited local and systemic adverse events for Flublok (N=2,272) versus placebo (N=2,231). It lists percentages of pain, redness, swelling, headache, fatigue, etc., but makes no mention of participant ages or an age-18+ approval. Therefore, while it demonstrates safety data, it does not provide any evidence about Flublok being approved for adults 18 years and older.",
