  "explanation": "The image is a table summarizing the percentages of local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, etc.) adverse events in a clinical trial of Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231). It contains no information about the age of participants or regulatory approval criteria, and therefore does not address whether Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
