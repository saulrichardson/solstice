  "explanation": "The image is a snapshot of adverse\u2010event tables and trial descriptions for Flublok. At the bottom it specifically refers to \u201cthree clinical trials (Studies 2 \u2013 4, Tables 2 and 3) [involving] a total of 2050 adults age 50 and older\u201d who received Flublok. There is no mention anywhere in the visible text of approval or study populations beginning at age 18. Thus the image provides evidence for use in adults 50 and older, but does not support the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
