  "explanation": "The image presents tables of adverse\u2010event rates from clinical studies in which all Flublok recipients were adults age 50 and older (mean age 65), and the footnote explicitly states \u201c2050 adults age 50 and older received Flublok.\u201d There is no mention of approval or study data in adults aged 18\u201349, nor any regulatory approval language for ages 18 and up. Therefore, the image does not support the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
