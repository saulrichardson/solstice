  "explanation": "The image is a set of clinical trial tables and footnotes reporting local and systemic adverse events in subjects who received Flublok or a comparator vaccine. The footnote at the bottom even states \u201cAcross three clinical trials (Studies 2\u20134)\u2026 a total of 2050 adults age 50 and older received Flublok\u2026\u201d There is no text in this image indicating regulatory approval or specifying that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older. Instead, it only shows study data for participants aged 50 years and older, so it does not support the claim about approval for adults 18 years and older.",
