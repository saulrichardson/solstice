  "claim": "Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image is an excerpt from clinical study tables and footnotes describing adverse events in subjects who received Flublok. It specifically details results from studies in adults age 50 and older (mean age 65) and gives safety data (pain, fatigue, headache, etc.). There is no statement in the image about the FDA-approved age indication for Flublok, nor any reference to approval for adults 18 years and older. Consequently, the image does not provide evidence to support the claim.",
