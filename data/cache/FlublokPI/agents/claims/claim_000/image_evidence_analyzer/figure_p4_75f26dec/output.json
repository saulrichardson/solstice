  "explanation": "The image is an excerpt of a vaccine efficacy table and accompanying footnotes and references. It reports attack rates and relative risks for CDC-ILI and culture-confirmed influenza in study cohorts, and cites trials in populations \u201c\u226565 years old\u201d and \u201c\u226550 years of age.\u201d Nowhere in the visible text does it state that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, nor does it present any regulatory approval language or an indication covering the 18+ age group. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence supporting the claim.",
