  "explanation": "The image is an excerpt from clinical\u2010trial data and references for Flublok, showing numbers of influenza\u2010like illness cases, attack rates, relative risks, confidence intervals, trial identifiers (e.g. NCT00539981), and age cohorts in individual studies (such as persons \u226565 or \u226550 years old). It does not include any statement about the FDA approval or the labeled indication for Flublok\u2019s use in adults aged 18 years and older. Therefore, it does not provide evidence supporting the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
