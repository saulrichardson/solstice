  "explanation": "The image is a table of contents from the full prescribing information for Flublok, listing sections such as Indications and Usage (Section 1), Dosage and Administration (Section 2), and Use in Specific Populations (Section 8, including Pediatric Use in 8.4 and Geriatric Use in 8.5). Nowhere in the visible text does it state the approved age range (for example, \u201818 years and older\u2019). Therefore, this excerpt provides no direct evidence that Flublok is approved only for adults aged 18 years and older.",
