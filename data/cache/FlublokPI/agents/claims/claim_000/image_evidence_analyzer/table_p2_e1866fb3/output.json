  "explanation": "The image is an excerpt from clinical trial data for Flublok, showing the frequencies of local and systemic adverse events and describing the age of the trial cohorts (e.g., \u201ca total of 2050 adults age 50 and older received Flublok\u201d). There is no mention anywhere in the image of regulatory approval or an approved age indication of 18 years and older. Therefore, the image does not provide any evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
