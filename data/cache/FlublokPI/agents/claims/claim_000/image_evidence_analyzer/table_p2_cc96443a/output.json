  "explanation": "The image is a table comparing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates for Flublok (N=972) versus a comparator (IIV3, N=967). It lists percentages of pain, redness, headache, fatigue, etc., but it does not mention the approved age range for Flublok or any indication that it is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, it provides no evidence regarding the age approval of the vaccine.",
