  "explanation": "The image is a table of efficacy data comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4,303) to a comparator (N=4,301), listing numbers of rt-PCR\u2013confirmed influenza cases, attack rates, relative risks, and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with confidence intervals. There is no mention of age ranges, patient demographics, or regulatory approval criteria in the table. Therefore, this image does not provide any evidence about the fact that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
