  "explanation": "The image is a clinical efficacy table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) to a comparator (N=4301), showing attack rates, relative risks, and relative vaccine efficacy percentages for rtPCR-positive influenza outcomes. There is no information about the approved age range for Flublok or any mention of adults aged 18 years and older. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence to support the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
