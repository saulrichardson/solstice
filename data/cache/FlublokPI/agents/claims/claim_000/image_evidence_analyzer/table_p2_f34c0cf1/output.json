  "explanation": "The image is a table showing solicited local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse event rates (%) for a Flublok group (N=2,272) versus a placebo group (N=2,231). It provides safety/reactogenicity data but does not mention the approved age indication or specify that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, it does not provide evidence supporting the claim about the vaccine\u2019s age approval.",
