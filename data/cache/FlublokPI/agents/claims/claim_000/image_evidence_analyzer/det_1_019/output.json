  "explanation": "The image shows a table of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (e.g., injection site pain, erythema, swelling; fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, etc.) reported by subjects in multiple clinical studies, broken down by severity categories and percentage of subjects. Footnotes reference Study 2 and Study 4 and the U.S.-licensed IIV3 comparator. The table presents safety and reactogenicity data only and does not support the claim about antigenic matching; there is no information on strain matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim.",
