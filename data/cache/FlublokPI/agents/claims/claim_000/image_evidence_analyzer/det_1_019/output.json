  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing percentages of subjects reporting solicited adverse reactions (injection site and systemic) by severity (any, moderate, severe) across multiple studies, with footnotes describing study populations and definitions. does not support the claim because the table presents safety and adverse event data, not hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity comparisons. Note: Table appears to focus on adverse events; no antigen dose or immunogenicity data are shown.",
