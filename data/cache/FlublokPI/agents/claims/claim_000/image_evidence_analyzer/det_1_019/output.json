  "explanation": "A multi-row table summarizing solicited local and systemic adverse events reported by subjects in randomized vaccine studies, showing percentages of participants experiencing any, moderate, or severe events (e.g., pain, erythema, swelling, fever) with footnotes defining the study populations and comparator vaccines. The table presents safety data (incidence and severity of adverse events) and contains no information on antigenic composition or strain matching. There is no mention of WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains or any antigenic match data. Note: The visible portion of the table appears complete for safety outcomes but does not address antigenicity; image is clear for its content.",
