  "explanation": "The image is a partial page from a clinical study report or labeling document showing a table of efficacy results (case counts, attack rates per 100 person-years, vaccine efficacy percentages, and 95% confidence intervals) for Flublok versus placebo, followed by footnotes and a reference list. Nowhere in the visible text does it state the approved age range for Flublok or specify that it is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, this image provides no direct evidence to support the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
