  "explanation": "The image is an excerpt of a clinical-trial efficacy table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent to a U.S.-licensed comparator (Fluarix Quadrivalent). It shows attack rates (n/N and %), relative risks (RR) and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE with 95% CI) against different influenza strains. There is no mention of the approved age range or an indication that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence regarding Flublok\u2019s age-approval status.",
