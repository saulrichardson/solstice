  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image is a table of local and systemic adverse event rates and footnotes from clinical trials of Flublok, specifically noting that in Studies 2\u20134 a total of 2,050 adults age 50 and older received Flublok (mean age 65 years). There is no language about regulatory approval or indication for adults 18 years and older. Because the image only presents safety data in a 50+ population and does not state any approved age range, it does not support the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
