  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse events observed in a clinical trial (Flublok N=2272 vs placebo N=2231), showing percentages of participants reporting pain, redness, headache, fatigue, etc. It does not state any regulatory approval status or specify the age range of participants (e.g. adults 18 years and older). Therefore, it provides no evidence regarding whether Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
