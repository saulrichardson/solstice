  "explanation": "The image is a table titled \u201cAdults 18\u201349 Years of Age, Study 1\u201d showing the number of influenza cases and calculated vaccine efficacy for Flublok versus saline placebo in a clinical trial of adults aged 18\u201349. It reports case counts, rates, and efficacy percentages (for example, 44.6% efficacy against culture-confirmed ILI, all strains, with a 95% CI 18.8\u201362.6). However, it does not include any information about regulatory approval or recommended age indications. Therefore, while it shows that Flublok was studied in adults 18\u201349, it does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
