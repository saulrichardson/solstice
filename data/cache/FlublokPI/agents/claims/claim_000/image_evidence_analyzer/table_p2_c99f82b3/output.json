  "explanation": "The image is an excerpt from clinical trial data tables and footnotes that describe adverse event rates in subjects who received Flublok. The visible text refers to trials in \"adults age 50 and older\" (mean age 65) and provides denominators and age ranges for those studies. There is no mention anywhere in the excerpt of approval for, or study in, adults 18 years and older. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence supporting the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
