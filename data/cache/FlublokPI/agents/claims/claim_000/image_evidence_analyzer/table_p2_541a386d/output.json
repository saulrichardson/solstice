  "explanation": "The image is a two\u2010column table showing the percentages of local and systemic adverse events reported in two study populations (Flublok, N=972; IIV3, N=967). It lists solicited reactions such as pain, redness, headache, fatigue, etc., with their overall, moderate, and severe frequencies. There is no information about regulatory approval or the approved age range for Flublok anywhere in the table. Therefore, this image does not provide any evidence regarding whether Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
