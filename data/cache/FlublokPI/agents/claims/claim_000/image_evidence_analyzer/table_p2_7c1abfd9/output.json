  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates for Flublok versus a comparator (IIV3), reporting percentages of pain, redness, fatigue, headache, etc., in each group (N=1078 for Flublok). There is no information in the table about age groups, age limits, or regulatory approval status. Therefore, it does not provide any evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
