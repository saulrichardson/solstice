  "explanation": "The image is a table summarizing influenza attack rates, relative risks, and vaccine efficacy comparisons between Flublok and a comparator (Fluarix Quadrivalent). It shows numerical data (attack rate percentages, sample sizes, relative risks, 95% confidence intervals, and calculated relative vaccine efficacy) but does not contain any information about approval status or age indications. There is no text in the image stating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so it does not support the claim.",
