  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse events comparing Flublok (N=1078) to IIV3 (N=1081), with percentages of pain, redness, fatigue, headache, etc. It contains no information about approved age ranges or regulatory indications, and does not mention adults or an 18-year age threshold. Therefore, it does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
