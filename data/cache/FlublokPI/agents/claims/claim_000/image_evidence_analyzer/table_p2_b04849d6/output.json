  "explanation": "The image is a table summarizing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates for Flublok (N = 1078) versus IIV3 (N = 1081), broken down by any, moderate, and severe reactions (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, etc.). There is no information in the table about the vaccine\u2019s approved age range or indication. It simply presents safety data and does not state that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so it does not support the claim.",
