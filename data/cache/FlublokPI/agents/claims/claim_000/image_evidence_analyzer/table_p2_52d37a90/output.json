  "explanation": "The image shows a fragment of a clinical-trial safety table (percentages of adverse events \u22651% in various study arms) and explanatory footnotes defining severity grades and referencing Studies 3 and 4. There is no text in the image that states any approved age range or indicates that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, the image does not provide evidence supporting the claim about the adult age indication.",
