  "explanation": "The image is a table of efficacy results (attack rates, relative risk, and relative vaccine efficacy) for Flublok Quadrivalent versus a comparator in the trial population (N = 4,303 for Flublok and N = 4,301 for comparator). It provides counts of rt-PCR-positive influenza cases and culture-confirmed ILI but does not report any age distribution or age-related inclusion criteria. There is no indication in the table that participants were adults aged 18 years and older, so it does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for that age group.",
