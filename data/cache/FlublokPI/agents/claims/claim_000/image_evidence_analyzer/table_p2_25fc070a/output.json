  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates for Flublok (N=1,078) versus a standard influenza vaccine (IIV3, N=1,081). It lists percentages for pain, redness, fatigue, headache, etc., but does not include any information about the ages of the trial participants or the approved age range for Flublok. Therefore, it provides no evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
