  "explanation": "The image is a table showing clinical trial results (attack rates, relative risks, and relative vaccine efficacy percentages) for Flublok versus a comparator vaccine. It lists numbers of subjects (e.g., n\u2009=\u2009138, 114, 24, 101), attack rates (e.g., 3.2%, 2.7%, 0.6%, 2.3%), RR values (e.g., 0.70, 0.64, 0.96, 0.57), and calculated rVE (e.g., 30%, 36%, 4%, 43%), but it does not include any information about the approved age range for Flublok. There is no text stating \u201capproved for adults 18 years and older\u201d or any other age-based approval language. Therefore, the image does not provide evidence either supporting or refuting that specific regulatory claim.",
