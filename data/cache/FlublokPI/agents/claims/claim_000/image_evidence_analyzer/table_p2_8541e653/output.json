  "explanation": "The image is a table comparing local and systemic adverse event rates for Flublok (N=1,078) versus a comparator influenza vaccine (IIV3, N=1,081). It lists percentages of pain, redness, fatigue, headache, etc., but does not mention any age ranges or approval status. There is no indication in the table text that Flublok is approved specifically for adults 18 years and older, so it provides no evidence for the claim.",
