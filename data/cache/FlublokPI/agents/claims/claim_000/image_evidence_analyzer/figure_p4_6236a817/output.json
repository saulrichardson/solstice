  "explanation": "The image shows a clinical\u2010trial table with attack rates (n/N and %), relative risks (RR), and vaccine efficacy (VE %) with 95% confidence intervals for Flublok versus a comparator influenza vaccine. Footnotes define terms like PCR, N, and VE. There is no mention anywhere of age groups, approval status, or that Flublok is indicated for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, this image does not provide any evidence supporting the claim.",
