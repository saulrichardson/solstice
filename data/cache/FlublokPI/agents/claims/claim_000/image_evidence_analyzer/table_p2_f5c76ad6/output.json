  "explanation": "The image is a fragment of a clinical\u2010trial safety table and footnotes, showing percentages of solicited adverse events and definitions of severity levels. It refers to \u2018all randomized subjects who received study vaccine,\u2019 study identifiers (e.g. NCT01365462), and temperature criteria for fever, but contains no information about the age range of subjects or an approval statement specifying that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, it does not support the claim.",
