  "claim": "Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image is a table titled \u201cAdults 18-49 Years of Age, Study 1\u201d showing the number of cases and vaccine efficacy of Flublok versus placebo in a clinical trial population aged 18\u201349 years. It reports case counts (e.g. 44 vs. 78 for CDC-defined ILI, all strains) and corresponding efficacy percentages (e.g. 44.6% [95% CI 18.8, 62.6]). However, the table only describes study results in 18\u201349 year-olds and does not state any regulatory approval status or age indication. There is no mention that Flublok is approved for adults aged 18 years and older. Therefore, the image does not provide evidence supporting the claim.",
