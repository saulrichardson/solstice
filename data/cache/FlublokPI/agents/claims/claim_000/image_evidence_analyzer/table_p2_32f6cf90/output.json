  "explanation": "The image displays a safety-data table of solicited reactions (percentages of mild, moderate and severe events) from clinical studies of Flublok versus comparator vaccines, along with explanatory footnotes on grading of fever and study registration numbers. There is no mention anywhere in the visible text of an approved age range or specific authorization for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, this image provides no evidence to support the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
