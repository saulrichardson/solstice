  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Black-and-white screenshot of the first page of the Flublok full prescribing information. It shows the table of contents listing sections such as Indications and Usage, Dosage and Administration, Dosage Forms and Strengths, Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions, Adverse Reactions, Clinical Pharmacology, Clinical Studies, References, and How Supplied/Storage and Handling. The visible text includes section titles and a few bullet points on adverse reactions but no detailed data or statements about antigenic matching. The image only displays the table of contents and section headings of the Flublok prescribing information. There is no language in this excerpt about antigenic match or references to WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains. Therefore, it does not provide any evidence\u2014direct or indirect\u2014supporting the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. Note: The snippet is limited to the table of contents and does not include the full Description or Clinical Pharmacology sections, where antigenic composition might be discussed. However, based solely on the visible content, there is no support for the claim.",
