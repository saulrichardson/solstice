  "explanation": "The image is an excerpt from a clinical trial report showing case counts, attack rates, vaccine efficacy percentages, and confidence intervals for Flublok versus placebo. It includes footnotes on study design (e.g. NCT00539981), endpoints (CDC-ILI, culture-confirmed), and references, but does not contain any information about patient ages or regulatory approval criteria. There is no mention of an approved age range (such as 18 years and older), so it does not provide evidence for the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
