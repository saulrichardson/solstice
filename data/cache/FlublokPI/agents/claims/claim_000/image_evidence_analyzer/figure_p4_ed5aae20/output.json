  "explanation": "The image is a fragment of a clinical\u2010efficacy table and a list of literature references for the Flublok vaccine. It shows numbers of influenza cases, attack rates, vaccine efficacy percentages, confidence intervals, and citations to studies in various age groups (e.g. \u226550 years, \u226565 years). However, there is no text or label in this excerpt that states Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, nor any mention of regulatory approval or the 18 + age indication. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence to support the claim.",
