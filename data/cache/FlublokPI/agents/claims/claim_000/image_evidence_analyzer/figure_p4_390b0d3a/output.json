  "explanation": "The image is a fragment of a clinical\u2010efficacy table comparing attack rates (n/N and %), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE with 95% CI) of Flublok versus a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Fluarix) in different subject groups. It reports numbers of subjects (for example, n=138, attack rate 3.2%, RR=0.70, rVE=30% (10, 47)) but contains no information about regulatory approval status or the specific age indication for Flublok. There is no text in the image stating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so it does not support the claim.",
