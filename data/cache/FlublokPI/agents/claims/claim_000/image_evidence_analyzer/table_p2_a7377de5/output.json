  "explanation": "The image is a two-column table comparing the frequencies of local and systemic adverse events for Flublok (N=972) versus IIV3 (N=967). It lists percentages for pain, redness, headache, fatigue, etc., but contains no information about age groups or approved ages for Flublok. Therefore, it does not provide any evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
