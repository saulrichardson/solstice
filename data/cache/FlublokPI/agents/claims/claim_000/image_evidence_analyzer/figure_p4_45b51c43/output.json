  "explanation": "The image is a table comparing efficacy (\u201cattack rate % (n/N)\u201d) of Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4,303) versus a comparator (N=4,301) for various influenza endpoints. It reports the number of cases and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE %) with 95% CIs, but it does not include any information on the ages of participants or approval status. There is no text indicating that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so the image does not support the claim.",
