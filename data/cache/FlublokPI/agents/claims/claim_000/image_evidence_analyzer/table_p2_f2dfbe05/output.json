  "explanation": "The image shows safety/reactogenicity data from clinical trials of Flublok in adults age 50 and older (e.g. \u201ca total of 2050 adults age 50 and older received Flublok\u2026\u201d and tables of local and systemic reactions in an older\u2010adult cohort). There is no mention of subjects aged 18\u201349 or an approval age range beginning at 18 years. Therefore, this excerpt does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
