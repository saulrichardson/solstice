  "explanation": "The image shows a table of percentages of solicited adverse reactions (Any, Moderate, Severe) reported in different study groups, along with footnotes about study registration and data reporting. There is no text in this image indicating an age range, labeling of adult subjects, or approval status (e.g., \u2018approved for 18 years and older\u2019). Therefore, this image does not provide any evidence to support the claim that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
