  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-row, multi-column table summarizing results from multiple clinical studies of the Flublok influenza vaccine. Columns include the number of cases in vaccine and placebo groups, attack rates, percentage vaccine efficacy with 95% confidence intervals, and footnotes describing study design, endpoints (CDC-defined influenza-like illness, culture-confirmed influenza), and notes on strain characterization/genetic sequencing. The table presents clinical efficacy data (attack rates, vaccine efficacy percentages, confidence intervals) against influenza-like illness and culture-confirmed influenza. Although footnotes mention whether isolated viruses were antigenically matched to vaccine strains, there is no reference to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, nor any statement that Flublok \u2018ensures identical antigenic match\u2019 with WHO/FDA recommendations. The figure does not address antigenic matching standards set by regulatory agencies. Note: The image is clear and legible; however, no sections of the table refer to WHO or FDA strain selections. There are no indications of regulatory antigenic matching in the displayed data.",
