  "explanation": "A table summarizing vaccine efficacy endpoints for FluBlok Quadrivalent versus a licensed quadrivalent inactivated vaccine. It lists the number of cases, attack rates (%) in each group, calculated vaccine efficacy (%) with 95% confidence intervals, for CDC-defined influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) with matched strains, PCR-confirmed ILI with matched strains, and culture-confirmed cases regardless of match; includes footnotes defining primary and secondary analyses, case definitions, and notes on antigenic characterization and sequencing. The table presents efficacy data against influenza-like illness caused by matched and all strains and provides statistical outcomes (attack rates, relative risk, VE%, confidence intervals). It does not include any statement or data demonstrating that FluBlok\u2019s antigen composition is identical to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. There is no information on antigenic match procedures or confirmation that the vaccine antigens are the same as those selected by regulatory bodies. Note: Portions of the figure (e.g., headings or footnotes) may be partially obscured or truncated, but no text indicating identical antigenic match to WHO/FDA recommendations is visible.",
