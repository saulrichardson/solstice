  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing vaccine efficacy outcomes for Flublok Quadrivalent versus comparator/placebo, showing numbers of culture-confirmed influenza-like illness cases, attack rates, vaccine efficacy percentages, and 95% confidence intervals, along with explanatory footnotes and references. does not support the claim because the table presents clinical efficacy data and does not provide any information about hemagglutinin antigen content or comparisons of antigen doses between Flublok and standard-dose vaccines. Note: The image quality is sufficient to see efficacy endpoints but contains no data on antigen content or immunogenicity measures.",
