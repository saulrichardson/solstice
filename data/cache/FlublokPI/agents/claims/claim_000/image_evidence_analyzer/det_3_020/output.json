  "explanation": "Table displaying vaccine efficacy data for Flublok versus placebo, reporting numbers of cases per group for CDC-defined influenza-like illness and culture-confirmed influenza (both matched strains and any strains), relative risks, vaccine efficacy percentages with 95% confidence intervals, plus footnotes and references. The image presents efficacy outcomes and incidence data but does not provide any information on antigenic matching processes or confirm that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No details on strain selection, antigenic characterization, or WHO/FDA matching are shown; footnotes indicate full genetic/antigenic sequencing was not performed for all cases.",
