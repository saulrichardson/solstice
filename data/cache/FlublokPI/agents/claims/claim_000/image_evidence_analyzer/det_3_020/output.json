  "explanation": "A tabular summary of influenza vaccine efficacy data for Flublok, showing culture-confirmed flu cases stratified by whether the infecting strain matched the vaccine strain (all matched strains, sub-types A and B) versus any strain, with corresponding attack rates, relative risk reductions, and 95% confidence intervals. Footnotes describe study design, case definitions, and note that some analyses are post hoc and that genetic sequencing was not performed on all samples. does not support the claim because the table reports efficacy against matched versus any strains but does not mention WHO- or FDA-selected strain matching or provide data on antigenic identity with those selected strains Note: No mention of WHO or FDA selection criteria in the figure; footnotes are partially truncated but do not reference regulatory strain selection",
