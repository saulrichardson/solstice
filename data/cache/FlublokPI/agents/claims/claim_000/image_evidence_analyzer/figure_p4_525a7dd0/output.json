  "explanation": "The image is a table of clinical trial results (attack rates, relative risks, and vaccine efficacy percentages) and accompanying footnotes and references. It summarizes influenza\u2010like illness outcomes in Flublok vs. placebo groups, with some sub\u2010analyses (e.g. persons \u226565 years old in one reference), but it does not include any information on the approved age range or regulatory indication for Flublok. There is no statement in the image that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, so it does not support the claim.",
