  "explanation": "The image is a portion of a clinical study table and accompanying footnotes describing adverse event rates (e.g., percentages of subjects reporting mild, moderate, or severe reactions) and study design details (Studies 3 and 4, symptom severity definitions, etc.). There is no text in the image that mentions the approved age range for Flublok or specifies that it is licensed for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, the image does not provide any evidence supporting the claim about Flublok\u2019s approval for adults 18 years and older.",
