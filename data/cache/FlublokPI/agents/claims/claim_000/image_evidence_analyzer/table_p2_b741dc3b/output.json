  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates in two study arms (Flublok, N=2272, and placebo, N=2231). It lists percentages of events such as pain, redness, headache, fatigue, etc. There is no mention of approval status or the approved age range (e.g., 18 years and older). Therefore, the image does not provide any evidence about Flublok\u2019s approval for adults 18 years and older.",
