  "explanation": "The image is a two-arm safety table comparing percentages of local (pain, redness, swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, etc.) reactions for Flublok (N=1,078) versus a standard inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3, N=1,081). It reports only adverse\u2010event rates and severity grades; it does not mention the age of the study participants or the approved age range for Flublok. Therefore, it provides no evidence regarding Flublok\u2019s approval for adults 18 years and older.",
