  "explanation": "The image is a table of vaccine efficacy results comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4,303) to a comparator (N=4,301), showing attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy against PCR-confirmed influenza and culture-confirmed ILI. There is no mention of the age of the participants (for example, \u201c18 years and older\u201d) nor any statement about regulatory approval. Therefore, this image does not provide evidence that Flublok is approved for adults aged 18 and older.",
