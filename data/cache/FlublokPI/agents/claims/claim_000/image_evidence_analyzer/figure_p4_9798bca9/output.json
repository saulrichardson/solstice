  "explanation": "The image is a table titled \u201cAdults 18\u201349 Years of Age, Study 1\u201d showing efficacy data for Flublok versus saline placebo in a clinical trial population aged 18\u201349. It reports case counts, percentages, vaccine efficacy and confidence intervals, but makes no mention of regulatory approval or an approved age indication. Therefore, while it shows that Flublok was studied in adults starting at age 18, it does not provide evidence that it is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
