  "explanation": "The image is a table of influenza attack rates, relative risks, and vaccine efficacy percentages for different study groups, but it contains no information about the approved age range or regulatory approval for Flublok. There is no mention of adult age groups (e.g., 18 years and older) or approval status, so it does not support the claim.",
