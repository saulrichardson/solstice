  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, etc.) adverse\u2010event rates for Flublok (N=2,272) versus placebo (N=2,231). It contains no information about the ages of study participants or the vaccine\u2019s approved age range. Therefore, it does not provide any evidence that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older.",
