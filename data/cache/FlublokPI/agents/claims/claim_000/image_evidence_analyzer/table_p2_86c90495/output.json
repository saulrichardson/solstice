  "explanation": "The image is a table of solicited local and systemic adverse\u2010reaction rates for Flublok (N=1,078) versus a standard inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3; N=1,081). It lists percentages of participants experiencing pain, redness, swelling, fatigue, headache, etc., broken down by severity. There is no mention anywhere in the table of the ages of the study participants or of any regulatory approval age range. Because the table provides only safety data and does not state that Flublok is approved for adults 18 years and older, it does not support the claim.",
