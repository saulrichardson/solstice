  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing sources of variability and content specifications for three influenza vaccines (Flublok, Agriflu, Fluzone HD), including hemagglutinin (HA) content per strain: Flublok 135 \u00b5g, Agriflu 15 \u00b5g, Fluzone HD 60 \u00b5g. Evidence: Flublok HA content is 135 \u00b5g per strain versus 15 \u00b5g in standard-dose vaccines The table shows that Flublok contains substantially more HA antigen than standard-dose vaccines (135 \u00b5g vs 15 \u00b5g), but it does not present any immunogenicity data; therefore, it does not support the claim in full because it lacks evidence linking the higher antigen content to greater immunogenicity. Note: Immunogenicity outcomes are not included in the table; content values are clear and legible.",
