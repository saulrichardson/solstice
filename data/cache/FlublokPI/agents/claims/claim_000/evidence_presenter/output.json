(1)' appears almost verbatim in the document on page 1 under the section DOSAGE FORMS AND ADMINISTRATION.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok is approved for use in persons 18 years of age and older, which directly supports the claim that Flublok Quadrivalent is approved for adults 18 years and older."

The wording is slightly spaced and hyphenation is inconsistent ('quad rival ent' instead of 'quadrivalent'), but the core content and numbers match exactly.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent has been administered to adults 18 years and older (including a specific study with 998 adults aged 18-49 and another with 4328 adults 0 years and older), which directly supports the claim that Flublok Quadrivalent is approved for adults 18 years and older."

The wording is slightly spaced and hyphenation is inconsistent (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' instead of 'Quadrivalent'), but the core content matches exactly.. The quote explicitly states that Study 7 enrolled adults aged 18 through 49 years who received Flublok Quadrivalent, demonstrating clinical use in adults 18 years and older. This supports the claim that Flublok Quadrivalent is approved for adults 18 years and older by showing clinical trial enrollment in this age group, which is a basis for approval."

The wording is slightly different with spacing and minor formatting differences, but the core content matches exactly.. The quote directly states that Flublok Quadrivalent was studied and administered to adults aged 18 through 49 years, which supports the claim that Flublok Quadrivalent is approved for adults 18 years and older. The clinical trial enrollment of adults starting at age 18 substantiates the age indication for approval."
