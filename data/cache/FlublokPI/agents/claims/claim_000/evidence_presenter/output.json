      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine.",
      "explanation": "The quote 'Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine.' appears in the document in section 12.1 Mechanism of Action. The wording is a direct match, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, punctuation) that do not alter the meaning.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. This directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it confirms that the antigens used are those specified by the relevant health authorities for each season."
