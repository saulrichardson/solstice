      "explanation": "A nearly identical quote appears in the document: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' The wording and content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly lists the specific influenza virus strains included in Flublok for the 2024-2025 season, which are the strains selected by health authorities (WHO and FDA) for that season. This demonstrates that Flublok is formulated to match the selected strains, supporting the claim that it ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains."
