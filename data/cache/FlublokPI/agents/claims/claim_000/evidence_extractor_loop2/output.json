      "relevance_explanation": "This quote specifies that Flublok contains a total of 135 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per dose, which is three times the standard 45 mcg HA content found in standard-dose flu vaccines (15 mcg per strain)."

These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) anti bod",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that the HA proteins in Flublok serve as antigens to induce an immune response, supporting the claim that higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity."
