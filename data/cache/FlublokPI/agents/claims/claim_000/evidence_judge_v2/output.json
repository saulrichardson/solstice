  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "document": "FlublokPI",
  "judgment": {
    "verdict": "unsupported",
    "reasoning": "Found insufficient evidence: 0 direct, 1 indirect.",
    "detailed_analysis": "The verdict of \"unsupported\" is appropriate because, while there is direct evidence confirming Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, there is no direct evidence comparing this to the 15 mcg HA per strain in standard-dose influenza vaccines within the provided sources. The main gap is the lack of a single source explicitly stating both values side by side, making the claim only partially substantiated. The strongest evidence confirms Flublok's HA content, but the comparison to standard-dose vaccines remains indirect.",
