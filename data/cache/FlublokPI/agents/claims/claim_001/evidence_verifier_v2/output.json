This is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines (though the document does not state the standard-dose content, the quote confirms the Flublok content). However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines.
