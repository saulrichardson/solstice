      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document, specifically in the following passage: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' The wording and numbers are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation). All technical content and facts are preserved.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by specifying that Flublok contains 45 mcg HA per strain, totaling 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines (though the standard is not stated in this quote, the Flublok content is clearly established). However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the claim about antigen content, but not the immunogenicity comparison. Since the task is to verify if the quote supports the claim, and the claim is primarily about antigen content, the quote is considered supportive.",
