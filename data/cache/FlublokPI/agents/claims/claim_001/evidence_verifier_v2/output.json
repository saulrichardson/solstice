      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document with only minor formatting differences. The relevant section states: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' This matches the quote in content and numbers.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by specifying that Flublok contains 135 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA from each of three strains. This is three times the standard 45 mcg HA per dose found in standard-dose flu vaccines (which typically contain 15 mcg HA per strain for three strains). However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Based solely on the document, the quote substantiates the antigen content claim but not the immunogenicity comparison.",
