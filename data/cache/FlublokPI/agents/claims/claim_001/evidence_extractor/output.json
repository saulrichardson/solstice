      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states the total and per-strain hemagglutinin (HA) content in Flublok, confirming it contains 135 mcg HA per dose (45 mcg per strain), which is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines."

      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that the HA proteins in Flublok are the immunogenic components responsible for inducing an immune response, directly linking HA content to immunogenicity."
