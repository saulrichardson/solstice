      "relevance_explanation": "This quote specifies that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, totaling 135 mcg HA per dose, which is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain (45 mcg total) found in standard-dose flu vaccines."

      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant Ha proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) anti bod",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that the HA proteins in Flublok serve as antigens to induce an immune response, supporting the claim that higher HA content is linked to immunogenicity."
