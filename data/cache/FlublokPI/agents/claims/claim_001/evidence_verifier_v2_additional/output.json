      "explanation": "A very similar quote appears in the document: 'Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: ...' The wording and numbers match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and punctuation differences.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA for each of 3 strains. Standard-dose flu vaccines typically contain 15 mcg HA per strain (total 45 mcg per dose), so this confirms Flublok has 3x the HA antigen content. This directly supports the first part of the claim. While the quote does not itself address immunogenicity, it provides the factual basis for the increased antigen content, which is the key point of the claim.",
