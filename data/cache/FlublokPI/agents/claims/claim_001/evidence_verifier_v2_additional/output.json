      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant Ha proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) anti bod ies to each virus strain. HI antibody titers induced by Flublok were generally higher than those induced by a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) comparator in adults 50 years of age and older.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document, specifically in the section under '12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action.' The document states: 'Flublok contains recombinant Ha proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) anti bod ies to each virus strain.' Additionally, the document states: 'HI antibody titers induced by Flublok were generally higher than those induced by a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) comparator in adults 50 years of age and older.' The factual content and meaning of the quote are preserved, though minor formatting and spacing differences exist due to OCR cleanup.. The quote directly supports the claim. It confirms that Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins (antigens) from three influenza strains and that these induce a humoral immune response measured by HI antibody titers. Critically, it explicitly states that HI antibody titers induced by Flublok were generally higher than those induced by a standard-dose IIV3 comparator in adults 50 years and older. This directly links Flublok's higher HA content (as described elsewhere in the document: 'it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains') to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines, as measured by HI titers. Thus, the quote genuinely and explicitly supports the claim.",
