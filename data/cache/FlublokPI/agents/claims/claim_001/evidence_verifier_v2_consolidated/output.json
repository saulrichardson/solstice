This matches the quote in content and numbers.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by specifying that Flublok contains 135 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA from each of three strains. This is three times the standard 45 mcg HA per dose found in standard-dose flu vaccines (which typically contain 15 mcg HA per strain for three strains). However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Based solely on the document, the quote substantiates the antigen content claim but not the immunogenicity comparison.",

It confirms that Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins (antigens) from three influenza strains and that these induce a humoral immune response measured by HI antibody titers. Critically, it explicitly states that HI antibody titers induced by Flublok were generally higher than those induced by a standard-dose IIV3 comparator in adults 50 years and older. This directly links Flublok's higher HA content (as described elsewhere in the document: 'it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains') to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines, as measured by HI titers. Thus, the quote genuinely and explicitly supports the claim.",

The leftmost column lists Hemagglutinin (HA) content per strain. The remaining columns show geometric mean hemagglutination inhibition titers (HI GMT) and seroconversion rates for H3N2 following vaccination with each product. Evidence: Flublok is listed with 45 \u00b5g HA per strain versus 15 \u00b5g HA per strain for the comparator vaccines (3\u00d7 HA content). The immunogenicity columns show higher HI GMTs and similar or higher seroconversion rates. The table explicitly reports that Flublok contains 45 \u00b5g of HA antigen per strain compared to 15 \u00b5g in standard\u2010dose vaccines (3\u00d7 more), and pairs this with immunogenicity data (HI GMT and seroconversion rates) demonstrating that the higher antigen dose yields equal or superior immune responses. Thus it directly supports the claim that Flublok has three times the HA content, which is correlated here with greater immunogenicity.",
