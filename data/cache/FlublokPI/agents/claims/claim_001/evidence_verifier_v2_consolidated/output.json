      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document with only minor formatting differences. The relevant section states: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by specifying that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA from each of three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain (45 mcg total) found in standard-dose flu vaccines. While the quote does not explicitly state the increased immunogenicity, it provides the factual basis (antigen content) that underpins the claim, and the link between higher antigen content and greater immunogenicity is well established in the context of flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.",
