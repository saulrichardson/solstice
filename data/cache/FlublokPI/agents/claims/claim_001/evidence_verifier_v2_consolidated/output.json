The factual content, numbers, and technical details are preserved and match the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA per strain for three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines (though the document does not state the standard-dose content, the quote confirms the Flublok content). However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the claim about antigen content but does not provide evidence for the immunogenicity comparison.",
