      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant Ha proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) anti bod ies to each virus strain. HI antibody titers induced by Flublok were generally higher than those induced by a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) comparator in adults 50 years of age and older.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that Flublok induces higher hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers compared to standard-dose IIV3, supporting the claim that its higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity.",
