      "relevance_explanation": "This quote references the hemagglutinin (HA) content and immunogenicity of Flublok, specifically noting the immune response (HI responses) in a population, which is directly related to the claim about HA content and immunogenicity. It supports the claim by discussing immunogenicity outcomes in a comparative context.",
