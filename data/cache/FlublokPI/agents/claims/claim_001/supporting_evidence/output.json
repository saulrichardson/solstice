      "relevance_explanation": "This quote specifies that Flublok contains 135mcg of HA per 0.5mL dose, which is 45mcg HA per strain. Standard-dose flu vaccines typically contain 15mcg HA per strain, so this demonstrates that Flublok contains 3 times the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines.",

Data Animal In a developmental toxicity study, female rats were administered Flublok by intramuscular injectiontwiceprior tomating(35days and14days prior tomating) andongestationDay 6. The total dose was 0.5 mL (divided) on each occasion (a human dose is 0.5 mL). No vaccine-related fetal malformations or variations and no adverse effects on pre-weaning [Page 4] The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol-defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 - [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent/ Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5).",
