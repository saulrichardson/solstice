      "quote": "For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document with only minor formatting and punctuation differences. The relevant section states: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' This matches the quote to be verified.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by specifying that Flublok contains 135 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA for each of three strains. Standard-dose flu vaccines typically contain 15 mcg HA per strain (total 45 mcg per dose), so this is three times the standard amount. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity, but it does fully substantiate the claim about HA content."

      "explanation": "The quote '5. TreanorJJ, Schiff GM, Hayden fg, et.al. Safety and immunogen i city of aba culo virus expressed hemagglutinin influenza vaccine: a randomized controlled trial. JAMA. 2007 Vol. 297, pp. 1577-1582.' appears on page 4 of the document, in the references section. The wording and citation details match the quote to verify, with only minor spacing and capitalization differences.. The referenced study (Treanor et al., JAMA 2007) is cited in the context of clinical studies comparing the immunogenicity of Flublok (which contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines) to standard-dose vaccines. The study specifically evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a baculovirus-expressed hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (Flublok) and is widely recognized as a key source demonstrating that higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim."

      "explanation": "A very similar version of the quote appears in the references section on page 4: '3 Keitel WA Tre an or JJ El Sahly HM et al Comparative immunogen i city of recom- nant influenza hemagglutinin (rHA) and trivalent in activated vaccines (TIVs) among rsons \u226565 years old Vaccine 2009 Vol 28 pp 379 385'. The wording and citation match the quote to verify, with only minor spacing and line breaks.. The referenced study is cited in the context of immunogenicity comparisons between Flublok (which contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines) and standard trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIVs) in persons \u226565 years old. The document's reference to this study directly supports the claim that increased HA content (as in Flublok) is associated with greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines. The citation is used to substantiate the immunogenicity advantage linked to higher HA content, thus supporting the claim."

The quote directly states that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA for each of 3 strains. Standard-dose flu vaccines typically contain 15 mcg HA per strain (total 45 mcg per dose), so this confirms Flublok has 3x the HA antigen content. This directly supports the first part of the claim. While the quote does not itself address immunogenicity, it provides the factual basis for the increased antigen content, which is the key point of the claim."
