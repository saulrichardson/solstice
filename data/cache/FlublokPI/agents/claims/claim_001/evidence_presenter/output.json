  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",

      "quote": "For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document with only minor formatting differences. The relevant section states: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' This matches the quote in content and numbers.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by specifying that Flublok contains 135 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA from each of three strains. This is three times the standard 45 mcg HA per dose found in standard-dose flu vaccines (which typically contain 15 mcg HA per strain for three strains). However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Based solely on the document, the quote substantiates the antigen content claim but not the immunogenicity comparison."

      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant Ha proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) anti bod ies to each virus strain. HI antibody titers induced by Flublok were generally higher than those induced by a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) comparator in adults 50 years of age and older.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document, specifically in the section under '12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action.' The document states: 'Flublok contains recombinant Ha proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) anti bod ies to each virus strain.' Additionally, the document states: 'HI antibody titers induced by Flublok were generally higher than those induced by a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) comparator in adults 50 years of age and older.' The factual content and meaning of the quote are preserved, though minor formatting and spacing differences exist due to OCR cleanup.. The quote directly supports the claim. It confirms that Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins (antigens) from three influenza strains and that these induce a humoral immune response measured by HI antibody titers. Critically, it explicitly states that HI antibody titers induced by Flublok were generally higher than those induced by a standard-dose IIV3 comparator in adults 50 years and older. This directly links Flublok's higher HA content (as described elsewhere in the document: 'it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains') to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines, as measured by HI titers. Thus, the quote genuinely and explicitly supports the claim."
