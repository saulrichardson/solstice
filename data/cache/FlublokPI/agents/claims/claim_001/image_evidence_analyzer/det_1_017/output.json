  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Partial table showing percentages of subjects reporting adverse events (e.g., <1%, 1%, 6%) across studies, followed by footnotes describing study populations, definition of severity grades, and study registration details. does not support the claim because the table and accompanying text present safety and adverse event data without any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparisons of antigen dosage in Flublok versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Note: Limited to data visible; image does not include any antigen content information.",
