  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular excerpt showing percentages of subjects reporting fever grades (e.g., <1%, 1%, 2%, 3%, etc.) with footnotes defining severity and study populations, likely from a clinical study\u2019s reactogenicity data. The table includes notes on results rounding (<1%), definitions of mild and moderate fever, study identifiers, and participant counts. does not support the claim because the table presents reactogenicity (fever) incidence data and contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative immunogenicity of Flublok versus standard-dose vaccines. Note: The image appears cropped and focused on adverse event rates; no antigen content or immunogenicity measures are visible.",
