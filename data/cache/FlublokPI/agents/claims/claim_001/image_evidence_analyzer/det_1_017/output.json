  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial table showing percentages of subjects reporting severe responses (categorized as \u22651% or <1%) across different study vaccines, with footnotes describing severity grading criteria, study populations, and references to U.S.-licensed IIV3 (A/California, B/Brisbane) and clinical trial registration. No information on antigen content or immunogenicity is present. The table presents adverse event rates and severity definitions for different influenza vaccines but contains no data on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative immunogenicity, thus it does not support the claim. Note: Table is partially visible with some text cut off, but no HA content information appears present.",
