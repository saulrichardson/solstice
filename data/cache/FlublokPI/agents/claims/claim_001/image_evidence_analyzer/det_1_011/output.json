  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse event percentages for Flublok versus a comparator flu vaccine, with footnotes describing study cohorts, safety grading, and trial identifiers. The table only reports reactogenicity (safety/adverse event) data and does not include any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image shows only safety data; no antigen content or immunogenicity metrics visible.",
