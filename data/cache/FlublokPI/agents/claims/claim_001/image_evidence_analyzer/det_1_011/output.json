  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table displaying solicited local and systemic reactogenicity (adverse event) rates for a pooled cohort of adults receiving an influenza vaccine (presumably Flublok) and comparators, showing percentages for pain, redness, firmness/swelling (local) and fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, and fever (systemic). The table provides safety/reactogenicity data and does not include information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity outcomes, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Table context is partially cut off and focuses solely on adverse event rates, with no antigen dose or immunogenicity data.",
