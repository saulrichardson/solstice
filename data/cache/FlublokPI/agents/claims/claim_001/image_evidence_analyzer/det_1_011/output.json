  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two tables summarizing solicited local and systemic adverse events in adult subjects vaccinated in clinical trials. The left table lists percentages of solicited symptoms (e.g., fatigue, headache, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) by severity for Flublok versus placebo cohorts. The right table lists pooled percentages of local (pain, redness, swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, fever) reactogenicity for Flublok and a comparator vaccine, with footnotes describing trial registration, cohort definitions, and symptom grading. The image only presents safety/reactogenicity data and does not include information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim.",
