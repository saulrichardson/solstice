  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table listing seasonal influenza vaccines, their strains, hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain, total HA per dose, adjuvant/formulation, approved age, route, and dose volume. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent contains 45 \u00b5g HA per strain, total 180 \u00b5g per dose, compared to standard-dose IIV4 vaccines containing 15 \u00b5g HA per strain, total 60 \u00b5g per dose. The table shows that Flublok contains 3\u00d7 the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines but does not present any data on immunogenicity, and thus does not support the claim that this higher content is linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
