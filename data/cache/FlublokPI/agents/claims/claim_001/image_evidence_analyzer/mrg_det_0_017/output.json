  "explanation": "Page from Flublok full prescribing information showing table of contents and sections on indications, dosage and administration, dosage forms and strengths, contraindications, warnings, adverse reactions, use in specific populations, description, clinical pharmacology, nonclinical toxicology, clinical studies, references, and storage. The image does not present any data on the hemagglutinin antigen content of Flublok or compare it to standard-dose influenza vaccines, and thus does not support the claim.",
