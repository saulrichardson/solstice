  "claim_id": "claim_001",
  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table reporting percentages of solicited adverse events (any, moderate, severe) by symptom across different studies and vaccine groups. The table shows rows of percentages (often <1%, up to 37%) for various solicited reactions, along with footnotes describing population and study numbering. The table presents safety data (incidence and severity of solicited adverse events) from clinical studies. There is no information on hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of Flublok or standard-dose flu vaccines, nor any immunogenicity metrics. Therefore, it does not address the claim regarding HA content or its relation to immunogenicity. Note: The image is clear enough to see that only adverse event rates are presented; no antigen content or immunogenicity data are visible.",
