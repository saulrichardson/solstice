  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of percentages reporting adverse events (Any, Moderate, Severe) across vaccine study groups, with footnotes describing study numbers, reporting thresholds, and trial registration details. does not support the claim because the table only shows safety/adverse event percentages and contains no information on HA antigen content or immunogenicity. Note: The image is clear but only presents safety data, with no antigen content or immunogenicity measurements visible.",
