  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing percentages of subjects reporting solicited systemic adverse events by severity (any, moderate, severe) across multiple studies, with footnotes describing study populations and reporting conventions. The table displays safety/reactogenicity data (percentages of adverse events) and does not present any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Portions of the image are cut off, but no antigen content or immunogenicity data appear visible.",
