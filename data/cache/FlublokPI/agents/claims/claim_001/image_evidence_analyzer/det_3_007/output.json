  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing PCR-confirmed influenza attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) comparing Flublok with a standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent), including columns for number of cases (n/N), attack rate percentage, relative risk (RR), and rVE (%) with 95% confidence intervals; footnotes define PCR, comparator, N, RR, and rVE. The table provides clinical efficacy data (attack rates, RR, and rVE) for Flublok versus a standard-dose vaccine but does not present any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity measures; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Image shows efficacy outcomes only; no content on HA antigen dosage or immunogenicity endpoints is visible.",
