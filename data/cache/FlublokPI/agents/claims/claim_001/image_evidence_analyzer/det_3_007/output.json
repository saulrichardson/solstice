  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing influenza attack rates, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) between Flublok and a U.S.-licensed quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent). does not support the claim because the image presents clinical efficacy outcomes (attack rates and relative efficacy) and contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or dosage. Note: Image shows only efficacy data; antigen content details are not visible in this figure.",
