  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table reporting influenza attack rates (n/N and %), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE with 95% CI) for Flublok versus a standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine comparator (Fluarix) against various influenza strains. The table presents clinical outcomes (attack rates, RR, and rVE) comparing Flublok to a standard-dose vaccine but contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or dosing. While it shows higher efficacy of Flublok, it does not document that Flublok contains three times the HA antigen of standard-dose vaccines, nor does it link any antigen content measurements to immunogenicity in this figure. Note: The image is clear and legible; however, no antigen\u2010dose data are provided in the visible content.",
