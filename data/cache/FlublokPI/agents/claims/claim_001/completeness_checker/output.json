The wording and numbers are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, line breaks, and punctuation). All key facts and numbers are present and match.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, or 45 mcg HA per strain, which is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines (a well-established standard not contradicted in this document). However, the quote does NOT address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim (antigen content) but does not provide evidence for the immunogenicity comparison.",
