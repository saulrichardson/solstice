For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",

      "explanation": "The quote appears in the '11 DESCRIPTION' section of the document. The text states: 'Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile, clear, color less injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. ... For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' This matches the quote to be verified, with only minor formatting differences and no substantive change in meaning or data.. The quote provides explicit information about the hemagglutinin (HA) content of Flublok: 135 mcg per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg per strain for three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines (a fact commonly known and implied by the comparison in the claim). While the quote does not directly mention 'greater immunogenicity,' it does provide the factual basis for the first part of the claim (the 3x HA content), which is the key technical assertion. The document also references studies comparing immunogenicity elsewhere, but the quote itself is sufficient to support the claim about antigen content.",
