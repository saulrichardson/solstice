For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",

      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in section 11 DESCRIPTION: 'Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile, clear, color less injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. ... For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' The wording and numbers are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA per strain for three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines (a fact that is widely recognized in the field, though not stated in this document). The quote provides the factual basis for the first part of the claim (3x the HA content). However, the quote does not address immunogenicity or its comparison to standard-dose vaccines. Thus, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim (antigen content), but not the second part (immunogenicity). Since the instructions allow support if the quote provides specific facts/numbers that substantiate the claim, and the claim is about antigen content being 3x higher, the quote is considered to support the claim as far as the document allows.",
