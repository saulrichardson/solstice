The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by specifying that Flublok contains 135 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA for each of three strains. Standard-dose flu vaccines typically contain 15 mcg HA per strain (total 45 mcg per dose), so this is three times the standard amount. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity, but it does fully substantiate the claim about HA content.",
