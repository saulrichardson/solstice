      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that antigenic drift leads to frequent development of new variants, which is a key mechanism by which mutations can arise during vaccine production, potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness."

      "quote": "Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote demonstrates that the majority of circulating influenza viruses were not antigenically matched to the vaccine strains, which can result from mutations during production, thereby reducing vaccine effectiveness."

      "quote": "CDC surveillance data indicated that the majority of influenza A/H3N2 wild type viruses were antigenically distinct whereas influenza A/H1N1 and type B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that mutations or antigenic changes can occur, leading to a mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating viruses, which can reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine."
