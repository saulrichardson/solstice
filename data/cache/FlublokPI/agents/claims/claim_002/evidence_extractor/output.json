      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that antigenic drift leads to the frequent development of new variants, which is a key mechanism by which mutations can arise during the production of flu vaccines, potentially reducing their effectiveness if the vaccine strains do not match circulating viruses."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that the vaccine strains can differ from circulating strains due to mutations or antigenic drift, which can reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine."
