      "quote": "Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year's influenza vaccine.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that antigenic variants can develop frequently, which is relevant because such changes (mutations) during vaccine production\u2014especially in cell- or egg-based systems\u2014can result in the vaccine being less effective if the produced antigens differ from circulating strains.",
