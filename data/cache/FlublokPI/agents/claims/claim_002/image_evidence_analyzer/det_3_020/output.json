  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010row, multi\u2010column table showing rates of CDC-defined influenza-like illness (ILI) and culture-confirmed influenza for various endpoints (all strains, matched strains, subtypes A and B) in vaccinated versus placebo groups, with calculated vaccine efficacy percentages and 95% confidence intervals. Footnotes describe study populations, case definitions, and analytic methods; references are listed at the bottom. The table presents clinical efficacy data for a recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (Flublok) versus placebo, reporting ILI and laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza rates and corresponding vaccine efficacy. There is no information about mutations arising during vaccine production in eggs or cell culture, nor about the comparative impact of such mutations on effectiveness. Therefore, the image does not address the claim. Note: The image is of sufficient clarity to read the efficacy data, but it does not contain any discussion or data on production-related viral mutations.",
