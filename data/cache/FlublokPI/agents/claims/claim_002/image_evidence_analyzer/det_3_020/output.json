  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine efficacy data from a clinical trial (Study 1, NCT00539981) comparing Flublok quadrivalent vaccine to placebo. It shows the number of cases, attack rates, relative risks, percent efficacy, and 95% confidence intervals for PCR-confirmed influenza with vaccine-matched strains and for any influenza strain, further broken down by influenza A and B subtypes. The table provides efficacy outcomes for Flublok quadrivalent versus placebo and does not contain any information about cell- or egg-based vaccine production methods or the development of mutations during manufacturing. Therefore, it does not support the claim.",
