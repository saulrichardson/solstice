  "explanation": "A table summarizing vaccine efficacy results from a clinical trial of Flublok Quadrivalent, showing numbers of culture-confirmed influenza-like illness cases, incidence rates per 1,000 participants, calculated vaccine efficacy percentages with 95% confidence intervals for all matched strains, subtypes A and B, and all strains regardless of match, along with footnotes and references. The figure presents efficacy data for a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok) but contains no information on cell- or egg-based vaccine production methods or on mutations arising during manufacturing, and therefore does not support the claim.",
