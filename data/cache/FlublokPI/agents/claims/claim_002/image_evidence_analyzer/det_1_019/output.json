The table presents safety/reactogenicity data (percentages of adverse events by severity) for vaccine study participants. It does not address manufacturing methods, viral mutations during production, or vaccine effectiveness. Note: The visible portion of the table only includes adverse event data and footnotes; no information on production methods or antigenic changes is present.",
