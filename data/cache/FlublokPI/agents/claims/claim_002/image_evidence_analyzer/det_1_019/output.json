  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting percentages of solicited systemic adverse events (e.g., headache, fatigue) reported by subjects in multiple vaccine studies, broken down by severity (any, moderate, severe) with footnotes on data collection and study design. The table only shows safety/reactogenicity data and does not mention production methods, mutations, or vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear but limited to adverse event data; no information on viral mutations or antigenic changes is provided.",
