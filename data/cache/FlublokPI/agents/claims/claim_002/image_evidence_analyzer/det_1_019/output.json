  "explanation": "A table presenting percentages of subjects reporting solicited local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, headache, fatigue) by severity category (<1% to 37%) for different study arms, with footnotes defining severity and study populations. does not support the claim: the table only reports adverse event frequencies and severity after vaccination and provides no information on vaccine production, mutations during manufacturing, or effects on vaccine effectiveness.
