  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A table comparing seasonal influenza vaccine production platforms (egg-based, cell-based, recombinant) across production timeline, advantages, and disadvantages. Evidence: Egg-based vaccines list \u201cPotential for egg-adapted changes\u201d as a disadvantage; cell-based vaccines list \u201cNo egg-adapted changes\u201d as an advantage, with no mention of cell-based mutations. does not support the claim because the table only notes egg-based vaccines can undergo egg-adapted changes and explicitly states cell-based vaccines have no egg-adapted changes, providing no evidence that cell-based production leads to mutations that reduce effectiveness. Note: Limited to information visible in the table; context beyond the displayed text is not available.",
