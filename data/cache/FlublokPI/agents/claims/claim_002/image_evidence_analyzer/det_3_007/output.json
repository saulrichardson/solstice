  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting attack rates (n/N and percentage), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE with 95% CI) for different influenza strains comparing two vaccine groups (presumably cell-based versus egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccines). The figure provides comparative clinical effectiveness data but does not present any information on the occurrence of mutations during vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness; it therefore does not support the claim. Note: Headers and vaccine group labels are partially obscured, limiting precise interpretation of comparator groups but not affecting the absence of mutation data.",
