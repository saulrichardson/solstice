  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing attack rates, sample sizes (n/N), relative risks (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE with 95% CI) between a cell-based influenza vaccine and a U.S.-licensed egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent). Four rows of data show differing attack rates and rVE figures for different influenza strains or endpoints. The table presents clinical outcome data (attack rates, RR, rVE) comparing a cell-based vaccine to an egg-based comparator. It does not mention the manufacturing processes, vaccine virus mutations, or any mechanistic explanation linking production-induced mutations to reduced effectiveness. Therefore, it does not provide evidence that cell- or egg-based vaccines develop mutations during production that affect efficacy. Note: Analysis is based solely on the visible table, which appears complete for efficacy data but contains no description of mutation occurrence or its impact on vaccine performance.",
