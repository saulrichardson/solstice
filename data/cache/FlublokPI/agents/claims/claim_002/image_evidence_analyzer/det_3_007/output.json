  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A table showing attack rates (n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE %) with 95% confidence intervals for cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine versus an egg-based comparator across various outcomes (culture-confirmed influenza, influenza A, influenza A/H1N1, influenza A/H3N2, influenza B). The table presents comparative effectiveness data between cell-based and egg-based vaccines but does not mention or demonstrate mutations arising during production or link reduced effectiveness to such mutations, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear but provides only efficacy comparison data without mechanistic information on production-related mutations.",
