  "explanation": "A screenshot of the first page of Flublok full prescribing information showing the table of contents with section headings (e.g., Indications and Usage, Dosage and Administration, Warnings and Precautions including Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness, Adverse Reactions, Clinical Studies, etc.). The table of contents lists general sections but contains no information about cell- or egg-based vaccine production, mutations during manufacturing, or their impact on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: Content is limited to section headings; no detailed text on production methods or mutation-related effectiveness limitations is shown.",
