  "explanation": "A screenshot of the table of contents and part of the prescribing information for Flublok, listing sections such as Indications and Usage, Dosage and Administration, Dosage Forms and Strengths, Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions (including Managing Allergic Reactions, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, Altered Immunocompetence, Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness, Syncope), Adverse Reactions, Use in Specific Populations, Description, Clinical Pharmacology, Nonclinical Toxicology, Clinical Studies, References, How Supplied/Storage and Handling, and Patient Counseling Information. The image shows only the structure and section headings of the Flublok prescribing information. It does not include any data or statements about cell- or egg-based vaccine production processes, the emergence of mutations during production, or their impact on vaccine effectiveness. There is a general section on 'Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness,' but no details in the visible text referencing mutations in cell- or egg-based production. Note: The image is clear and legible, and this is the initial page/table of contents of the document. No relevant supporting evidence is present in the visible content.",
