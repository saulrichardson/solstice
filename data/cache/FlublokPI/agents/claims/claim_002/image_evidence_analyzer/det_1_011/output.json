  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two adjacent tables summarizing solicited local and systemic adverse events (reactogenicity) reported in clinical trials of an influenza vaccine (Flublok) versus comparator/placebo cohorts, with percentages for events such as pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, and fever, along with footnotes on data collection and definitions. The image shows safety/reactogenicity data and does not include any information on vaccine production methods or mutations arising during production, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image is a partial extract focusing on adverse event rates; no production or mutation data are present.",
