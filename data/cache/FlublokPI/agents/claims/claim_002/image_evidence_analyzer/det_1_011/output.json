  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular summary of solicited local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) reported in clinical trials of the Flublok influenza vaccine versus comparators, with percentages of subjects experiencing each event and footnotes defining severity grades, trial registries, and denominators. The table presents safety and reactogenicity data (local and systemic adverse events) from clinical trials of the Flublok vaccine compared to other influenza vaccines. There is no information on vaccine production methods, mutation rates during production, egg- or cell-based manufacturing, or any impact of mutations on vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, the table does not address the claim about mutations arising during production and their potential to reduce vaccine effectiveness. Note: The image appears to be a complete table of adverse event data with clear footnotes. No sections related to production methods or efficacy are visible. If other pages contain production details, they are not included here.",
