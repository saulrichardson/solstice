  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial table showing percentages of reported adverse or severe responses (e.g., fever, other symptoms) in subjects receiving study vaccines in clinical Studies 3 and 4, with footnotes defining severity categories and noting registration of studies. The table presents safety and adverse event rates for different vaccine groups but contains no information about mutations arising during egg- or cell-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear for safety data but does not address production mutations; no relevant data were seen.",
