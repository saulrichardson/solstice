  "explanation": "A partial table listing the percentage of subjects reporting severe responses (<1% to 6%), footnotes defining severity grades, descriptions of Studies 3 and 4 (U.S.-licensed IIV3 vaccines, clinical trial registration), and temperature thresholds for mild and moderate fever. does not support the claim because the table and footnotes present safety and severity data from clinical trials, with no information on vaccine production methods or mutation development.
