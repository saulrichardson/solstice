  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A portion of a clinical trial table showing percentages of solicited adverse reactions (by severity: mild, moderate, severe) reported by subjects across multiple vaccine studies. Footnotes define reporting thresholds (e.g., \u22651% or <1%) and reference U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) studies. The table presents safety data (incidence of adverse reactions) for various influenza vaccines. It does not include any information on the vaccine production methods (cell-based vs. egg-based), genetic mutations arising during production, or measures of antigenic match or effectiveness. Therefore, it neither demonstrates nor relates to the claim that cell- or egg-based vaccines can acquire mutations during manufacturing that reduce effectiveness. Note: The visible portion appears clear and focused on safety outcomes; no relevant data on production methods or viral mutations is present.",
