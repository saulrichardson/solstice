  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial clinical table presenting percentages of subjects reporting solicited adverse events (all values <1%), followed by footnotes defining results (\u22651% reported, <1% labeled as <1%), subject population, severity definitions, and footnote 4 stating that in Studies 3 and 4 the U.S.-licensed IIV3 and IIV4 comparators were Fluzone High-Dose and Fluarix, respectively. Evidence: Footnote 4 indicates Fluarix was the IIV4 comparator in Study 4. The image does not support the claim because, while it shows that Fluarix was used as an IIV4 comparator in Study 4, it does not explicitly demonstrate that Flublok quadrivalent was evaluated against Fluarix quadrivalent in the pivotal trial, so it doesn't support the claim. Note: Table snippet is partial and lacks explicit mention of Flublok quadrivalent trial details.",
