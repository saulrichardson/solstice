  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two tables of solicited adverse events reporting local and systemic reactions. The left table compares Flublok versus placebo in Study 1 (NCT00539981) with percentages for fatigue, headache, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, shivers/chills, and fever. The right table shows pooled data comparing Flublok to a U.S.-licensed IIV comparator (Fluzone) with percentages for pain, redness, firmness/swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, and fever. Evidence: No mention of Fluarix (quadrivalent) or a quadrivalent standard-dose comparator; the only vaccines listed are placebo and Fluzone. does not support the claim because the tables only show comparisons of Flublok with placebo and Fluzone, with no evidence of an evaluation against Fluarix (quadrivalent).",
