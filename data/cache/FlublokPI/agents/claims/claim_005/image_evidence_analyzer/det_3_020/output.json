  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-row table showing vaccine efficacy data for Study 1 (NCT00539981) comparing Flublok/quadrivalent versus placebo. Columns include number of cases, attack rates, relative risk, vaccine efficacy percentages with 95% CI for various endpoints (culture-confirmed influenza-like illness, CDC-ILI, by strain). Footnotes and references are shown alongside. The table presents efficacy outcomes for Flublok compared with placebo in Study 1 and does not include any direct comparison with Fluarix (licensed quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), so it does not support the claim. Note: The visible figure pertains only to Study 1 against placebo; no head-to-head data against Fluarix are shown.",
