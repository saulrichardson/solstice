  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A table showing attack rates and relative risks (RR) for PCR-confirmed influenza cases, comparing an IIV4 vaccine group (n/N, % attack rate) against a comparator group. Footnotes define RR, rVE, and identify the comparator as U.S.-licensed standard-dose influenza vaccine, Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by GSK. Evidence: Footnote stating Comparator = U.S.-licensed standard-dose influenza vaccine, Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by GSK, alongside data for IIV4 (quadrivalent) vaccine group. The image shows that in the pivotal trial the IIV4 (quadrivalent) vaccine was evaluated against Fluarix Quadrivalent, which supports the claim. Note: The table header is partially cut off and the brand name \u2018Flublok\u2019 is not explicitly visible, but IIV4 in context refers to the quadrivalent Flublok vaccine.",
