The safety analysis population included 998 recipients of Flublok Quadrivalent and 332 Comparator vaccine recipients.",
      "explanation": "A very similar quote appears on page 3: 'Study 7 (NCT02290509) enrolled subjects 18 through 49 years of age randomized to receive Flublok Quadrivalent or a Comparator inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluarix\u00ae Quadrivalent, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline). The safety analysis population included 998 recipients of Flublok Quadrivalent and 332 Comparator vaccine recipients.' The wording and content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and spacing differences.. The quote directly states that Study 7 enrolled subjects 18-49 years old who were randomized to receive either Flublok Quadrivalent or Fluarix Quadrivalent (a standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine). This directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine)."

The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing, capitalization, and punctuation.. The quote directly states that Study 6 (the pivotal trial) enrolled subjects 50 years and older and randomized them to receive either Flublok Quadrivalent or Fluarix Quadrivalent (the standard-dose comparator). This directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine)."

      "quote": "The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 \u2013 [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears almost verbatim on page 4: 'The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 \u2013 [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5).' The only minor difference is the formatting of 'Quadrivalent' and spacing, but the content is the same.. The quote directly describes Study 6, which evaluated Flublok Quadrivalent against a 'Comparator.' Elsewhere in the document (page 3), it is specified that the Comparator in Study 6 is Fluarix Quadrivalent (manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline), a standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine)."
