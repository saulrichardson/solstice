      "explanation": "A very similar version of the quote appears on page 3: 'Study 6 (NCT02285998) enrolled subjects 50 years of age and older, randomized to ece ive Flublok Quad rival ent or Comparator (Fluarix Quad rival ent, manufactured by Glaxo smith kline) as an active control [see Clinical Studies (14 1. The safety analysis opu lati on included 4328 Flublok Quad rival ent recipients and 4344 Comparator vaccine eci pie nts.' The wording and numbers match the quote to verify, with only minor spacing and typographical differences due to OCR or formatting.. The quote directly states that Study 6 randomized subjects to receive either Flublok Quadrivalent or Fluarix Quadrivalent (manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline) as an active control. This confirms that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), thus directly supporting the claim."

The safety analysis population included 998 recipients of Flublok Quad rival ent and 332 Comparator vaccine recipients.' The wording and numbers match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and spacing differences.. The quote directly states that Study 7 enrolled subjects who were randomized to receive either Flublok Quadrivalent or Fluarix Quadrivalent (the comparator), and provides the number of recipients in each group. This directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine)."

The wording and abbreviations match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting and spacing differences.. The quote directly states that the comparator in Study 6 was 'U.S.-licensed quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, Fluarix quadrivalent, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.' This confirms that Flublok quadrivalent was evaluated in a pivotal trial (Study 6, NCT02285998) against Fluarix quadrivalent, which is a standard-dose vaccine. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim."
