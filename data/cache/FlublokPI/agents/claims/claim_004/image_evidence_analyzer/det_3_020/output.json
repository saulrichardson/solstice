  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing clinical outcomes of a high-dose recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (FluBlok) versus a licensed egg-based standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. The table lists numbers of CDC-defined influenza-like illness (ILI) and culture-confirmed cases, attack rates per 1,000, calculated vaccine efficacy percentages with 95% confidence intervals, broken down by all strains, subtype A, and subtype B. does not support the claim because the image provides clinical efficacy data (attack rates and percent efficacy) rather than any measurements of antibody titers or immunogenicity responses. Note: Table is clear and legible, but no immunogenicity or antibody response data are presented; conclusions are limited to clinical efficacy endpoints.",
