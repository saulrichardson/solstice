  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting percentages of solicited adverse events (mild, moderate, severe) reported by subjects in different vaccine groups, with most values <1% to single\u2010digit percentages, followed by footnotes explaining severity grading and study logistics. does not support the claim because the table shows safety/reactogenicity data and contains no immunogenicity or antibody response results comparing higher\u2010dose recombinant flu vaccine versus egg\u2010based standard\u2010dose vaccines. Note: Table headings and column labels are partially cut off and text quality is limited, but visible content pertains only to adverse event rates, not antibody titers.",
