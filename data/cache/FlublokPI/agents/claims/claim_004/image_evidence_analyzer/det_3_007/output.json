  "explanation": "A table showing attack rates (n/N and percentages), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI) for different influenza strains comparing a recombinant influenza vaccine to an egg-based standard-dose vaccine The table presents clinical attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy but does not show data on antibody titers or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim that higher-dose recombinant vaccine induces a more robust antibody response Note: The image quality is sufficient to read the table; however, no immunogenicity or antibody response data are presented",
