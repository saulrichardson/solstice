  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-part table showing solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse event rates (%) in vaccinated cohorts, along with footnotes describing study design, denominators, severity grading, and trial registration. does not support the claim because the table presents reactogenicity (safety/tolerability) data rather than immunogenicity or antibody response comparisons between higher-dose recombinant and egg-based standard-dose vaccines, and thus provides no evidence on antibody responses. Note: Image only shows adverse event data; no antibody titer or immunogenicity information is provided.",
