      "relevance_explanation": "This quote specifies that Flublok contains 45mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain, which is a higher dose than standard egg-based influenza vaccines (which typically contain 15mcg HA per strain). This higher dose is relevant to the claim that a higher-dose recombinant vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response.",

      "relevance_explanation": "This reference is to a published study that directly compares the immunogenicity (antibody response) of recombinant influenza hemagglutinin (rHA, i.e., Flublok) and standard trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIVs) in older adults. The inclusion of this reference in the clinical studies section supports the claim that the recombinant vaccine's antibody response has been compared to that of standard egg-based vaccines, and the cited study is known to show higher antibody responses with the recombinant vaccine.",
