      "quote": "Data from a randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that children 6 months to less than 3 years of age had diminished hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) responses to Flublok compared to a U.S.-licensed influenza vaccine approved for use in this population, strongly suggesting that Flublok would not be effective in children younger than 3 years of age (6).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote demonstrates that antibody responses (measured by HI) can differ between Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) and standard egg-based vaccines, supporting the idea that vaccine formulation and dose can affect antibody response."

      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers.",

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that Flublok is a higher-dose vaccine (135 mcg total HA per dose), which is relevant to the claim that higher-dose recombinant vaccines may induce a more robust antibody response compared to standard-dose vaccines."
