      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains... Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that Flublok is a recombinant vaccine with a higher total hemagglutinin (HA) content (135 mcg per dose) compared to standard egg-based vaccines, which is a key factor in potentially inducing a more robust antibody response."
