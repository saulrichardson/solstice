These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) anti bod",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that Flublok (a recombinant flu vaccine) is designed to induce a humoral (antibody) immune response, which is the basis for comparing antibody responses between vaccines."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that Flublok is a higher-dose recombinant vaccine (135 mcg HA per dose) and is not egg-based, directly supporting the claim's comparison."

S.-licensedinfluenza vaccine approved for usein this population, strongly suggesting that Flublok would not be effective in children younger than3 years of age (6).",
