      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant Ha proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) anti bod",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes that Flublok (a recombinant flu vaccine) induces a humoral immune response, which is measured by antibody levels (HI antibodies), directly relating to the claim about antibody response."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that Flublok is a higher-dose recombinant vaccine (135 mcg HA per dose), supporting the claim that it is a higher-dose alternative to standard egg-based vaccines."
