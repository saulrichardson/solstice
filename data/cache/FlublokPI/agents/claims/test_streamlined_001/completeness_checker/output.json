    "analysis": " The existing evidence fully supports the part of the claim regarding Flublok containing 45 mcg of HA per strain (for a total of 135 mcg per 0.5 mL dose for three strains). However, it does not provide direct evidence about the HA content per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine (15 mcg per strain), nor does it explicitly compare the two. To fully support the claim, evidence confirming the HA content in standard-dose vaccines is needed, ideally from the same document or a reliable comparative source. Searching for sections that discuss standard-dose vaccine formulations or comparative tables would be the next step."
