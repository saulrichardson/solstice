The wording and order are nearly identical, with only minor differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote directly supports the claim. It shows that the study compared individuals vaccinated with RIV4 (Flublok) and those vaccinated with SD-IIV4 (which, as defined in the document, includes Fluarix among other standard-dose quadrivalent vaccines). The document explicitly lists Fluarix as one of the SD-IIV4 vaccines.
