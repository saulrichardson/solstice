      "explanation": "A very similar quote appears in the document: 'Influenza vaccines were ident i fied through the EMR; SD-IIV4 included Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, Standard Dose Flu zone and FlucelVax HD-IIV4 was High Dose Flu zone, RIV4 was Flublok and Adj-IV was FluAd.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and spacing.. The quote directly identifies Flublok as RIV4 and Fluarix as one of the SD-IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent) vaccines. Since the study compares RIV4 (Flublok) to SD-IIV4 (which includes Fluarix), this confirms that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), thus supporting the claim.",

The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, hyphenation).. The quote directly states that the primary exposure of interest in the study was vaccine type, specifically listing recombinant (RIV4/Flublok) and SD-IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent vaccines, which includes Fluarix). The document further clarifies that SD-IIV4 included Fluarix among other vaccines. This supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), as both vaccines were included in the main comparison groups of the study.",
