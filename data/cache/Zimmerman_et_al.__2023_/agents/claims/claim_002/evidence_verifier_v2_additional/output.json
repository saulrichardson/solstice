The quote directly states that egg-based vaccines are subject to mutations at the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site, and that these mutations reduce their effectiveness. This directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote specifically addresses the risk of mutation in egg-based vaccines and its impact on effectiveness.",
