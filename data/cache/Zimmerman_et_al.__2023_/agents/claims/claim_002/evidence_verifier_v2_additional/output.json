The wording matches the provided quote, and the factual content is preserved.. The quote directly states that egg-based vaccines are subject to mutations at the A (H3N2) glycosylation binding site, and that these mutations reduce their effectiveness. This explicitly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness, at least for egg-based vaccines. The quote does not mention cell-based vaccines, but it does substantiate the risk of mutation and reduced effectiveness in egg-based vaccine production as claimed.",
