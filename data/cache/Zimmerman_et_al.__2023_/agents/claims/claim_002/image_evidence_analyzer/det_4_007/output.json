  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine effectiveness (VE) percentages with 95% confidence intervals for different influenza vaccines\u2014recombinant quadrivalent vaccine (RIV4), standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent vaccine (SD-IIV4), and RIV4 plus high-dose egg-based HD-IIV4 plus adjuvanted vaccine (Adj-IV)\u2014compared to no vaccination, stratified by age group (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years) and subgroup (overall, males, females). The table reports VE data for various influenza vaccines but does not mention or link mutations arising during cell- or egg-based production to reduced effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: No direct information on vaccine production methods or mutation occurrences is provided in the table; the image quality is sufficient to confirm absence of mutation data.",
