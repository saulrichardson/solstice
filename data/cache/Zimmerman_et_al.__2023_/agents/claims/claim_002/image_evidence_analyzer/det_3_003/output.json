  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table and accompanying text presenting comparative vaccine effectiveness (VE) data for recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus standard-dose and enhanced inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4, Adj-IV). It includes VE percentages, 95% confidence intervals, and subgroup analyses by age, sex, and risk conditions. The table presents clinical effectiveness data comparing different influenza vaccines but doesn't discuss the potential for mutations during egg- or cell-based production, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image is partially cropped; however, no content about production-related mutations is visible.",
