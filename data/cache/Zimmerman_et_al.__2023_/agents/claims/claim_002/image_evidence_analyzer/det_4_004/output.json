  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine effectiveness (percentages with 95% confidence intervals) comparing recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4: Flublok) against standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIV4: Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, SD Fluzone, FluCelVax) across various subgroups (overall, by sex, age groups, high-risk condition) and influenza seasons (2018\u20132019, 2019\u20132020). The effectiveness estimates are shown unadjusted and adjusted using a priori variables, propensity score, and inverse probability weighting (IPW). The table provides comparative effectiveness estimates of different influenza vaccines but contains no data or mention of mutations arising during egg- or cell-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Text is clear and complete for effectiveness estimates; no mutation-related information is present.",
