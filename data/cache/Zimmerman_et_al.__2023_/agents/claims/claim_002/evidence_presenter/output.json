      "explanation": "The quote 'because it is not subject to mutations to the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site that reduce the effectiveness of egg based vaccines.' appears on page 6 of the document. The wording matches exactly, with no significant differences.. The quote directly states that egg-based vaccines can develop mutations at the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site, which reduce their effectiveness. This supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness, specifically referencing the mutation risk in egg-based vaccines."

      "explanation": "The quote 'because it is not subject to mutations to the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site that reduce the effectiveness of egg based vaccines.' appears on page 6 of the document, with only minor differences in punctuation and spacing from the quote to verify.. The quote directly states that egg-based vaccines are subject to mutations at the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site, and that these mutations reduce their effectiveness. This directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote specifically addresses the risk of mutation in egg-based vaccines and its impact on effectiveness."
