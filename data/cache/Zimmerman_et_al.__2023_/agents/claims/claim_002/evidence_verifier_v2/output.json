The wording is a direct match, and the factual content is preserved.. The quote explicitly states that egg-based vaccines can develop mutations at the A (H3N2) glycosylation binding site, and that these mutations reduce the effectiveness of the vaccines. This directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote is specific about the type of mutation (at the glycosylation binding site) and its impact (reduced effectiveness), thus providing clear support for the claim.",
