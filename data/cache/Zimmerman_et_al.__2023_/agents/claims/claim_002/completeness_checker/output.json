The wording matches exactly, with no significant differences.. The quote directly states that egg-based vaccines can develop mutations at the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site, which reduce their effectiveness. This supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness, specifically referencing the mutation risk in egg-based vaccines.",
