      "relevance_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by stating that recombinant HA antigens (as used in RIV4) are not affected by mutations that occur during egg-based vaccine production, which can reduce the effectiveness of egg-derived vaccines. This implies a mechanistic advantage for recombinant vaccines in targeting conserved regions."
