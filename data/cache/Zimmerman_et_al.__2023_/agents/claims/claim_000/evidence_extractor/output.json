      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by stating that Flublok (RIV4) is not subject to mutations that occur in egg-based vaccines, which can alter the antigenic match to WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. This implies that Flublok maintains the intended antigenic match."
