  "explanation": "A flowchart showing the numbers of participants in primary analyses: boxes labeled RIV4 n=3,047; SD-IIV4 n=862; Unvaccinated n=8,878, and a subcohort with RIV4 n=291; SD-IIV4 n=114; Unvaccinated n=1,398. The image only presents participant group sizes and study flow; it does not provide any information about antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Image appears complete for the flowchart; no relevant antigenic or strain-selection data are present.",
