  "explanation": "A partial page of a clinical document showing a legend defining vaccine abbreviations (RIV4: Flublok; SD-IIV4: various egg-based vaccines) and text discussing comparative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) for different influenza vaccines in adults. The image only presents vaccine abbreviations and comparative effectiveness data; it does not address antigenic composition or affirm that Flublok matches WHO- and FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim.
