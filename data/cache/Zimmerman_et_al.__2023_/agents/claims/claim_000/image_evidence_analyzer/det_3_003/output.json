  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A text snippet from page 4 including footnotes defining vaccine groups (RIV4: Flublok; SD-IIV4: standard-dose vaccines) and a paragraph describing relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 in different age and risk subgroups, with rVE percentages and 95% confidence intervals. The content presents vaccine effectiveness data for Flublok compared with standard-dose vaccines and does not address antigenic matching with WHO- or FDA-selected strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image is a partial excerpt and no antigenic match information is included in the visible text.",
