  "explanation": "A table displaying vaccine effectiveness estimates (percent protection with 95% confidence intervals) for RIV4 (Flublok) compared with standard-dose egg-based influenza vaccines (SD-IIV4) overall, by sex, age group, risk status, and by 2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020 seasons. Adjustments include multivariable regression, propensity score, and inverse probability weighting. does not support the claim because the table provides effectiveness data and subgroup analyses but contains no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Note: The image is clear for VE data, but no antigenic match details are present.",
