  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table displaying relative vaccine effectiveness comparing Flublok (IIV4) to standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccines (SD-IIV4) by subgroup (overall, sex, age groups, risk condition status) and by season (2018\u20132019, 2019\u20132020). Columns show unadjusted and adjusted effectiveness estimates (using a priori variables, propensity scores, and inverse probability weighting) as percentages with 95% confidence intervals. Footnotes define IIV4, SD-IIV4, and statistical adjustment methods. The table reports comparative vaccine effectiveness data and contains no information on antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Text is small but legible; the table clearly focuses on effectiveness metrics and does not address antigenic matching.",
