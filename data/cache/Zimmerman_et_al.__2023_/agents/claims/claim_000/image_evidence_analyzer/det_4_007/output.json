  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine effectiveness (VE, %) with 95% confidence intervals for recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), and RIV4 combined with high-dose and adjuvanted vaccines, stratified by age group (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years) and sex. The table reports clinical effectiveness percentages and confidence intervals for different influenza vaccines; it contains no data on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but only covers VE outcomes and does not address antigenic match.",
