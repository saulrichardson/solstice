  "explanation": "A table labeled Table 4 presenting vaccine effectiveness (VE, % [95% CI]) of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), RIV4 + high dose IIV4 + adjuvanted IIV (Adj-IV), and SD-IIV4, compared to no vaccination, stratified by age groups (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years). VE values and confidence intervals are shown for overall populations and females. The table provides vaccine effectiveness data but contains no information on antigenic match or strain selection relative to WHO or FDA recommendations, so it does not support the claim.",
