  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the study cohort of adults \u226518 years (N=18,467), exclusions (n=3,264 for recent influenza, unknown vaccination status, immunocompromised), resulting in an analyzable cohort (N=15,203), divided into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868). Both groups are further categorized by vaccine type: recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), high-dose/adjuvanted IIV4, and unvaccinated, with corresponding sample sizes. The image provides only cohort selection and vaccine group counts; it does not support the claim about identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. Note: No data in the figure regarding antigenic match or strain selection; text is clear and fully visible.",
