  "explanation": "Flow diagram showing the derivation of the analyzable cohort from an initial study population, exclusions criteria (recent influenza, missing vaccination status, immunocompromised), and subsequent breakdown of controls and influenza cases by vaccine type (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4 + Adj-IIV, unvaccinated). The figure only presents participant numbers and cohort flow by vaccine type; it provides no data or statements about antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited to cohort flow information; no antigenic or regulatory matching data are visible.",
