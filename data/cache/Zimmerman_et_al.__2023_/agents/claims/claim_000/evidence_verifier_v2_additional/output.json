      "original_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by indicating that Flublok (RIV4) avoids the antigenic changes that can occur in egg-based vaccines, which can lead to a mismatch with the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. This implies that Flublok maintains an identical antigenic match to the selected strains."
