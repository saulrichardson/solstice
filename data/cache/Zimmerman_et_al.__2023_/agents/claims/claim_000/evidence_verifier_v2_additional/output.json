      "original_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by indicating that Flublok (RIV4) is not affected by mutations that occur during egg-based vaccine production, which can alter the antigenic match to WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. This implies that Flublok maintains the intended antigenic match."
