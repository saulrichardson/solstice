  "explanation": "A table displaying vaccine effectiveness (VE) percentages (with 95% confidence intervals) for different influenza vaccines\u2014recombinant quadrivalent (RIV4), standard-dose quadrivalent (SD-IIV4), RIV4 plus high-dose IIV4 and adjuvanted IIV (Adj-IV)\u2014stratified by age group (18\u201364 years, \u226565 years). The table reports vaccine effectiveness data and does not provide any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative HA doses, so it does not support the claim Note: The image is a partial table focused on clinical effectiveness and does not include antigen content data; interpretation is limited to visible content.",
