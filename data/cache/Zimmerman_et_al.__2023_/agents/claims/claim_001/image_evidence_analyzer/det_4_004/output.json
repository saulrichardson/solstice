  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of Flublok versus standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccines (Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, SD Fluzone, and Flucelvax) across subgroups (overall, by sex, age groups, risk conditions, and seasons) with unadjusted and adjusted (%) rVE estimates and 95% confidence intervals. The table presents comparative effectiveness percentages and confidence intervals, not antigen content or immunogenicity data, and therefore does not support the claim regarding 3\u00d7 HA antigen content of Flublok.",
