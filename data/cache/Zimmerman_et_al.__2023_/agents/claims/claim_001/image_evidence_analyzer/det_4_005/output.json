  "explanation": "A snippet of narrative text from a clinical document (page footer number 5138) discussing influenza-like illness (ILI) outcomes and a 2019 editorial by Flannery and Fry; no table or antigen content data is visible. does not support the claim because the visible content contains only narrative efficacy data and an editorial comment, with no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparisons between Flublok and standard-dose vaccines.
