  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flow diagram showing participant counts for primary analyses: Recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) n=3,047, standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) n=862, unvaccinated n=8,878, and a subgroup analysis: RIV4 n=291, SD-IIV4 n=114, unvaccinated n=1,398. The figure depicts only participant enrollment numbers by vaccine group and provides no data on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and fully legible; no relevant antigen content information is present.",
