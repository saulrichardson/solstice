Background: Relative effectiveness of various vaccine formulations provide important input for vaccine
policy decisions and provider purchasing decisions. We used electronic databases to conduct a test-
negative case control study to determine relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of recombinant inﬂuenza
vaccine (RIV4) compared with standard dose vaccines (SD-IIV4) against inﬂuenza hospitalization.
Methods: Adults 18–64 and 65 years of age hospitalized in a large U.S. health system (19 hospitals) in
2018–2019 and 2019–2020 who were clinically tested for inﬂuenza using reverse transcription poly-
merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were included. The hospital system electronic medical record
EMR) and the state immunization registry were used to conﬁrm inﬂuenza vaccination. Propensity scores
with inverse probability weighting were used to adjust for potential confounders and determine rVE.
Results: Of the 14,590 individuals included in the primary analysis, 3,338 were vaccinated with RIV4 and
976 were vaccinated with SD-IIV4, with the balance of 10,276 being unvaccinated. Most participants
were white (80 %), most (70 %) had a high-risk condition, just over half were female (54 %) and age
65 years or older (53 %). Overall RIV4 rVE was signiﬁcant when adjusted for propensity scores with
nverse probability weights (rVE = 31; 95 % CI = 11 %, 46 %). Among younger adults (18–64 years-old),
overall rVE of RIV4 was signiﬁcant (rVE = 29; 95 % CI = 4 %, 47 %).
Conclusions: Over all adults, both RIV4 and SD-IIV4 were effective against inﬂuenza hospitalization, with
RIV4 providing better protection compared with SD-IIV4 overall, for females, younger adults, and those
with no high-risk conditions.

and over, inﬂuenza remains a major cause of morbidity, hospital-
izations and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide. Over the last
1–2 decades, effectiveness of egg-based standard dose inﬂuenza
vaccine has been modest [1–5]. New inﬂuenza vaccine formula-
tions, designed to improve upon the effectiveness of these vacci-
nes, have been introduced in the U.S. over the past several years
including high dose- and adjuvanted egg-based vaccines. In addi-
tion, egg-free vaccines manufactured using cell-culture and recom-
binant
technologies
have
been
licensed
that
avoid
the
glycosylation site binding issues associated with egg adaptation
[6] that have been shown to reduce vaccine effectiveness (VE
against A(H3N2) strains.



==================== PAGE 2 ====================

Reasonably accurate VE and relative VE (rVE) estimates depend
upon having access to a sufﬁcient number of recipients of any
given vaccine type. Research on high dose quadrivalent inﬂuenza
vaccine (HD-IIV4) has reported rVE for HD-IIV4 compared with
standard dose quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) of 24 %
against laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza [7] and 27 % against inﬂu-
enza hospitalization [8]. Several studies of cell-cultured inﬂuenza
vaccine were conducted prior to the 2019–2020 season (when all
four vaccine strains were cell-cultured) and have not shown signif-
icant rVE against inﬂuenza illness compared with SD-IIV4 [9]. A
large retrospective study of Medicare beneﬁciaries (65 years of
age) in the 2019–2020 season demonstrated no signiﬁcant rVE of
cell-cultured quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (ccIIV4) compared
with SD-IIV4 against inﬂuenza-related hospital encounters [10].
However, the study was limited by the fact that there were no
laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza outcomes. Thus, the full beneﬁt
of cell-culture vaccine technology is still largely unknown.
Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadriva-
lent inﬂuenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneﬁciaries study
[10] using retrospective data as described above, reported signiﬁ-
cant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4) against inﬂuenza-related hospital
encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found
signiﬁcant
rVE
of
RIV4
compared
with
SD-IIV4
among
adults 50 years old, but not for adults 65 years old [11].
Given the higher cost of newer vaccines, and the high risk of
inﬂuenza complications for certain groups, including the elderly
[12], there is interest in providing the most effective vaccine to
the largest number of patients to prevent inﬂuenza-related mor-
bidity and mortality. Additional rVE studies of new vaccine formu-
lations are needed to help determine vaccination best practices.
This study is a retrospective test-negative case-control study of
inﬂuenza VE against hospitalization using data from electronic
medical records (EMR) of a single large health system to determine
the rVE of RIV4 among adults 18–64 and 65 years of age in the
2018–2019 and 2019–2020 seasons.


2. METHODS

The
University
of
Pittsburgh
Institutional
Review
Board
approved this retrospective study using EMR databases. A test-
negative case-control study estimates VE by comparing the odds
of vaccination among patients hospitalized with inﬂuenza like ill-
ness with conﬁrmed inﬂuenza to the odds of vaccination among
controls, i.e., patients hospitalized with inﬂuenza like illness who
tested negative for inﬂuenza.


2.1. PATIENTS

Patients were individuals 18 years and older as of August 1 each
season who were hospitalized in one of nineteen UPMC hospitals
in central and southwestern Pennsylvania and had a test for inﬂu-
enza at any time between 11/01/2018 and 04/30/2020. A Ther-
adoc database (an infection control software) was used to
identify those tested for inﬂuenza using reverse transcription poly-
merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays performed in a centralized
clinical lab for some hospitals and individual hospital labs for
others. Inﬂuenza cases were those who tested positive for inﬂu-
enza and controls were those who tested negative for inﬂuenza
regardless of any other identiﬁed viral infection. Both the EMR
and Pennsylvania Statewide Immunization Information System
(PA-SIIS) were queried for inﬂuenza vaccines given between
August 1 and the date of illness/PCR testing. Exclusion criteria were
testing within 2 weeks of vaccination, having 2 different types of
inﬂuenza vaccine in a season, missing and unknown vaccination
information and having an immunocompromising condition.


2.2. STATISTICAL METHODS

For primary analysis, all adults 18 years were included, then
for
secondary
analyses,
they
were
stratiﬁed
into
age
groups 65 years, and 18–64 years. Sample size calculations deter-
mined that we had 48 % power to detect an effect size of 9.5 %
change from a baseline probability of 11.7 %. Post hoc sample size
calculations for age subgroup analyses resulted in 42 % and 20 %
power for ages 18–64 years and 65 years with effect sizes of
8.9 %, and 8.7 %, with the detectable difference of 3 % and 2.1 %
respectively, thus these analyses were likely to be underpowered
to detect a signiﬁcant rVE for RIV4 over SD-IIV4. Moreover, rVE
estimates by vaccine strain were also precluded by insufﬁcient
sample sizes. Descriptions of variables for each group were sum-
marized as mean and standard deviation for age and frequencies
and percentages for categorical data. Baseline characteristics
between the vaccination groups were compared using chi-square
or the Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and ages were
compared by using t-test.
Using adjusted odds ratios (aORs) obtained from multivariable
logistic regression models, adjusted VE estimates were calculated
as (1-aOR) X 100. The dependent variable of interest was inﬂuenza
status. The primary exposure of interest was vaccine type (recom-
binant, SD-IIV4s and in some analyses, enhanced vaccines such as
HD-IIV4 and adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine (Adj-IV)). The CDC has
recommended the use of ‘‘enhanced vaccines” for adults ages 65
and older beginning in 2022 [13]. Inﬂuenza vaccines were identi-
ﬁed through the EMR; SD-IIV4 included Aﬂuria, Fluarix, FluLaval,
Standard Dose Fluzone and FlucelVax. HD-IIV4 was High Dose Flu-
zone, RIV4 was Flublok and Adj-IV was FluAd. Other independent
variables were age, inﬂuenza season (2018–2019 and 2019–
2020), sex, race and presence of one or more high-risk conditions.
Adjusted VE was calculated for RIV4, SD-IIV4 and combined RIV4,
high dose, egg-based and adjuvanted vaccines. Relative VE (rVE)
was calculated as 1 minus the ratio of adjusted VE times 100 %.
We conducted propensity adjustment analyses to reduce the
potential impact of selection effects (i.e., confounding) on baseline
characteristics. We estimated the propensity scores using the Gen-
eralized Boosted Regression Models (GBM) approach, which is a
nonparametric model that allows for nonlinear relationships with
a maximum number of iterations set to the default (i.e.,10,000)
that minimized the balance statistics of interest. We used the bal-
ance statistic based on absolute standardized bias (also referred as
the effect size or absolute standardized mean difference) and sum-
marized across variables. We allow a maximum of three splits for
each tree in the model, allowing for three-way interactions among
all covariates to be considered. The shrinkage parameter was set to
0.0005 to ensure a smooth ﬁt.
We also checked the balance of all the variables included in the
model to assess the quality of the propensity score and evaluate
common support, using a value under 0.25 as indicative of good
balance. We also used the balance plots to compare the propensity
score distributions and to evaluate the common support.
Using the propensity score, we calculated the inverse probabil-
ity of receiving SD-IIV4 weighting. In this approach, for an individ-
ual receiving SD-IIV4 t, the weight equals 1=ptðxÞ , where ptðxÞ is
the propensity score (probability that an individual with character-
istics x receives SD-IIV4 t). A propensity score weighted logistic
regression with inﬂuenza status as the dependent variable was ﬁt-
ted to estimate the effect of vaccine (SD-IIV4 vs. RIV4) on outcome
and also used inverse probability weighting to estimate VE and its
95 % conﬁdence intervals. We added covariates like high-risk con-
ditions and inﬂuenza seasons to increase the probability of achiev-
ing a good balance for the propensity score modeling. We used ﬁve
plot methods to determine that there were no extreme values in
the weights (i.e., checked the balance): 1. optimization using the

estimated mean average treatment effect; 2. box plot of the
propensity of the vaccine; 3. the standardized effect size of the
unweighted and weighted values; 4. t-test p-values of the group
mean of the covariate; and 5. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) p-
values of the covariates. In all, the weights were stable and bal-
anced. Because all the covariates were balanced, we ﬁt the model
with propensity score as an adjustment factor and the inverse
probability weight to estimate the rVE.
We conducted secondary, sensitivity analyses restricted to age
groups 18–64 years and 65 years comparing recombinant and
SD-IIV4, and also for those 65 years, comparing recombinant,
high-dose egg-based and adjuvanted vaccines combined and SD-
IIV4. We conducted propensity score adjustments similar to those
used in the primary analyses. All analyses were two-sided and the
alpha level was set to 0.05. All analyses were conducted using SAS,
version 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We
used the Toolkit for Weighting and Analysis of Nonequivalent
Groups (TWANG) software package and the SAS Macros (available
at https://www.rand.org/statistics/twang/downloads.html) to cal-


3. RESULTS

The total number of inﬂuenza test results among inpatients was
18,467 of which 530 were excluded because of missing vaccination
information or vaccination < 14 days before illness, and 3,264 were
excluded from the primary analyses because patients were
immunocompromised or received enhanced vaccines other than
RIV4 (n = 613), leaving 14,590 for the primary analysis (Fig. 1).
Of these, 3,338 were vaccinated with RIV4 and 976 were vacci-
nated with SD-IIV4, with the balance of 10,276 being unvaccinated.
For the secondary analyses, the analyzable cohort included the 613
HD-IIV4 and Adj-IV recipients bringing the total analyzable sample
to 15,203 (Fig. 2). The inﬂuenza positivity rate was 12.4 %
(1,803/14,590) overall, 14.4 % among younger adults 18–64 years
and 11.1 % (922/8306) among those 65 years, with the addition
of 613 patients who received enhanced vaccines that were not
included in the primary analysis.
Demographic characteristics of the population for the primary
analyses are shown in Table 1; most participants were white
(80 %), just over half were female (54 %) and age 65 years or older

[FIGURE 4 - See figure_p3_42089d8a.png]

Fig. 1. Flow chart for primary analyses. The primary analyses included only participants who received recombinant quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (RIV4), standard dose
quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) and the unvaccinated, who were not otherwise excluded.

(53 %), and most (70 %) had a high-risk condition. Patients who
received RIV4 were signiﬁcantly less often white (P < 0.001) and
age 65 years or older (P < 0.001), and had more high-risk condi-
tions (P < 0.001) than those who received SD-IIV4.

Table 2 shows adjusted VE for both RIV4 and SD-IIV4s and rVE
of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4s. VE of RIV4 was signiﬁcant against
inﬂuenza hospitalizations overall (36 %; 95 % CI = 27, 45) and for
population subgroups based on sex, age and risk conditions. VE
of SD-IIV4 was signiﬁcant overall (24 %; 95 % CI = 6, 38) and for
males and younger adults, but not for other subgroups. Overall
rVE for RIV4 vs SD-IIV4 against inﬂuenza hospitalization was sig-
niﬁcant when adjusted for propensity scores with inverse probabil-
ity weights (rVE = 31%; 95 % CI = 11, 46). Subgroup analyses by age
and risk group identiﬁed signiﬁcant rVE for recombinant inﬂuenza
vaccine among females (rVE = 37%; 95 % CI = 13, 54), younger
adults 18–64 years old (rVE = 28%; 95 % CI = 3, 46) and for those
without high-risk conditions (rVE = 60%; 95 % CI = 29, 78).
In secondary analyses, the participants, including those who
received HD-IIV4 and Adj-IV, were then divided in two age groups
(18–64 and 65 years) to calculate rVE. Characteristics of these
groups by vaccine type are shown in Table 3. Among younger
adults, receipt of RIV4 was signiﬁcantly associated with non-
white race (83.7 % RIV4 vs. 71.8 % SD-IIV4; P < 0.001), fewer cases
of inﬂuenza (9.2 % RIV4 vs. 11.9 % SD-IIV4; P < 0.041) and having a
high-risk condition (83.2 % RIV4 vs. 66.8 % SD-IIV4; P < 0.001).
Among older adults, receipt of RIV4 was signiﬁcantly associated
with having a high-risk condition (91.1 % RIV4 vs. 78.4 % SD-IIV4
P < 0.001). In a second scenario older adults receiving SD-IIV4 were
compared with those receiving RIV4, HD-IIV4, or Adj-IV , because
these latter two ‘‘enhanced” vaccines are now recommended for
adults 65 years. Again, having a high-risk condition was associ-
ated with receipt of one of these vaccines (87.5 % combined vs.
78.4 % SD-IIV4; P < 0.001).
Adjusted VEs for RIV4 for younger adults were signiﬁcant across
all subgroups, whereas, VE for SD-IIV4 was signiﬁcant for males
only. Among older adults, VE of RIV4 was signiﬁcant for females
(47 %; 95 % CI = 30, 60) but not males (2 %; 95 % CI = –33, 21)
or for those with and without high-risk conditions. VEs for
those 65 years old receiving RIV4, HD-IV4 or Adj-IV showed sim-
ilar patterns of signiﬁcance across subgroups (overall VE = 24 %;
95 % CI = 11, 36; females VE = 38 %; 95 % CI = 22, 51); high risk

otherwise excluded.

conditions VE = 22 %; 95 % CI = 6, 34; no high-risk condition
VE = 38 %; 95 % CI = 3, 61). VE of standard dose IIV4 was not signif-
icant for any group 65 years old (Table 4).
Table 5 shows the rVE in three scenarios: 1) for 18–64-year-old
adults, RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4; and for 65-year-old adults: 2) RIV4 vs.
SD-IIV4; and 3) RIV4 + HD-IIV4 +Adj-IV vs. SD-IIV4. Among
younger adults, overall rVE of RIV4 was signiﬁcant (rVE = 29 %;
95 % CI = 4, 47). Subgroup analyses identiﬁed signiﬁcant rVE for
RIV4 among males (rVE = 43 %; 95 % CI = 6, 65), and for those with-
out high-risk conditions (rVE = 51 %; 95 % CI = 7, 74). Among older
adults, neither rVE for RIV4 nor rVE for RIV4 + HDIV4 +Adj-IV was
signiﬁcant overall or for any subgroup.


4. DISCUSSION

Among over 14,000 mostly white, and mostly high-risk adult
patients hospitalized for an acute respiratory infection in 2018–
2019 and 2019–2020, 12 % were diagnosed with inﬂuenza. Com-
pared with standard dose inﬂuenza vaccine recipients, recipients
of so-called ‘‘enhanced” vaccines such as RIV4, Adj-IV and HD-
IIV4 were more often non-white, older, and with underlying med-

ical
conditions,
placing
them
at
high
risk
for
inﬂuenza
complications.
Among all adults hospitalized for acute respiratory infections,
both RIV4 and SD-IIV4 were signiﬁcantly effective overall against
inﬂuenza hospitalizations, but only RIV4 was effective for all sub-
groups tested in this analysis. The differences in VE of RIV4 and
SD-IIV4 were reﬂected in overall signiﬁcant rVE for RIV4. However,
within the overall population, rVE of RIV4 was signiﬁcant for
females, younger adults and those without high-risk conditions,
the latter two groups being those who were less likely to receive
RIV4. When stratiﬁed by age groups, rVE of RIV4 of younger adults
was signiﬁcant overall, among males and those without a high-risk
condition; whereas, among older adults, neither RIV4 nor all high
dose or adjuvanted vaccines combined was signiﬁcantly more
effective than standard dose IIV4. This was likely due to limited
use of the SD-IIV4 (only 213 seniors received SD-IIV4), resulting
in large conﬁdence intervals. The large market share in our
study of RIV4, HD-IIV4 and Adj-IV in senior adults, relative to
SD-IIV4 limited our analysis and seemingly anticipated the 2022
decision by ACIP to recommend these three vaccines for older
adults [13].

[TABLE 11 - See table_p5_d032edfd.png]

Only two other studies were identiﬁed that have compared VE
of RIV4 with SD-IIV4. In a RCT, Dunkle et al reported a signiﬁcant
rVE of 30 % among adults 50 years old against RT-PCR conﬁrmed
inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) but when stratiﬁed by age groups, rVE
was not signiﬁcant for those 65 years for either RT-PCR con-
ﬁrmed ILI nor culture positive ILI. For those 50–64 years, rVE was
signiﬁcant against RT-PCR ILI (42 %; 95 % CI = 15, 61) and against
culture positive ILI (44 %; 96 % CI = 10, 65) [11]. The other study
was a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneﬁciaries 65 years
of age and above in 2019–2020 by Izurieta et al. [10] that reported

signiﬁcant rVE of RIV4, HD-IIV3 and adjuvanted IIV3, respectively,
compared with SD-IIV4 against inﬂuenza-related hospital encoun-
ters. rVE of RIV4 was signiﬁcant compared with HD-IIV3 and cell
cultured IIV4, but not adjuvanted IIV3. However, that study was
limited by the fact that the primary outcome was based on ICD-
10 codes and not speciﬁcally on laboratory conﬁrmed inﬂuenza.
In a 2019 editorial, Flannery and Fry stated, ‘‘Evidence to inform
future policy decisions will be dependent on multiple studies with
different but complementary methods that can report on annual
results over several seasons as well as statistical models to evalu-

ate potential impact of changes in vaccine uptake.” [16] This study
adds to the evidence for the improved performance of RIV4 among
all adults, and supports its superior effectiveness over SD- IIV4 for
adults 18–64 years of age.


4.1. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS

This study has several strengths and limitations. Firstly, the
demographics of the study population were similar to those of
the Allegheny County general population of adults in which 79 %
are white and 51 % are female [17], thus contributing to generaliz-
ability. Moreover, the health system includes urban tertiary and
quaternary care hospitals as well as suburban and rural commu-
nity hospitals. It has a 60 % market share of all hospital beds in
the county and accepts patients with all insurance products. Sec-
ond, as an integrated healthcare system, its EMR is robust, with
regular uploads of vaccination data from the state immunization
registry. In addition, we veriﬁed vaccination status through the
state registry with a speciﬁc data request. In previous research,
we have demonstrated that registry data are a reasonable source
for inﬂuenza vaccination data [18]. As a result, we have conﬁdence
that inﬂuenza vaccinations are captured accurately in the EMR. If
vaccinations were not captured in the EMR or state registry, they
were classiﬁed as unvaccinated. While this classiﬁcation would
likely introduce bias into VE estimates [16], it would likely not bias
rVE estimates, as there is no reason to believe that any vaccine is
preferentially included or excluded from reporting to the state reg-
istry. This study excluded subjects with immunosuppressive con-
ditions or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy whose
response to vaccines is limited. Because data focused on hospital-
ized patients, there may have been milder cases that did not
require medical care and were not captured in the EMR, thus did
not contribute to these estimates. Adding measures of severity of
illness into the model would improve the accuracy of the VE esti-
mates, however, these measures were not available. The differ-
ences
in
severity
are
likely
narrower
given
that
all
were
sufﬁciently ill to require hospitalization, thus mitigating the need
for such an adjustment. It is possible that there may have been
selection bias among those who received inﬂuenza virus testing,
for example, clinicians may preferentially test those who are
unvaccinated against inﬂuenza thus increasing the proportion of
unvaccinated cases. Based on a previous study among patients in
this health system that found no increase in testing based on vac-
cination status [19], we feel conﬁdent that this is not a concern.
While a relatively large cohort of adults is included in this study,
the sample size of SD-IIV4 recipients may have been inadequate
to detect meaningful rVE estimates for speciﬁc subgroups.
These data should be viewed in the context of the seasons for
which data were collected. These seasons were ‘‘typical” in that
inﬂuenza began to increase in November, peaking in January and
February both seasons, and numbers of inﬂuenza-related deaths
were 28,000 in 2018–2019 and 25,000 in 2019–2020. These sea-
sons were atypical in that virtually no inﬂuenza B circulated in
2018–2019 but there were both A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) peaks
and in 2019–2020, inﬂuenza B circulated early followed by A
(H1N1) in contrast to typical seasons in which the inﬂuenza A
wave precedes the inﬂuenza B wave [14,15]. Seasons with higher
circulation of A(H3N2) may demonstrate higher rVE of RIV4,
because it is not subject to mutations to the A(H3N2) glycosylation
binding site that reduce the effectiveness of egg-based vaccines.


5. CONCLUSIONS

Both RIV4 and SD-IIV4 were signiﬁcantly effective among all
adults
against
inﬂuenza-related
hospitalizations
during
the



==================== PAGE 7 ====================

2018–2019 and 2019–2020 inﬂuenza seasons. Adjusted VEs for
RIV4, but not SD-IIV4 were signiﬁcant for each of the subgroups
tested. Relative vaccine effectiveness of RIV4 compared with SD-
IIV4 was signiﬁcant for all adults and for younger and healthier
recipients.
