      "text": "Background: Relative effectiveness of various vaccine formulations provide important input for vaccine\npolicy decisions and provider purchasing decisions. We used electronic databases to conduct a test-\nnegative case control study to determine relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of recombinant inﬂuenza\nvaccine (RIV4) compared with standard dose vaccines (SD-IIV4) against inﬂuenza hospitalization.\nMethods: Adults 18–64 and \u000165 years of age hospitalized in a large U.S. health system (19 hospitals) in\n2018–2019 and 2019–2020 who were clinically tested for inﬂuenza using reverse transcription poly-\nmerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were included. The hospital system electronic medical record\nEMR) and the state immunization registry were used to conﬁrm inﬂuenza vaccination. Propensity scores\nwith inverse probability weighting were used to adjust for potential confounders and determine rVE.\nResults: Of the 14,590 individuals included in the primary analysis, 3,338 were vaccinated with RIV4 and\n976 were vaccinated with SD-IIV4, with the balance of 10,276 being unvaccinated. Most participants\nwere white (80 %), most (70 %) had a high-risk condition, just over half were female (54 %) and age\n65 years or older (53 %). Overall RIV4 rVE was signiﬁcant when adjusted for propensity scores with\nnverse probability weights (rVE = 31; 95 % CI = 11 %, 46 %). Among younger adults (18–64 years-old),\noverall rVE of RIV4 was signiﬁcant (rVE = 29; 95 % CI = 4 %, 47 %).\nConclusions: Over all adults, both RIV4 and SD-IIV4 were effective against inﬂuenza hospitalization, with\nRIV4 providing better protection compared with SD-IIV4 overall, for females, younger adults, and those\nwith no high-risk conditions.",

Sample size calculations deter-\nmined that we had 48 % power to detect an effect size of 9.5 %\nchange from a baseline probability of 11.7 %. Post hoc sample size\ncalculations for age subgroup analyses resulted in 42 % and 20 %\npower for ages 18–64 years and \u000165 years with effect sizes of\n8.9 %, and 8.7 %, with the detectable difference of 3 % and 2.1 %\nrespectively, thus these analyses were likely to be underpowered\nto detect a signiﬁcant rVE for RIV4 over SD-IIV4. Moreover, rVE\nestimates by vaccine strain were also precluded by insufﬁcient\nsample sizes. Descriptions of variables for each group were sum-\nmarized as mean and standard deviation for age and frequencies\nand percentages for categorical data. Baseline characteristics\nbetween the vaccination groups were compared using chi-square\nor the Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and ages were\ncompared by using t-test.\nUsing adjusted odds ratios (aORs) obtained from multivariable\nlogistic regression models, adjusted VE estimates were calculated\nas (1-aOR) X 100. The dependent variable of interest was inﬂuenza\nstatus. The primary exposure of interest was vaccine type (recom-\nbinant, SD-IIV4s and in some analyses, enhanced vaccines such as\nHD-IIV4 and adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine (Adj-IV)). The CDC has\nrecommended the use of ‘‘enhanced vaccines” for adults ages 65\nand older beginning in 2022 [13]. Inﬂuenza vaccines were identi-\nﬁed through the EMR; SD-IIV4 included Aﬂuria, Fluarix, FluLaval,\nStandard Dose Fluzone and FlucelVax. HD-IIV4 was High Dose Flu-\nzone, RIV4 was Flublok and Adj-IV was FluAd. Other independent\nvariables were age, inﬂuenza season (2018–2019 and 2019–\n2020), sex, race and presence of one or more high-risk conditions.\nAdjusted VE was calculated for RIV4, SD-IIV4 and combined RIV4,\nhigh dose, egg-based and adjuvanted vaccines. Relative VE (rVE)\nwas calculated as 1 minus the ratio of adjusted VE times 100 %.\nWe conducted propensity adjustment analyses to reduce the\npotential impact of selection effects (i.e., confounding) on baseline\ncharacteristics. We estimated the propensity scores using the Gen-\neralized Boosted Regression Models (GBM) approach, which is a\nnonparametric model that allows for nonlinear relationships with\na maximum number of iterations set to the default (i.e.,10,000)\nthat minimized the balance statistics of interest. We used the bal-\nance statistic based on absolute standardized bias (also referred as\nthe effect size or absolute standardized mean difference) and sum-\nmarized across variables. We allow a maximum of three splits for\neach tree in the model, allowing for three-way interactions among\nall covariates to be considered. The shrinkage parameter was set to\n0.0005 to ensure a smooth ﬁt.\nWe also checked the balance of all the variables included in the\nmodel to assess the quality of the propensity score and evaluate\ncommon support, using a value under 0.25 as indicative of good\nbalance. We also used the balance plots to compare the propensity\nscore distributions and to evaluate the common support.\nUsing the propensity score, we calculated the inverse probabil-\nity of receiving SD-IIV4 weighting. In this approach, for an individ-\nual receiving SD-IIV4 t, the weight equals 1=ptðxÞ , where ptðxÞ is\nthe propensity score (probability that an individual with character-\nistics x receives SD-IIV4 t). A propensity score weighted logistic\nregression with inﬂuenza status as the dependent variable was ﬁt-\nted to estimate the effect of vaccine (SD-IIV4 vs. RIV4) on outcome\nand also used inverse probability weighting to estimate VE and its\n95 % conﬁdence intervals. We added covariates like high-risk con-\nditions and inﬂuenza seasons to increase the probability of achiev-\ning a good balance for the propensity score modeling. We used ﬁve\nplot methods to determine that there were no extreme values in\nthe weights (i.e., checked the balance): 1. optimization using the",

      "text": "This study has several strengths and limitations. Firstly, the\ndemographics of the study population were similar to those of\nthe Allegheny County general population of adults in which 79 %\nare white and 51 % are female [17], thus contributing to generaliz-\nability. Moreover, the health system includes urban tertiary and\nquaternary care hospitals as well as suburban and rural commu-\nnity hospitals. It has a 60 % market share of all hospital beds in\nthe county and accepts patients with all insurance products. Sec-\nond, as an integrated healthcare system, its EMR is robust, with\nregular uploads of vaccination data from the state immunization\nregistry. In addition, we veriﬁed vaccination status through the\nstate registry with a speciﬁc data request. In previous research,\nwe have demonstrated that registry data are a reasonable source\nfor inﬂuenza vaccination data [18]. As a result, we have conﬁdence\nthat inﬂuenza vaccinations are captured accurately in the EMR. If\nvaccinations were not captured in the EMR or state registry, they\nwere classiﬁed as unvaccinated. While this classiﬁcation would\nlikely introduce bias into VE estimates [16], it would likely not bias\nrVE estimates, as there is no reason to believe that any vaccine is\npreferentially included or excluded from reporting to the state reg-\nistry. This study excluded subjects with immunosuppressive con-\nditions or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy whose\nresponse to vaccines is limited. Because data focused on hospital-\nized patients, there may have been milder cases that did not\nrequire medical care and were not captured in the EMR, thus did\nnot contribute to these estimates. Adding measures of severity of\nillness into the model would improve the accuracy of the VE esti-\nmates, however, these measures were not available. The differ-\nences\nin\nseverity\nare\nlikely\nnarrower\ngiven\nthat\nall\nwere\nsufﬁciently ill to require hospitalization, thus mitigating the need\nfor such an adjustment. It is possible that there may have been\nselection bias among those who received inﬂuenza virus testing,\nfor example, clinicians may preferentially test those who are\nunvaccinated against inﬂuenza thus increasing the proportion of\nunvaccinated cases. Based on a previous study among patients in\nthis health system that found no increase in testing based on vac-\ncination status [19], we feel conﬁdent that this is not a concern.\nWhile a relatively large cohort of adults is included in this study,\nthe sample size of SD-IIV4 recipients may have been inadequate\nto detect meaningful rVE estimates for speciﬁc subgroups.\nThese data should be viewed in the context of the seasons for\nwhich data were collected. These seasons were ‘‘typical” in that\ninﬂuenza began to increase in November, peaking in January and\nFebruary both seasons, and numbers of inﬂuenza-related deaths\nwere 28,000 in 2018–2019 and 25,000 in 2019–2020. These sea-\nsons were atypical in that virtually no inﬂuenza B circulated in\n2018–2019 but there were both A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) peaks\nand in 2019–2020, inﬂuenza B circulated early followed by A\n(H1N1) in contrast to typical seasons in which the inﬂuenza A\nwave precedes the inﬂuenza B wave [14,15]. Seasons with higher\ncirculation of A(H3N2) may demonstrate higher rVE of RIV4,\nbecause it is not subject to mutations to the A(H3N2) glycosylation\nbinding site that reduce the effectiveness of egg-based vaccines.",
