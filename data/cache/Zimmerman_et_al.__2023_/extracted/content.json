We used electronic databases to conduct a test-\nnegative case control study to determine relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of recombinant inﬂuenza\nvaccine (RIV4) compared with standard dose vaccines (SD-IIV4) against inﬂuenza hospitalization.\nMethods: Adults 18–64 and \u000165 years of age hospitalized in a large U.S. health system (19 hospitals) in\n2018–2019 and 2019–2020 who were clinically tested for inﬂuenza using reverse transcription poly-\nmerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were included. The hospital system electronic medical record\nEMR) and the state immunization registry were used to conﬁrm inﬂuenza vaccination. Propensity scores\nwith inverse probability weighting were used to adjust for potential confounders and determine rVE.\nResults: Of the 14,590 individuals included in the primary analysis, 3,338 were vaccinated with RIV4 and\n976 were vaccinated with SD-IIV4 with the balance of 10 276 being unvaccinated Most participants",

In addition, we veriﬁed vaccination status through the\nstate registry with a speciﬁc data request. In previous research,\nwe have demonstrated that registry data are a reasonable source\nfor inﬂuenza vaccination data [18]. As a result, we have conﬁdence\nthat inﬂuenza vaccinations are captured accurately in the EMR. If\nvaccinations were not captured in the EMR or state registry, they\nwere classiﬁed as unvaccinated. While this classiﬁcation would\nlikely introduce bias into VE estimates [16], it would likely not bias\nrVE estimates, as there is no reason to believe that any vaccine is\npreferentially included or excluded from reporting to the state reg-\nistry. This study excluded subjects with immunosuppressive con-\nditions or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy whose\nresponse to vaccines is limited. Because data focused on hospital-\nized patients, there may have been milder cases that did not\nrequire medical care and were not captured in the EMR, thus did\nnot contribute to these estimates. Adding measures of severity of\nillness into the model would improve the accuracy of the VE esti-\nmates, however, these measures were not available. The differ-\nences\nin\nseverity\nare\nlikely\nnarrower\ngiven\nthat\nall\nwere\nsufﬁciently ill to require hospitalization, thus mitigating the need\nfor such an adjustment. It is possible that there may have been\nselection bias among those who received inﬂuenza virus testing,\nfor example, clinicians may preferentially test those who are\nunvaccinated against inﬂuenza thus increasing the proportion of\nunvaccinated cases. Based on a previous study among patients in\nthis health system that found no increase in testing based on vac-\ncination status [19], we feel conﬁdent that this is not a concern.\nWhile a relatively large cohort of adults is included in this study,\nthe sample size of SD-IIV4 recipients may have been inadequate\nto detect meaningful rVE estimates for speciﬁc subgroups.\nThese data should be viewed in the context of the seasons for\nwhich data were collected. These seasons were ‘‘typical” in that\ninﬂuenza began to increase in November, peaking in January and\nFebruary both seasons, and numbers of inﬂuenza-related deaths\nwere 28,000 in 2018–2019 and 25,000 in 2019–2020. These sea-\nsons were atypical in that virtually no inﬂuenza B circulated in\n2018–2019 but there were both A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) peaks\nand in 2019–2020, inﬂuenza B circulated early followed by A\n(H1N1) in contrast to typical seasons in which the inﬂuenza A",
