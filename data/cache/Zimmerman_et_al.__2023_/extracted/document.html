Patients<br>Patients were individuals 18 years and older as of August 1 each<br>season who were hospitalized in one of nineteen UPMC hospitals<br>in central and southwestern Pennsylvania and had a test for inﬂu-<br>enza at any time between 11/01/2018 and 04/30/2020. A Ther-<br>adoc database (an infection control software) was used to<br>identify those tested for inﬂuenza using reverse transcription poly-<br>merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays performed in a centralized<br>clinical lab for some hospitals and individual hospital labs for<br>others.

<div class="text">Reasonably accurate VE and relative VE (rVE) estimates depend<br>upon having access to a sufﬁcient number of recipients of any<br>given vaccine type.

<div class="text">ond, as an integrated healthcare system, its EMR is robust, with<br>regular uploads of vaccination data from the state immunization<br>registry. In addition, we veriﬁed vaccination status through the<br>state registry with a speciﬁc data request. In previous research,<br>we have demonstrated that registry data are a reasonable source<br>for inﬂuenza vaccination data [18]. As a result, we have conﬁdence<br>that inﬂuenza vaccinations are captured accurately in the EMR. If<br>vaccinations were not captured in the EMR or state registry, they<br>were classiﬁed as unvaccinated. While this classiﬁcation would<br>likely introduce bias into VE estimates [16], it would likely not bias<br>rVE estimates, as there is no reason to believe that any vaccine is<br>preferentially included or excluded from reporting to the state reg-<br>istry. This study excluded subjects with immunosuppressive con-<br>ditions or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy whose<br>response to vaccines is limited. Because data focused on hospital-<br>ized patients, there may have been milder cases that did not<br>require medical care and were not captured in the EMR, thus did<br>not contribute to these estimates. Adding measures of severity of<br>illness into the model would improve the accuracy of the VE esti-<br>mates, however, these measures were not available. The differ-<br>ences<br>in<br>severity<br>are<br>likely<br>narrower<br>given<br>that<br>all<br>were<br>sufﬁciently ill to require hospitalization, thus mitigating the need<br>for such an adjustment. It is possible that there may have been<br>selection bias among those who received inﬂuenza virus testing,<br>for example, clinicians may preferentially test those who are<br>unvaccinated against inﬂuenza thus increasing the proportion of<br>unvaccinated cases. Based on a previous study among patients in<br>this health system that found no increase in testing based on vac-<br>cination status [19], we feel conﬁdent that this is not a concern.<br>While a relatively large cohort of adults is included in this study,<br>the sample size of SD-IIV4 recipients may have been inadequate<br>to detect meaningful rVE estimates for speciﬁc subgroups.<br>These data should be viewed in the context of the seasons for<br>which data were collected. These seasons were ‘‘typical” in that<br>inﬂuenza began to increase in November, peaking in January and<br>February both seasons, and numbers of inﬂuenza-related deaths<br>were 28,000 in 2018–2019 and 25,000 in 2019–2020. These sea-<br>sons were atypical in that virtually no inﬂuenza B circulated in<br>2018–2019 but there were both A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) peaks<br>and in 2019–2020, inﬂuenza B circulated early followed by A<br>(H1N1) in contrast to typical seasons in which the inﬂuenza A</div>
