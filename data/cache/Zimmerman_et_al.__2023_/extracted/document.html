Background: Relative effectiveness of various vaccine formulations provide important input for vaccine policy decisions and provider purchasing decisions. We used electronic databases to conduct a test negative case control study to determine relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) compared with standard dose vaccines (SD-IIV4) against influenza hospitalization. Methods: Adults 18–64 and 65 years of age hospitalized in a large U.S. health system (19 hospitals) in 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 who were clinically tested for influenza using reverse transcription poly- merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as says were included. The hospital system electronic medical record (EMR) and the state immunization registry were used to confirm influenza vaccination. Propensity scores with inverse probability weighting were used to adjust for potential con founders and determine rVE. Results: Of the 14 590 individuals included in the primary analysis, 3,338 were vaccinated with RIV4 and 976 were vaccinated with SD-IIV4, with the balance of 10 276 being un vaccinated.

A Ther- adoc database (an infection control software) was used to identify those tested for influenza using reverse transcription poly- merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as says performed in a centralized clinical lab for some hospitals and individual hospital labs for others. Influenza cases were those who tested positive for in flu enza and controls were those who tested negative for influenza, regardless of any other identified viral infection.

This study is a retrospective test negative case control study of influenza VE against hospitalization using data from electronic medical records (EMR) of a single large health system to determine the rVE of RIV4 among adults 18–64 and 65 years of age in the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 seasons. 2.

<div class="text">Reasonably accurate VE and relative VE (rVE) estimates depend upon having access to a sufficient number of recipients of any given vaccine type. Research on high dose quad rival ent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4) has reported rVE for HD-IIV4 compared with standard dose quad rival ent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) of 24% against laboratory confirmed influenza [7] and 27% against in flu enza hospitalization [8]. Several studies of cell cultured influenza vaccine were conducted prior to the 2019-2020 season (when all four vaccine strains were cell cultured and have not shown sign if icant rVE against influenza illness compared with SD-IIV4 [9]. A large retrospective study of Medicare beneficiaries (65 years of age) in the 2019-2020 season demonstrated no significant rVE of cell cultured quad rival ent influenza vaccine (ccIIV4) compared with SD-IIV4 against influenza related hospital encounters [10].

<div class="text">each tree in the model, allowing for three way interactions among all covariates to be considered. The shrinkage parameter was set to 0 0005 to ensure a smooth fit. We also checked the balance of all the variables included in the model to assess the quality of the propensity score and evaluate common support, using a value under 0.25 as indicative of good balance. We also used the balance plots to compare the propensity score distributions and to evaluate the common support. Using the propensity score, we calculated the inverse pro babil ity of receiving SD-IIV4 weighting. In this approach, for an individ- ual receiving SD-IIV4 t, the weight equals 1=ptðxÞ, where ptðxÞ is the propensity score (probability that an individual with character- is tics xreceives SD-IIV4 t). A propensity score weighted logistic regression with influenza status as the dependent variable was fit- ted to estimate the effect of vaccine (SD-IIV4 vs. RIV4) on outcome and also used inverse probability weighting to estimate VE and its 95% confidence intervals. We added covariates like high risk con-</div>
<div class="text">gzone, RIV4 was Flublok and Adj-IV was FluAd. Other independent variables were age, influenza season (2018-2019 and 2019– 2020), sex, race and presence of one or more high risk conditions. Adjusted VE was calculated for RIV4, SD-IIV4 and combined RIV4, high dose, egg based and adjuvanted vaccines. Relative VE (rVE) was calculated as 1 minus the ratio of adjusted VE times 100%. We conducted propensity adjustment analyses to reduce the potential impact of selection effects (i.e., confounding) on baseline characteristics. We estimated the propensity scores using the Gen- eralized Boosted Regression Models (GBM) approach, which is an on parametric model that allows for nonlinear relationships with a maximum number of iterations set to the default (i.e.,10,000) that minimized the balance statistics of interest. We used the bal- ance statistic based on absolute standardized bias (also referred as the effect size or absolute standardized mean difference) and sum-</div>
<div class="text">and percentages for categorical data. Baseline characteristics between the vaccination groups were compared using chi square or the Fisher’sexact tests for categorical variables and ages were compared by using t-test. Using adjusted odds ratios (aORs) obtained from multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted VE estimates were calculated as (1-aOR) X 100. The dependent variable of interest was influenza status. The primary exposure of interest was vaccine type (recom- bin ant, SD-IIV4 s and in some analyses, enhanced vaccines such as HD-IIV4 and adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Adj-IV)). The CDC has recommended the use of ‘‘enhanced vaccines” for adults ages 65 and older beginning in 2022 [13]. Influenza vaccines were ident i fied through the EMR; SD-IIV4 included Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval,</div>
<div class="text">respectively, thus these analyses were likely to be underpowered to detect a significant rVE for RIV4 over SD-IIV4. Moreover, rVE estimates by vaccine strain were also precluded by insufficient sample sizes.

<div class="text">2.2. Statistical methods For primary analysis, all adults 18 years were included, then for secondary analyses, they were stratified into age groups 65 years, and 18–64 years. Sample size calculations deter- mined that we had 48% power to detect an effect size of 9.5% change from a baseline probability of 11.7%. Post hoc sample size calculations for age subgroup analyses resulted in 42% and 20% power for ages 18–64 years and 65 years with effect sizes of 8.9%, and 8.7%, with the detectable difference of 3% and 2.1% Vaccine 41 (2023) 5134-5140</div>

<div class="text">, g y , , regular uploads of vaccination data from the state immunization registry. In addition, we verified vaccination status through the state registry with a specific data request. In previous research, we have demonstrated that registry data are a reasonable source for influenza vaccination data [18]. As a result, we have confidence that influenza vaccinations are captured accurately in the EMR. If vaccinations were not captured in the EMR or state registry, they were classified as un vaccinated. While this classification would likely introduce bias into VE estimates [16], it would likely not bias rVE estimates, as there is no reason to believe that any vaccine is preferentially included or excluded from reporting to the state reg- istry. This study excluded subjects with immuno suppress ive con- dit ions or those receiving immuno suppress ive therapy whose response to vaccines is limited. Because data focused on hospital- ized patients, there may have been milder cases that did not require medical care and were not captured in the EMR, thus did not contribute to these estimates. Adding measures of severity of illness into the model would improve the accuracy of the VE esti- mates, however, these measures were not available. The differ- ences in severity are likely narrower given that all were sufficiently ill to require hospitalization, thus mitigating the need for such an adjustment. It is possible that there may have been selection bias among those who received influenza virus testing, for example, clinicians may preferentially test those who are un vaccinated against influenza thus increasing the proportion of un vaccinated cases. Based on a previous study among patients in this health system that found no increase in testing based on vac- ci nation status [19], we feel confident that this is not a concern. While a relatively large cohort of adults is included in this study, the sample size of SD-IIV4 recipients may have been inadequate to detect meaningful rVE estimates for specific subgroups. These data should be viewed in the context of the seasons for which data were collected. These seasons were ‘‘typical” in that influenza began to increase in November, peaking in January and February both seasons, and numbers of influenza related deaths were 28 000 in 2018-2019 and 25 000 in 2019-2020. These sea- sons were atypical in that virtually no influenza B circulated in 2018-2019 but there were both A (H1 N1) and A (H3 N2) peaks and in 2019-2020, influenza B circulated early followed by A (H1 N1) in contrast to typical seasons in which the influenza A dth i fl B [14 15] S ith hi h</div>
