<div class="text">Background: Relative effectiveness of various vaccine formulations provide important input for vaccine<br>policy decisions and provider purchasing decisions. We used electronic databases to conduct a test-<br>negative case control study to determine relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of recombinant inﬂuenza<br>vaccine (RIV4) compared with standard dose vaccines (SD-IIV4) against inﬂuenza hospitalization.<br>Methods: Adults 18–64 and 65 years of age hospitalized in a large U.S. health system (19 hospitals) in<br>2018–2019 and 2019–2020 who were clinically tested for inﬂuenza using reverse transcription poly-<br>merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were included. The hospital system electronic medical record<br>EMR) and the state immunization registry were used to conﬁrm inﬂuenza vaccination. Propensity scores<br>with inverse probability weighting were used to adjust for potential confounders and determine rVE.<br>Results: Of the 14,590 individuals included in the primary analysis, 3,338 were vaccinated with RIV4 and<br>976 were vaccinated with SD-IIV4, with the balance of 10,276 being unvaccinated. Most participants<br>were white (80 %), most (70 %) had a high-risk condition, just over half were female (54 %) and age<br>65 years or older (53 %). Overall RIV4 rVE was signiﬁcant when adjusted for propensity scores with<br>nverse probability weights (rVE = 31; 95 % CI = 11 %, 46 %). Among younger adults (18–64 years-old),<br>overall rVE of RIV4 was signiﬁcant (rVE = 29; 95 % CI = 4 %, 47 %).<br>Conclusions: Over all adults, both RIV4 and SD-IIV4 were effective against inﬂuenza hospitalization, with<br>RIV4 providing better protection compared with SD-IIV4 overall, for females, younger adults, and those<br>with no high-risk conditions.</div>

<div class="text">and over, inﬂuenza remains a major cause of morbidity, hospital-<br>izations and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide. Over the last<br>1–2 decades, effectiveness of egg-based standard dose inﬂuenza<br>vaccine has been modest [1–5]. New inﬂuenza vaccine formula-<br>tions, designed to improve upon the effectiveness of these vacci-<br>nes, have been introduced in the U.S. over the past several years<br>including high dose- and adjuvanted egg-based vaccines. In addi-<br>tion, egg-free vaccines manufactured using cell-culture and recom-<br>binant<br>technologies<br>have<br>been<br>licensed<br>that<br>avoid<br>the<br>glycosylation site binding issues associated with egg adaptation<br>[6] that have been shown to reduce vaccine effectiveness (VE<br>against A(H3N2) strains.</div>

<div class="text">Reasonably accurate VE and relative VE (rVE) estimates depend<br>upon having access to a sufﬁcient number of recipients of any<br>given vaccine type. Research on high dose quadrivalent inﬂuenza<br>vaccine (HD-IIV4) has reported rVE for HD-IIV4 compared with<br>standard dose quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) of 24 %<br>against laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza [7] and 27 % against inﬂu-<br>enza hospitalization [8]. Several studies of cell-cultured inﬂuenza<br>vaccine were conducted prior to the 2019–2020 season (when all<br>four vaccine strains were cell-cultured) and have not shown signif-<br>icant rVE against inﬂuenza illness compared with SD-IIV4 [9]. A<br>large retrospective study of Medicare beneﬁciaries (65 years of<br>age) in the 2019–2020 season demonstrated no signiﬁcant rVE of<br>cell-cultured quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (ccIIV4) compared<br>with SD-IIV4 against inﬂuenza-related hospital encounters [10].<br>However, the study was limited by the fact that there were no<br>laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza outcomes. Thus, the full beneﬁt<br>of cell-culture vaccine technology is still largely unknown.<br>Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadriva-<br>lent inﬂuenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneﬁciaries study<br>[10] using retrospective data as described above, reported signiﬁ-<br>cant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4) against inﬂuenza-related hospital<br>encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found<br>signiﬁcant<br>rVE<br>of<br>RIV4<br>compared<br>with<br>SD-IIV4<br>among<br>adults 50 years old, but not for adults 65 years old [11].<br>Given the higher cost of newer vaccines, and the high risk of<br>inﬂuenza complications for certain groups, including the elderly<br>[12], there is interest in providing the most effective vaccine to<br>the largest number of patients to prevent inﬂuenza-related mor-<br>bidity and mortality. Additional rVE studies of new vaccine formu-<br>lations are needed to help determine vaccination best practices.<br>This study is a retrospective test-negative case-control study of<br>inﬂuenza VE against hospitalization using data from electronic<br>medical records (EMR) of a single large health system to determine<br>the rVE of RIV4 among adults 18–64 and 65 years of age in the<br>2018–2019 and 2019–2020 seasons.</div>
<div class="title">2. Methods</div>
<div class="text">The<br>University<br>of<br>Pittsburgh<br>Institutional<br>Review<br>Board<br>approved this retrospective study using EMR databases. A test-<br>negative case-control study estimates VE by comparing the odds<br>of vaccination among patients hospitalized with inﬂuenza like ill-<br>ness with conﬁrmed inﬂuenza to the odds of vaccination among<br>controls, i.e., patients hospitalized with inﬂuenza like illness who<br>tested negative for inﬂuenza.</div>
<div class="title">2.1. Patients</div>
<div class="text">Patients were individuals 18 years and older as of August 1 each<br>season who were hospitalized in one of nineteen UPMC hospitals<br>in central and southwestern Pennsylvania and had a test for inﬂu-<br>enza at any time between 11/01/2018 and 04/30/2020. A Ther-<br>adoc database (an infection control software) was used to<br>identify those tested for inﬂuenza using reverse transcription poly-<br>merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays performed in a centralized<br>clinical lab for some hospitals and individual hospital labs for<br>others. Inﬂuenza cases were those who tested positive for inﬂu-<br>enza and controls were those who tested negative for inﬂuenza<br>regardless of any other identiﬁed viral infection. Both the EMR<br>and Pennsylvania Statewide Immunization Information System<br>(PA-SIIS) were queried for inﬂuenza vaccines given between<br>August 1 and the date of illness/PCR testing. Exclusion criteria were<br>testing within 2 weeks of vaccination, having 2 different types of<br>inﬂuenza vaccine in a season, missing and unknown vaccination<br>information and having an immunocompromising condition.</div>
<div class="title">2.2. Statistical methods</div>
<div class="text">For primary analysis, all adults 18 years were included, then<br>for<br>secondary<br>analyses,<br>they<br>were<br>stratiﬁed<br>into<br>age<br>groups 65 years, and 18–64 years. Sample size calculations deter-<br>mined that we had 48 % power to detect an effect size of 9.5 %<br>change from a baseline probability of 11.7 %. Post hoc sample size<br>calculations for age subgroup analyses resulted in 42 % and 20 %<br>power for ages 18–64 years and 65 years with effect sizes of<br>8.9 %, and 8.7 %, with the detectable difference of 3 % and 2.1 %<br>respectively, thus these analyses were likely to be underpowered<br>to detect a signiﬁcant rVE for RIV4 over SD-IIV4. Moreover, rVE<br>estimates by vaccine strain were also precluded by insufﬁcient<br>sample sizes. Descriptions of variables for each group were sum-<br>marized as mean and standard deviation for age and frequencies<br>and percentages for categorical data. Baseline characteristics<br>between the vaccination groups were compared using chi-square<br>or the Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and ages were<br>compared by using t-test.<br>Using adjusted odds ratios (aORs) obtained from multivariable<br>logistic regression models, adjusted VE estimates were calculated<br>as (1-aOR) X 100. The dependent variable of interest was inﬂuenza<br>status. The primary exposure of interest was vaccine type (recom-<br>binant, SD-IIV4s and in some analyses, enhanced vaccines such as<br>HD-IIV4 and adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine (Adj-IV)). The CDC has<br>recommended the use of ‘‘enhanced vaccines” for adults ages 65<br>and older beginning in 2022 [13]. Inﬂuenza vaccines were identi-<br>ﬁed through the EMR; SD-IIV4 included Aﬂuria, Fluarix, FluLaval,<br>Standard Dose Fluzone and FlucelVax. HD-IIV4 was High Dose Flu-<br>zone, RIV4 was Flublok and Adj-IV was FluAd. Other independent<br>variables were age, inﬂuenza season (2018–2019 and 2019–<br>2020), sex, race and presence of one or more high-risk conditions.<br>Adjusted VE was calculated for RIV4, SD-IIV4 and combined RIV4,<br>high dose, egg-based and adjuvanted vaccines. Relative VE (rVE)<br>was calculated as 1 minus the ratio of adjusted VE times 100 %.<br>We conducted propensity adjustment analyses to reduce the<br>potential impact of selection effects (i.e., confounding) on baseline<br>characteristics. We estimated the propensity scores using the Gen-<br>eralized Boosted Regression Models (GBM) approach, which is a<br>nonparametric model that allows for nonlinear relationships with<br>a maximum number of iterations set to the default (i.e.,10,000)<br>that minimized the balance statistics of interest. We used the bal-<br>ance statistic based on absolute standardized bias (also referred as<br>the effect size or absolute standardized mean difference) and sum-<br>marized across variables. We allow a maximum of three splits for<br>each tree in the model, allowing for three-way interactions among<br>all covariates to be considered. The shrinkage parameter was set to<br>0.0005 to ensure a smooth ﬁt.<br>We also checked the balance of all the variables included in the<br>model to assess the quality of the propensity score and evaluate<br>common support, using a value under 0.25 as indicative of good<br>balance. We also used the balance plots to compare the propensity<br>score distributions and to evaluate the common support.<br>Using the propensity score, we calculated the inverse probabil-<br>ity of receiving SD-IIV4 weighting. In this approach, for an individ-<br>ual receiving SD-IIV4 t, the weight equals 1=ptðxÞ , where ptðxÞ is<br>the propensity score (probability that an individual with character-<br>istics x receives SD-IIV4 t). A propensity score weighted logistic<br>regression with inﬂuenza status as the dependent variable was ﬁt-<br>ted to estimate the effect of vaccine (SD-IIV4 vs. RIV4) on outcome<br>and also used inverse probability weighting to estimate VE and its<br>95 % conﬁdence intervals. We added covariates like high-risk con-<br>ditions and inﬂuenza seasons to increase the probability of achiev-<br>ing a good balance for the propensity score modeling. We used ﬁve<br>plot methods to determine that there were no extreme values in<br>the weights (i.e., checked the balance): 1. optimization using the</div>

<div class="text">The total number of inﬂuenza test results among inpatients was<br>18,467 of which 530 were excluded because of missing vaccination<br>information or vaccination < 14 days before illness, and 3,264 were<br>excluded from the primary analyses because patients were<br>immunocompromised or received enhanced vaccines other than<br>RIV4 (n = 613), leaving 14,590 for the primary analysis (Fig. 1).<br>Of these, 3,338 were vaccinated with RIV4 and 976 were vacci-<br>nated with SD-IIV4, with the balance of 10,276 being unvaccinated.<br>For the secondary analyses, the analyzable cohort included the 613<br>HD-IIV4 and Adj-IV recipients bringing the total analyzable sample<br>to 15,203 (Fig. 2). The inﬂuenza positivity rate was 12.4 %<br>(1,803/14,590) overall, 14.4 % among younger adults 18–64 years<br>and 11.1 % (922/8306) among those 65 years, with the addition<br>of 613 patients who received enhanced vaccines that were not<br>included in the primary analysis.<br>Demographic characteristics of the population for the primary<br>analyses are shown in Table 1; most participants were white<br>(80 %), just over half were female (54 %) and age 65 years or older</div>

<div class="text">Table 2 shows adjusted VE for both RIV4 and SD-IIV4s and rVE<br>of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4s. VE of RIV4 was signiﬁcant against<br>inﬂuenza hospitalizations overall (36 %; 95 % CI = 27, 45) and for<br>population subgroups based on sex, age and risk conditions. VE<br>of SD-IIV4 was signiﬁcant overall (24 %; 95 % CI = 6, 38) and for<br>males and younger adults, but not for other subgroups. Overall<br>rVE for RIV4 vs SD-IIV4 against inﬂuenza hospitalization was sig-<br>niﬁcant when adjusted for propensity scores with inverse probabil-<br>ity weights (rVE = 31%; 95 % CI = 11, 46). Subgroup analyses by age<br>and risk group identiﬁed signiﬁcant rVE for recombinant inﬂuenza<br>vaccine among females (rVE = 37%; 95 % CI = 13, 54), younger<br>adults 18–64 years old (rVE = 28%; 95 % CI = 3, 46) and for those<br>without high-risk conditions (rVE = 60%; 95 % CI = 29, 78).<br>In secondary analyses, the participants, including those who<br>received HD-IIV4 and Adj-IV, were then divided in two age groups<br>(18–64 and 65 years) to calculate rVE. Characteristics of these<br>groups by vaccine type are shown in Table 3. Among younger<br>adults, receipt of RIV4 was signiﬁcantly associated with non-<br>white race (83.7 % RIV4 vs. 71.8 % SD-IIV4; P < 0.001), fewer cases<br>of inﬂuenza (9.2 % RIV4 vs. 11.9 % SD-IIV4; P < 0.041) and having a<br>high-risk condition (83.2 % RIV4 vs. 66.8 % SD-IIV4; P < 0.001).<br>Among older adults, receipt of RIV4 was signiﬁcantly associated<br>with having a high-risk condition (91.1 % RIV4 vs. 78.4 % SD-IIV4<br>P < 0.001). In a second scenario older adults receiving SD-IIV4 were<br>compared with those receiving RIV4, HD-IIV4, or Adj-IV , because<br>these latter two ‘‘enhanced” vaccines are now recommended for<br>adults 65 years. Again, having a high-risk condition was associ-<br>ated with receipt of one of these vaccines (87.5 % combined vs.<br>78.4 % SD-IIV4; P < 0.001).<br>Adjusted VEs for RIV4 for younger adults were signiﬁcant across<br>all subgroups, whereas, VE for SD-IIV4 was signiﬁcant for males<br>only. Among older adults, VE of RIV4 was signiﬁcant for females<br>(47 %; 95 % CI = 30, 60) but not males (2 %; 95 % CI = –33, 21)<br>or for those with and without high-risk conditions. VEs for<br>those 65 years old receiving RIV4, HD-IV4 or Adj-IV showed sim-<br>ilar patterns of signiﬁcance across subgroups (overall VE = 24 %;<br>95 % CI = 11, 36; females VE = 38 %; 95 % CI = 22, 51); high risk</div>

<div class="text">Among over 14,000 mostly white, and mostly high-risk adult<br>patients hospitalized for an acute respiratory infection in 2018–<br>2019 and 2019–2020, 12 % were diagnosed with inﬂuenza.

<div class="text">ical<br>conditions,<br>placing<br>them<br>at<br>high<br>risk<br>for<br>inﬂuenza<br>complications.<br>Among all adults hospitalized for acute respiratory infections,<br>both RIV4 and SD-IIV4 were signiﬁcantly effective overall against<br>inﬂuenza hospitalizations, but only RIV4 was effective for all sub-<br>groups tested in this analysis. The differences in VE of RIV4 and<br>SD-IIV4 were reﬂected in overall signiﬁcant rVE for RIV4. However,<br>within the overall population, rVE of RIV4 was signiﬁcant for<br>females, younger adults and those without high-risk conditions,<br>the latter two groups being those who were less likely to receive<br>RIV4. When stratiﬁed by age groups, rVE of RIV4 of younger adults<br>was signiﬁcant overall, among males and those without a high-risk<br>condition; whereas, among older adults, neither RIV4 nor all high<br>dose or adjuvanted vaccines combined was signiﬁcantly more<br>effective than standard dose IIV4. This was likely due to limited<br>use of the SD-IIV4 (only 213 seniors received SD-IIV4), resulting<br>in large conﬁdence intervals. The large market share in our<br>study of RIV4, HD-IIV4 and Adj-IV in senior adults, relative to<br>SD-IIV4 limited our analysis and seemingly anticipated the 2022<br>decision by ACIP to recommend these three vaccines for older<br>adults [13].</div>

<div class="text">ate potential impact of changes in vaccine uptake.” [16] This study<br>adds to the evidence for the improved performance of RIV4 among<br>all adults, and supports its superior effectiveness over SD- IIV4 for<br>adults 18–64 years of age.</div>
<div class="title">4.1. Strengths and limitations</div>
<div class="text">This study has several strengths and limitations. Firstly, the<br>demographics of the study population were similar to those of<br>the Allegheny County general population of adults in which 79 %<br>are white and 51 % are female [17], thus contributing to generaliz-<br>ability. Moreover, the health system includes urban tertiary and<br>quaternary care hospitals as well as suburban and rural commu-<br>nity hospitals. It has a 60 % market share of all hospital beds in<br>the county and accepts patients with all insurance products. Sec-<br>ond, as an integrated healthcare system, its EMR is robust, with<br>regular uploads of vaccination data from the state immunization<br>registry. In addition, we veriﬁed vaccination status through the<br>state registry with a speciﬁc data request. In previous research,<br>we have demonstrated that registry data are a reasonable source<br>for inﬂuenza vaccination data [18]. As a result, we have conﬁdence<br>that inﬂuenza vaccinations are captured accurately in the EMR. If<br>vaccinations were not captured in the EMR or state registry, they<br>were classiﬁed as unvaccinated. While this classiﬁcation would<br>likely introduce bias into VE estimates [16], it would likely not bias<br>rVE estimates, as there is no reason to believe that any vaccine is<br>preferentially included or excluded from reporting to the state reg-<br>istry. This study excluded subjects with immunosuppressive con-<br>ditions or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy whose<br>response to vaccines is limited. Because data focused on hospital-<br>ized patients, there may have been milder cases that did not<br>require medical care and were not captured in the EMR, thus did<br>not contribute to these estimates. Adding measures of severity of<br>illness into the model would improve the accuracy of the VE esti-<br>mates, however, these measures were not available. The differ-<br>ences<br>in<br>severity<br>are<br>likely<br>narrower<br>given<br>that<br>all<br>were<br>sufﬁciently ill to require hospitalization, thus mitigating the need<br>for such an adjustment. It is possible that there may have been<br>selection bias among those who received inﬂuenza virus testing,<br>for example, clinicians may preferentially test those who are<br>unvaccinated against inﬂuenza thus increasing the proportion of<br>unvaccinated cases. Based on a previous study among patients in<br>this health system that found no increase in testing based on vac-<br>cination status [19], we feel conﬁdent that this is not a concern.<br>While a relatively large cohort of adults is included in this study,<br>the sample size of SD-IIV4 recipients may have been inadequate<br>to detect meaningful rVE estimates for speciﬁc subgroups.<br>These data should be viewed in the context of the seasons for<br>which data were collected. These seasons were ‘‘typical” in that<br>inﬂuenza began to increase in November, peaking in January and<br>February both seasons, and numbers of inﬂuenza-related deaths<br>were 28,000 in 2018–2019 and 25,000 in 2019–2020. These sea-<br>sons were atypical in that virtually no inﬂuenza B circulated in<br>2018–2019 but there were both A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) peaks<br>and in 2019–2020, inﬂuenza B circulated early followed by A<br>(H1N1) in contrast to typical seasons in which the inﬂuenza A<br>wave precedes the inﬂuenza B wave [14,15]. Seasons with higher<br>circulation of A(H3N2) may demonstrate higher rVE of RIV4,<br>because it is not subject to mutations to the A(H3N2) glycosylation<br>binding site that reduce the effectiveness of egg-based vaccines.</div>
<div class="title">5. Conclusions</div>
<div class="text">Both RIV4 and SD-IIV4 were signiﬁcantly effective among all<br>adults<br>against<br>inﬂuenza-related<br>hospitalizations<br>during<br>the</div>
