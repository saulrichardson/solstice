<div class="text">2.1. Patients Patients were individuals 18 years and older as of August 1 each season who were hospitalized in one of nineteen UPMC hospitals in central and southwestern Pennsylvania and had atest for influenza at any time between 11 01 2018 and 04 30 2020. A Thera doc database (an infection control software) was used to identify those tested for influenza using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as says performed in a centralized clinical lab for some hospitals and individual hospital labs for others. Influenza cases were those who tested positive for influenza and controls were those who tested negative for influenza, regardless of any other identified viral infection. Both the EMR and Pennsylvania Statewide Immunization Information System (PA-SIIS) were queried for influenza vaccines given between August 1 and the date of illness/PCR testing.

This study is a retrospective test negative case control study of influenza VE against hospitalization using data from electronic medical records (EMR) of a single large health system to determine the rVE of RIV4 among adults 18-64 and 65 years of age in the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 seasons. 2.

<div class="text">Reasonably accurate VE and relative VE (rVE) estimates depend upon having access to a sufficient number of recipients of any given vaccine type. Research on high dose quad rival ent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4) has reported rVE for HD-IIV4 compared with standard dose quad rival ent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) of 24% against laboratory confirmed influenza [7] and 27% against influenza hospitalization [8]. Several studies of cell cultured influenza vaccine were conducted prior to the 2019-2020 season (when all four vaccine strains were cell cultured and have not shown significant rVE against influenza illness compared with SD-IIV4 [9]. A large retrospective study of Medicare beneficiaries (65 years of age) in the 2019-2020 season demonstrated no significant rVE of cell cultured quad rival ent influenza vaccine (ccIIV4) compared with SD-IIV4 against influenza related hospital encounters [10].

The shrinkage parameter was set to 0 0005 to ensure a smooth fit. We also checked the balance of all the variables included in the model to assess the quality of the propensity score and evaluate common support, using a value under 0.25 as indicative of good balance. We also used the balance plots to compare the propensity score distributions and to evaluate the common support. Using the propensity score, we calculated the inverse probability of receiving SD-IIV4 weighting. In this approach, for an individual receiving SD-IIV4 t, the weight equals 1=ptðxÞ, where ptðxÞ is the propensity score (probability that an individual with characteristics xreceives SD-IIV4 t). A propensity score weighted logistic regression with influenza status as the dependent variable was fitted to estimate the effect of vaccine (SD-IIV4 vs. RIV4) on outcome and also used inverse probability weighting to estimate VE and its 95% confidence intervals We added covariates like high risk con</div>
<div class="text">Standard Dose Flu zone and FlucelVax. HD-IIV4 was High Dose Flu zone, RIV4 was Flublok and Adj-IV was FluAd. Other independent variables were age, influenza season (2018-2019 and 20192020), sex, race and presence of one or more high risk conditions. Adjusted VE was calculated for RIV4, SD-IIV4 and combined RIV4, high dose, egg based and adjuvanted vaccines. Relative VE (rVE) was calculated as 1 minus the ratio of adjusted VE times 100%. We conducted propensity adjustment analyses to reduce the potential impact of selection effects (i.e., confounding) on baseline characteristics. We estimated the propensity scores using the Generalized Boosted Regression Models (GBM) approach, which is an on parametric model that allows for nonlinear relationships with a maximum number of iterations set to the default (i.e.,10,000) that minimized the balance statistics of interest. We used the balance statistic based on absolute standardized bias (also referred as the effect size or absolute standardized mean difference) and summarized across variables. We allow a maximum of three splits for</div>
<div class="text">and percentages for categorical data. Baseline characteristics between the vaccination groups were compared using chi square or the Fisher’sexact tests for categorical variables and ages were compared by using t-test. Using adjusted odds ratios (aORs) obtained from multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted VE estimates were calculated as (1-aOR) X 100. The dependent variable of interest was influenza status. The primary exposure of interest was vaccine type (recombinant, SD-IIV4 s and in some analyses, enhanced vaccines such as HD-IIV4 and adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Adj-IV)). The CDC has recommended the use of ‘‘enhanced vaccines” for adults ages 65 and older beginning in 2022 [13]. Influenza vaccines were identified through the EMR; SD-IIV4 included Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, Standard Dose Flu zone and FlucelVax HD-IIV4 was High Dose Flu-</div>

Post hoc sample size calculations for age subgroup analyses resulted in 42% and 20% power for ages 18-64 years and 65 years with effect sizes of 8.9%, and 8.7%, with the detectable difference of 3% and 2.1% respectively thus these analyses were likely to be underpowered Vaccine 41 (2023) 5134-5140</div>

<div class="text">ond, as an integrated healthcare system, its EMR is robust, with regular uploads of vaccination data from the state immunization registry. In addition, we verified vaccination status through the state registry with a specific data request. In previous research, we have demonstrated that registry data are a reasonable source for influenza vaccination data [18]. As a result, we have confidence that influenza vaccinations are captured accurately in the EMR. If vaccinations were not captured in the EMR or state registry, they were classified as un vaccinated. While this classification would likely introduce bias into VE estimates [16], it would likely not bias rVE estimates, as there is no reason to believe that any vaccine is preferentially included or excluded from reporting to the state registry. This study excluded subjects with immuno suppress ive conditions or those receiving immuno suppress ive therapy whose response to vaccines is limited. Because data focused on hospitalized patients, there may have been milder cases that did not require medical care and were not captured in the EMR, thus did not contribute to these estimates. Adding measures of severity of illness into the model would improve the accuracy of the VE estimates, however, these measures were not available. The differences in severity are likely narrower given that all were sufficiently ill to require hospitalization, thus mitigating the need for such an adjustment. It is possible that there may have been selection bias among those who received influenza virus testing, for example, clinicians may preferentially test those who are un vaccinated against influenza thus increasing the proportion of un vaccinated cases. Based on a previous study among patients in this health system that found no increase in testing based on vaccination status [19], we feel confident that this is not a concern. While a relatively large cohort of adults is included in this study, the sample size of SD-IIV4 recipients may have been inadequate to detect meaningful rVE estimates for specific subgroups. These data should be viewed in the context of the seasons for which data were collected. These seasons were ‘‘typical” in that influenza began to increase in November, peaking in January and February both seasons, and numbers of influenza related deaths were 28 000 in 2018-2019 and 25 000 in 2019-2020. These seasons were atypical in that virtually no influenza B circulated in 2018-2019 but there were both A (H1 N1) and A (H3 N2) peaks and in 2019-2020, influenza B circulated early followed by A (H1 N1) in contrast to typical seasons in which the influenza A</div>
