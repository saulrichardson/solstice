### 1. Introduction
Despite the availability of an array of inﬂuenza vaccines and
recommendations for vaccination of individuals age 6 months
and over, inﬂuenza remains a major cause of
izations and mortality in the U.S. and world
1–2 decades, effectiveness of egg-based stand
vaccine has been modest [1–5]. New inﬂuenz

Conclusions: Over all adults, both RIV4 and SD-IIV4 were effective against inﬂuenza hospitalization,
RIV4 providing better protection compared with SD-IIV4 overall, for females, younger adults, and
with no high-risk conditions.

Background: Relative effectiveness of various vaccine formulations provide important input for vaccine
policy decisions and provider purchasing decisions. We used electronic databases to conduct a test-
negative case control study to determine relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of recombinant inﬂuenza
vaccine (RIV4) compared with standard dose vaccines (SD-IIV4) against inﬂuenza hospitalization.
Methods: Adults 18–64 and 65 years of age hospitalized in a large U.S. health system (19 hospitals) in
2018–2019 and 2019–2020 who were clinically tested for inﬂuenza using reverse transcription poly-
merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were included. The hospital system electronic medical record
EMR) and the state immunization registry were used to conﬁrm inﬂuenza vaccination. Propensity scores
with inverse probability weighting were used to adjust for potential confounders and determine rVE.
Results: Of the 14,590 individuals included in the primary analysis, 3,338 were vaccinated with RIV4 and
976 were vaccinated with SD-IIV4, with the balance of 10,276 being unvaccinated. Most participants

2.1. Patients
Patients were individuals 18 years and older as of August 1 each
season who were hospitalized in one of nineteen UPMC hospitals
in central and southwestern Pennsylvania and had a test for inﬂu-
enza at any time between 11/01/2018 and 04/30/2020. A Ther-
adoc database (an infection control software) was used to
identify those tested for inﬂuenza using reverse transcription poly-
merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays performed in a centralized
clinical lab for some hospitals and individual hospital labs for
others. Inﬂuenza cases were those who tested positive for inﬂu-
enza and controls were those who tested negative for inﬂuenza,
regardless of any other identiﬁed viral infection. Both the EMR
and Pennsylvania Statewide Immunization Information System
(PA-SIIS) were queried for inﬂuenza vaccines given between
August 1 and the date of illness/PCR testing. Exclusion criteria were

This study is a retrospective test-negative case-control study of
inﬂuenza VE against hospitalization using data from electronic
medical records (EMR) of a single large health system to determine
the rVE of RIV4 among adults 18–64 and 65 years of age in the
2018–2019 and 2019–2020 seasons.

Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadriva

Reasonably accurate VE and relative VE (rVE) estimates depend
upon having access to a sufﬁcient number of recipients of any
given vaccine type. Research on high dose quadrivalent inﬂuenza
vaccine (HD-IIV4) has reported rVE for HD-IIV4 compared with
standard dose quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) of 24 %
against laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza [7] and 27 % against inﬂu-
enza hospitalization [8]. Several studies of cell-cultured inﬂuenza
vaccine were conducted prior to the 2019–2020 season (when all
four vaccine strains were cell-cultured) and have not shown signif-
icant rVE against inﬂuenza illness compared with SD-IIV4 [9]. A
large retrospective study of Medicare beneﬁciaries (65 years of
age) in the 2019–2020 season demonstrated no signiﬁcant rVE of
cell-cultured quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (ccIIV4) compared
with SD-IIV4 against inﬂuenza-related hospital encounters [10]
However the study was limited by the fact that there were no

marized across variables. We allow a maximum of three splits for
each tree in the model, allowing for three-way interactions among
all covariates to be considered. The shrinkage parameter was set to
0.0005 to ensure a smooth ﬁt.
We also checked the balance of all the variables included in the
model to assess the quality of the propensity score and evaluate
common support, using a value under 0.25 as indicative of good
balance. We also used the balance plots to compare the propensity
score distributions and to evaluate the common support.
Using the propensity score, we calculated the inverse probabil-
ity of receiving SD-IIV4 weighting. In this approach, for an individ-
ual receiving SD-IIV4 t, the weight equals 1=ptðxÞ , where ptðxÞ is
the propensity score (probability that an individual with character-
istics x receives SD-IIV4 t). A propensity score weighted logistic
regression with inﬂuenza status as the dependent variable was ﬁt-
ted to estimate the effect of vaccine (SD-IIV4 vs. RIV4) on outcome
and also used inverse probability weighting to estimate VE and its
95 % conﬁdence intervals We added covariates like high risk con

Standard Dose Fluzone and FlucelVax. HD-IIV4 was High Dose Flu-
zone, RIV4 was Flublok and Adj-IV was FluAd. Other independent
variables were age, inﬂuenza season (2018–2019 and 2019–
2020), sex, race and presence of one or more high-risk conditions.
Adjusted VE was calculated for RIV4, SD-IIV4 and combined RIV4,
high dose, egg-based and adjuvanted vaccines. Relative VE (rVE)
was calculated as 1 minus the ratio of adjusted VE times 100 %.
We conducted propensity adjustment analyses to reduce the
potential impact of selection effects (i.e., confounding) on baseline
characteristics. We estimated the propensity scores using the Gen-
eralized Boosted Regression Models (GBM) approach, which is a
nonparametric model that allows for nonlinear relationships with
a maximum number of iterations set to the default (i.e.,10,000)
that minimized the balance statistics of interest. We used the bal-
ance statistic based on absolute standardized bias (also referred as
the effect size or absolute standardized mean difference) and sum-

and percentages for categorical data. Baseline characteristics
between the vaccination groups were compared using chi-square
or the Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and ages were
compared by using t-test.
Using adjusted odds ratios (aORs) obtained from multivariable
logistic regression models, adjusted VE estimates were calculated
as (1-aOR) X 100. The dependent variable of interest was inﬂuenza
status. The primary exposure of interest was vaccine type (recom-
binant, SD-IIV4s and in some analyses, enhanced vaccines such as
HD-IIV4 and adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccine (Adj-IV)). The CDC has
recommended the use of ‘‘enhanced vaccines” for adults ages 65
and older beginning in 2022 [13]. Inﬂuenza vaccines were identi-
ﬁed through the EMR; SD-IIV4 included Aﬂuria, Fluarix, FluLaval,

respectively, thus these analyses were likely to be underpowered
to detect a signiﬁcant rVE for RIV4 over SD-IIV4. Moreover, rVE
estimates by vaccine strain were also precluded by insufﬁcient
sample sizes. Descriptions of variables for each group were sum-
marized as mean and standard deviation for age and frequencies

The total number of inﬂuenza test results among inpatients was
18,467 of which 530 were excluded because of missing vaccination
information or vaccination < 14 days before illness, and 3,264 were
excluded from the primary analyses because patients were
immunocompromised or received enhanced vaccines other than
RIV4 (n = 613), leaving 14,590 for the primary analysis (Fig. 1).
Of these, 3,338 were vaccinated with RIV4 and 976 were vacci-
nated with SD-IIV4, with the balance of 10,276 being unvaccinated.
For the secondary analyses, the analyzable cohort included the 613
HD-IIV4 and Adj-IV recipients bringing the total analyzable sample
to 15,203 (Fig. 2). The inﬂuenza positivity rate was 12.4 %

Among older adults, receipt of RIV4 was signiﬁcantly associated

5. Conclusions


### wave precedes the inﬂuenza
circulation of A(H3N2) ma

ond, as an integrated healthcare system, its EMR is robust, with
regular uploads of vaccination data from the state immunization
registry. In addition, we veriﬁed vaccination status through the
state registry with a speciﬁc data request. In previous research,
we have demonstrated that registry data are a reasonable source
for inﬂuenza vaccination data [18]. As a result, we have conﬁdence
that inﬂuenza vaccinations are captured accurately in the EMR. If
vaccinations were not captured in the EMR or state registry, they
were classiﬁed as unvaccinated. While this classiﬁcation would
likely introduce bias into VE estimates [16], it would likely not bias
rVE estimates, as there is no reason to believe that any vaccine is
preferentially included or excluded from reporting to the state reg-
istry. This study excluded subjects with immunosuppressive con-
ditions or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy whose
response to vaccines is limited. Because data focused on hospital-
ized patients, there may have been milder cases that did not
require medical care and were not captured in the EMR, thus did
not contribute to these estimates. Adding measures of severity of
illness into the model would improve the accuracy of the VE esti-
mates, however, these measures were not available. The differ-
ences
in
severity
are
likely
narrower
given
that
all
were
sufﬁciently ill to require hospitalization, thus mitigating the need
for such an adjustment. It is possible that there may have been
selection bias among those who received inﬂuenza virus testing,
for example, clinicians may preferentially test those who are
unvaccinated against inﬂuenza thus increasing the proportion of
unvaccinated cases. Based on a previous study among patients in
this health system that found no increase in testing based on vac-
cination status [19], we feel conﬁdent that this is not a concern.
While a relatively large cohort of adults is included in this study,
the sample size of SD-IIV4 recipients may have been inadequate
to detect meaningful rVE estimates for speciﬁc subgroups.
These data should be viewed in the context of the seasons for
which data were collected. These seasons were ‘‘typical” in that
inﬂuenza began to increase in November, peaking in January and
February both seasons, and numbers of inﬂuenza-related deaths
were 28,000 in 2018–2019 and 25,000 in 2019–2020. These sea-
sons were atypical in that virtually no inﬂuenza B circulated in
2018–2019 but there were both A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) peaks
and in 2019–2020, inﬂuenza B circulated early followed by A
(H1N1) in contrast to typical seasons in which the inﬂuenza A

4.1. Strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths and limitations. Firstly, the
demographics of the study population were similar to those of
the Allegheny County general population of adults in which 79 %
are white and 51 % are female [17], thus contributing to generaliz-
ability. Moreover, the health system includes urban tertiary and
quaternary care hospitals as well as suburban and rural commu-
nity hospitals. It has a 60 % market share of all hospital beds in
the county and accepts patients with all insurance products. Sec-
