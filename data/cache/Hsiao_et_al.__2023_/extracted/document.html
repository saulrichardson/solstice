<div class="text">stantial public health benefit, especially during <br>more severe influenza seasons.<br>Several studies have shown benefit for the <br>recombinant vaccine and other high-dose influ-<br>enza vaccines as compared with standard-dose <br>vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or <br>older, findings that have been attributed to an <br>improved immune response.5,14-17 In the current <br>study, we compared the effectiveness of the <br>high-dose recombinant vaccine with that of <br>standard-dose vaccines in patients between the <br>ages of 18 and 64 years. The effectiveness of <br>standard-dose vaccines — especially against the <br>influenza A H3N2 subtype — may be attenuated <br>by antigenic drift during egg-based manufactur-<br>ing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not <br>susceptible to such drift. However, data from the <br>California Department of Public Health showed <br>that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the <br>second half of the 2018–2019 season,18 and even <br>then, the circulating strain had drifted such that <br>it was poorly matched to both the recombinant <br>vaccine and the standard-dose vaccines.19,20 Dur-<br>ing our study period, the observed benefit of the <br>recombinant vaccine as compared with a stan-<br>dard-dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher <br>relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than <br>to higher effectiveness against influenza A over-</div>

<div class="text">in our real-world setting, compliance with the<br>weekly assigned vaccine schedule occasionally<br>varied because of logistic constraints, including<br>supply-chain issues for the recombinant vaccine,<br>which led to different numbers of participants in<br>the two groups. Second, our data were limited to<br>two influenza seasons; relative vaccine effective-<br>ness may vary across seasons, depending on the<br>vaccine match with circulating strains. Third,<br>our primary outcome did not include infections<br>in persons who did not undergo PCR testing,<br>which limits its generalizability. Fourth, the study<br>had limited power to detect a clinically mean-<br>ingful benefit of the recombinant vaccine as<br>compared with a standard-dose vaccine with<br>respect to less frequent outcomes, such as hos-<br>pitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza.
