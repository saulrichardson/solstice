<div class="title">Recombinant or Standard-Dose Influenza 
Vaccine in Adults under 65 Years of Age</div>
<div class="text">Amber Hsiao, Ph.D., M.P.H., Arnold Yee, M.B.A., Bruce Fireman, M.A., <br>John Hansen, M.P.H., Ned Lewis, M.P.H., and Nicola P. Klein, M.D., Ph.D.​</div>
<div class="title">BACKGROUND</div>
<div class="text">Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of <br>hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines, and the recombinant <br>formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. Data are <br>needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with <br>standard-dose vaccines against influenza-related outcomes in adults under the age <br>of 65 years.</div>
<div class="text">In this cluster-randomized observational study, Kaiser Permanente Northern Cali-<br>fornia facilities routinely administered either a high-dose recombinant influenza <br>vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) or one of two standard-dose influenza vaccines <br>during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons to adults 50 to 64 years <br>of age (primary age group) and 18 to 49 years of age. Each facility alternated <br>weekly between the two vaccine formulations. The primary outcome was influ-<br>enza (A or B) confirmed by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing. Secondary <br>outcomes included influenza A, influenza B, and influenza-related hospitalization <br>outcomes. We used Cox regression analysis to estimate the hazard ratio of the <br>recombinant vaccine as compared with the standard-dose vaccines against each <br>outcome. We calculated the relative vaccine effectiveness as 1 minus the hazard <br>ratio.</div>
<div class="title">RESULTS</div>
<div class="text">The study population included 1,630,328 vaccinees between the ages of 18 and 64 <br>years (632,962 in the recombinant-vaccine group and 997,366 in the standard-dose <br>group). During this study period, 1386 cases of PCR-confirmed influenza were <br>diagnosed in the recombinant-vaccine group and 2435 cases in the standard-dose <br>group. Among the participants who were 50 to 64 years of age, 559 participants <br>(2.00 cases per 1000) tested positive for influenza in the recombinant-vaccine <br>group as compared with 925 participants (2.34 cases per 1000) in the standard-<br>dose group (relative vaccine effectiveness, 15.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9 <br>to 23.8; P = 0.002). In the same age group, the relative vaccine effectiveness against <br>influenza A was 15.7% (95% CI, 6.0 to 24.5; P = 0.002). The recombinant vaccine <br>was not significantly more protective against influenza-related hospitalization <br>than were the standard-dose vaccines.</div>
<div class="title">CONCLUSIONS</div>
<div class="text">The high-dose recombinant vaccine conferred more protection against PCR-con-<br>firmed influenza than an egg-based standard-dose vaccine among adults between <br>the ages of 50 and 64 years. (Funded by Sanofi; ClinicalTrials.gov number, <br>NCT03694392.)</div>

<div class="text">E<br>very year in the United States, in-<br>fluenza causes mild-to-severe illness in a <br>wide range of persons (9 million to 41 <br>million).1 Influenza vaccination is the primary <br>method for preventing influenza-related illness-<br>es,2 although the vaccine effectiveness ranges <br>from 20% in years in which the vaccine is anti-<br>genically mismatched to the circulating viral <br>strain to 40 to 60% in years in which the vaccine <br>is antigenically well matched.2,3 This large varia-<br>tion in effectiveness between years suggests that <br>more effective vaccines are needed.</div>
<div class="text">In traditional quadrivalent standard-dose in-<br>activated influenza vaccines (SD-IIV4), chicken<br>eggs are used to manufacture the influenza<br>virus. Mutations in the hemagglutinin protein<br>during egg-based manufacturing can result in<br>mismatch between the selected strain and the<br>vaccine strain.4 The Flublok Quadrivalent influ-<br>enza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured<br>without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant<br>hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identi-<br>cal to that in the selected strain.5 The vaccine<br>also contains three times the amount of hemag-<br>glutinin protein as standard-dose vaccines, an<br>increased level that has been correlated with<br>increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.6<br>To estimate the relative effectiveness of the<br>recombinant vaccine as compared with standard-<br>dose vaccines against laboratory-confirmed in-<br>fluenza and influenza-related outcomes, we com-<br>pared the two formulations of vaccines among<br>members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern<br>California (KPNC) health care system who were<br>between 18 and 64 years of age during the two<br>influenza seasons of 2018–2019 and 2019–2020.</div>
<div class="title">Study Population and Oversight</div>
<div class="text">KPNC is an integrated health care delivery sys-<br>tem with 4.6 million members, nearly 65% of<br>whom are adults between the ages of 18 and 64<br>years. Members receive nearly all their care at<br>system-owned facilities, which includes 259<br>medical clinics and 21 hospitals. The members’<br>electronic medical records capture all medical<br>services, including inpatient and outpatient di-<br>agnoses, laboratory tests, and vaccinations. The<br>KPNC members include approximately a third<br>of the population in Northern California and</div>

The <br>Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine was <br>donated by Sanofi, and the two standard-dose <br>vaccines used during the study seasons were <br>purchased by KPNC. The first author wrote the <br>first draft of the manuscript. The authors vouch <br>for the accuracy and completeness of the data <br>presented and for the fidelity of the study to the <br>protocol (available at NEJM.org).</div>
<div class="title">Study Design</div>
<div class="text">This was a cluster-randomized observationa<br>study that was designed to include all KPNC<br>members between the ages of 18 and 64 years<br>who had received a licensed recombinant or<br>standard-dose vaccine as part of routine clinica<br>care during the three influenza seasons from<br>2018 to 2021.9 The 2019–2020 season was trun-<br>cated in March 2020 because of the outbreak of<br>the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; data<br>from the 2020–2021 season were subsequently<br>excluded from the analyses because there were<br>too few cases of influenza during the pandemic<br>to be informative. During the study period, influ-<br>enza vaccination coverage was similar to nationa<br>coverage (Table S1). The study excluded unvac-<br>cinated patients.</div>
<div class="text">The KPNC system includes seven geographic<br>regions, each containing 8 to 12 medical facili-<br>ties. In each region, the facilities were assigned<br>to either Block A or Block B to optimize the bal-<br>ance between blocks with respect to facility size<br>(Fig. 1). We randomly assigned Block A to start<br>with administration of a standard-dose vaccine<br>and Block B to start with administration of the<br>recombinant vaccine. Thereafter, each facility<br>alternated the administration of the two vac-<br>cines weekly.<br>Key features of the study design were that</div>

<div class="text">the weeks when influenza was circulating. Pa-<br>tients were unaware of which vaccine was avail-<br>able at any facility. During the study period, the <br>facilities administered primarily high-dose vac-<br>cines to adults who were 65 years of age or <br>older, which made it infeasible to include those <br>members in the study randomization.</div>
<div class="title">Outcomes</div>
<div class="text">The primary outcome was influenza as con-<br>firmed by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test-<br>ing (Cepheid GeneXpert PCR assay, a test that <br>also identifies respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]). <br>Physicians at each facility ordered influenza PCR <br>tests at their discretion on the basis of clinical <br>presentation; rapid influenza antigen testing was <br>not performed.<br>Secondary outcomes were PCR-confirmed in-<br>fluenza A, PCR-confirmed influenza B, and hos-<br>pitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, for <br>community-acquired pneumonia, and for cardio-<br>respiratory events including community-acquired <br>pneumonia. We identified community-acquired <br>pneumonia and other cardiorespiratory events <br>using primary discharge diagnosis codes as listed <br>in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th <br>Revision (ICD-10) (Table S2).<br>Exploratory outcomes were an influenza diag-<br>nosis (PCR-confirmed or clinically diagnosed <br>influenza on the basis of ICD-10 codes), nonelec-<br>tive hospitalization for any cause, and death <br>from any cause. For each outcome except death <br>from any cause, we counted only the first event <br>during each season that occurred more than 14 <br>days after vaccination. All deaths after vaccina-<br>tion within the study period were considered to <br>be a safety outcome and were counted even if they <br>had occurred within 14 days after vaccination.</div>
<div class="title">Objectives</div>
<div class="text">The primary objective was to estimate the rela-<br>tive vaccine effectiveness of the recombinant vac-<br>cine as compared with a standard-dose vaccine<br>against PCR-confirmed influenza in patients be-<br>tween the ages of 50 and 64 years, the primary<br>age group (Table S3). The secondary objectives<br>were to estimate the relative vaccine effective-<br>ness of the recombinant vaccine against second-<br>ary outcomes in patients in the primary age<br>group and against secondary outcomes in five<br>prespecified subgroups of patients with preex-</div>
<div class="title">n engl j med 389;24  nejm.org  December 14, 2023</div>
<div class="text">isting conditions (cardiovascular disease, respi-<br>ratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity,<br>and diabetes) in the primary age group. Other<br>estimates of relative vaccine effectiveness were<br>considered to be exploratory.</div>
<div class="title">Statistical Analysis</div>
<div class="text">We tested the null hypotheses that the recombi-<br>nant vaccine would not be any more or any less<br>effective than a standard-dose vaccine against<br>influenza, using a two-sided test with a P value<br>of less than 0.05 indicating statistical signifi-<br>cance. We estimated that the administration of<br>400,000 doses each of the two vaccine formula-<br>tions to patients between the ages of 18 and 64<br>years each influenza season would provide the<br>study with 86% power to detect a relative vaccine<br>effectiveness of 10.0% against PCR-confirmed<br>influenza. On the basis of previous data, we es-<br>timated the occurrence of 2.18 PCR-confirmed<br>influenza cases per 1000 participants in the<br>standard-dose group.<br>We used Cox regression analysis to estimate<br>the adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence<br>intervals for the recombinant vaccine as com-<br>pared with a standard-dose vaccine for each<br>outcome. The model specified a calendar time<br>scale and included adjustments for sex, race or<br>ethnic group, and age and an age-squared factor<br>(in case age and risk had either a linear or cur-<br>vilinear association). Risk sets were formed on<br>each date on which at least one outcome event<br>occurred in either study group. Each risk set<br>contained every participant in follow-up on that<br>calendar date. Most of the participants had been<br>vaccinated before the beginning of the influenza<br>season and were included in every risk set<br>throughout the season.</div>
<div class="text">g<br>The Cox model also used stabilized weights<br>that were based on propensity scores. The statis-<br>tical analysis plan prespecified the use of pro-<br>pensity scores if imbalances were found in any<br>study variables. We observed modest imbalances<br>at some facilities in one or both seasons, although<br>not overall (Tables S4 and S5). Thus, we created<br>propensity scores that were specific for each fa-<br>cility and season. The propensity scores were<br>derived by logistic regression to estimate the<br>probability of the receipt of a recombinant vac-<br>cine rather than a standard-dose vaccine with<br>respect to sex, race, age, coexisting illnesses,</div>

<div class="text">indicators of health care–seeking behavior (e.g., <br>previous influenza vaccination), 2-month inter-<br>vals of calendar time, and other factors. Missing <br>data were not imputed.<br>The relative vaccine effectiveness was based <br>on the hazard ratio (1 minus the hazard ratio, <br>expressed as a percentage). This calculation es-<br>timated the percent reduction in the incidence of <br>the outcome in the recombinant-vaccine group <br>as compared with that in the standard-dose <br>group. The proportional-hazards assumption of <br>the Cox regression was evaluated, and no viola-<br>tion was found (Fig. S1).</div>
<div class="text">ments of the recombinant vaccine occasionally <br>left some clinics temporarily without enough <br>recombinant vaccine to comply with the week-<br>ly schedule, so standard-dose vaccines were <br>then administered to prevent interruptions in <br>patient care.<br>Among the 675,252 patients between 50 and <br>64 years of age, 279,400 (41.4%) received the <br>recombinant vaccine and 395,852 (58.6%) re-<br>ceived a standard-dose vaccine (Table 1). Among <br>the 955,076 patients between 18 and 49 years of <br>age, 353,562 (37.0%) received the recombinant <br>vaccine and 601,514 (63.0%) received a standard-<br>dose vaccine (Table S6).<br>Of the 16,340 influenza PCR tests performed <br>in the study population, 3821 (23.4%) were in-<br>fluenza positive. Of the PCR-confirmed influ-<br>enza cases, 1484 (38.8%) were diagnosed in pa-<br>tients between the ages of 50 and 64 years and <br>2337 (61.2%) in patients between the ages of 18 <br>and 49 years. Among the participants with PCR-<br>confirmed influenza, hospitalization occurred <br>in 248 of 1484 participants (16.7%) among those <br>between the ages of 50 and 64 years and in 136 <br>of 2337 (5.8%) of those between the ages of 18 <br>and 49 years.<br>The demographic characteristics of the par-<br>ticipants at baseline were similar in the two vac-<br>cine groups and in the two age groups (Table 1 <br>and Table S6). There was some variation in the <br>timing of the administration of the two vaccines <br>according to geographic region, although during <br>the two influenza seasons, most vaccinations <br>in the two groups had occurred by mid-to-late <br>November (Tables S4 and S5).</div>
<div class="text">For secondary objectives in participants be-<br>tween the ages of 50 and 64 years, we adjusted <br>for multiplicity by Holm’s method.10 Subgroup <br>analyses involving participants with preexisting <br>conditions were not adjusted for multiplicity. We <br>conducted sensitivity analyses in which we used <br>propensity scores in alternative ways, used a robust <br>variance estimator, stratified risk sets according <br>to facility and vaccination week, and specified <br>age as a spline (see the Supplementary Methods <br>section).<br>To assess possible residual confounding, we <br>examined PCR-confirmed RSV infection as a <br>negative control outcome because we would not <br>expect influenza vaccination to be associated with <br>a reduction in this infection. A nontrivial asso-<br>ciation between receipt of the recombinant vac-<br>cine and RSV infection would suggest bias in <br>our estimate of the relative vaccine effectiveness <br>against influenza. Conversely, a finding of no <br>association between receipt of the recombinant <br>vaccine and RSV infection would be reassuring <br>that our estimates of relative vaccine effective-<br>ness were not biased by unmeasured factors that <br>might affect the risk of both laboratory-con-<br>firmed RSV infection and influenza. All data <br>analyses were performed with the use of SAS <br>software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).</div>

<div class="text">Shown is a forest plot of the relative effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard-dose <br>vaccine against influenza as confirmed by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed <br>nfluenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia among study participants in the older age group<br>according to the presence of five prespecified preexisting conditions.</div>

Our analyses of the three additional <br>econdary outcomes in this age group suggested <br>hat the recombinant vaccine may confer more <br>rotection than standard-dose vaccines against <br>ospitalization outcomes. Although these find-<br>ngs were not significant, a post hoc analysis <br>ombining hospitalization for PCR-confirmed <br>nfluenza and hospitalization for community-<br>cquired pneumonia yielded a relative vaccine <br>ffectiveness of 19.7% (95% CI, 2.8 to 33.7).<br>The 12 exploratory analyses yielded some-<br>hat inconsistent results. For influenza diagno-<br>es overall (including unconfirmed diagnoses) <br>mong patients between the ages of 18 and 49 <br>ears, the incidence was lower in the recombi-<br>nant-vaccine group than in the standard-dose<br>group (relative vaccine effectiveness, 10.8%; 95%<br>CI, 6.6 to 14.7).

<div class="text">If standard-dose vaccines were already pre-<br>venting most cases of influenza and break-<br>through cases were uncommon, preventing 15% <br>of breakthrough cases would be of modest pub-<br>lic health benefit. However, since standard-dose <br>vaccines prevent at most 40 to 60% of influenza <br>cases annually,13 reducing the incidence of break-<br>through influenza by 15% would provide a sub-<br>stantial public health benefit, especially during <br>more severe influenza seasons.<br>Several studies have shown benefit for the <br>recombinant vaccine and other high-dose influ-<br>enza vaccines as compared with standard-dose <br>vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or <br>older, findings that have been attributed to an <br>improved immune response.5,14-17 In the current <br>study, we compared the effectiveness of the <br>high-dose recombinant vaccine with that of <br>standard-dose vaccines in patients between the <br>ages of 18 and 64 years. The effectiveness of <br>standard-dose vaccines — especially against the <br>influenza A H3N2 subtype — may be attenuated <br>by antigenic drift during egg-based manufactur-<br>ing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not <br>susceptible to such drift. However, data from the <br>California Department of Public Health showed <br>that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the <br>second half of the 2018–2019 season,18 and even <br>then, the circulating strain had drifted such that <br>it was poorly matched to both the recombinant <br>vaccine and the standard-dose vaccines.19,20 Dur-<br>ing our study period, the observed benefit of the <br>recombinant vaccine as compared with a stan-<br>dard-dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher <br>relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than <br>to higher effectiveness against influenza A over-<br>all associated with its higher dose of hemagglu-<br>tinin antigen.<br>A strength of our study is that the two study <br>vaccine formulations were alternated in weekly <br>intervals of time at each facility, which allowed <br>us to balance covariates of interest as designed. <br>In every KPNC geographic area, when influenza <br>arrived, there were already participants who had <br>received one of the two formulations of vaccine <br>and who were similar with respect to demo-<br>graphic characteristics, coexisting illnesses,</div>

<div class="text">health care–seeking behavior, and the number <br>of weeks since vaccination. To our knowledge, <br>this design has not been previously used, and its <br>handling of potential confounding bias has not <br>been formally studied. Our intent was to mini-<br>mize imbalances between the participants who <br>received each vaccine, both within and between <br>facilities. We also included several sensitivity <br>analyses to address potential biases from clus-<br>tering according to facility. Sensitivity analyses <br>that were stratified either according to facility <br>(to compare within facilities) or according to <br>week (to compare between facilities) showed a <br>relative vaccine effectiveness of approximately <br>15%, similar to the findings of our primary <br>analysis.<br>Our study also has several limitations. First, <br>in our real-world setting, compliance with the <br>weekly assigned vaccine schedule occasionally <br>varied because of logistic constraints, including <br>supply-chain issues for the recombinant vaccine, <br>which led to different numbers of participants in <br>the two groups. Second, our data were limited to <br>two influenza seasons; relative vaccine effective-<br>ness may vary across seasons, depending on the <br>vaccine match with circulating strains. Third, <br>our primary outcome did not include infections <br>in persons who did not undergo PCR testing, <br>which limits its generalizability. Fourth, the study <br>had limited power to detect a clinically mean-<br>ingful benefit of the recombinant vaccine as <br>compared with a standard-dose vaccine with <br>respect to less frequent outcomes, such as hos-<br>pitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza. Finally, <br>although KPNC has a diverse population, it may <br>not be representative of other populations in the <br>United States.</div>
