METHODS
In this cluster-randomized observational study, Kaiser Permanente Northern Cali-
fornia facilities routinely administered either a high-dose recombinant influenza 
vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) or one of two standard-dose influenza vaccines 
during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons to adults 50 to 64 years 
of age (primary age group) and 18 to 49 years of age. Each facility alternated 
weekly between the two vaccine formulations. The primary outcome was influ-
enza (A or B) confirmed by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing. Secondary 
outcomes included influenza A, influenza B, and influenza-related hospitalization 
outcomes. We used Cox regression analysis to estimate the hazard ratio of the 
recombinant vaccine as compared with the standard-dose vaccines against each 
outcome. We calculated the relative vaccine effectiveness as 1 minus the hazard

BACKGROUND
Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of
hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines, and the recombinant
formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. Data are
needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with
standard dose vaccines against influenza related outcomes in adults under the age

whom are adults between the ages of 18 and 64 
years. Members receive nearly all their care at 
system-owned facilities, which includes 259 
medical clinics and 21 hospitals. The members’ 
electronic medical records capture all medical 
services, including inpatient and outpatient di-
agnoses, laboratory tests, and vaccinations. The 
KPNC members include approximately a third 
of the population in Northern California and

increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.
To estimate the relative effectiveness of the 
recombinant vaccine as compared with standard-
dose vaccines against laboratory-confirmed in-
fluenza and influenza-related outcomes, we com-
pared the two formulations of vaccines among 
members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern 
California (KPNC) health care system who were 
between 18 and 64 years of age during the two 
influenza seasons of 2018–2019 and 2019–2020.
Methods
Study Population and Oversight
KPNC is an integrated health care delivery sys-
tem with 4.6 million members, nearly 65% of

vaccine strain.4 The Flublok Quadrivalent influ-
enza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured 
without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant 
hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identi-
cal to that in the selected strain.5 The vaccine 
also contains three times the amount of hemag-
glutinin protein as standard-dose vaccines, an 
increased level that has been correlated with

method for preventing influenza-related illness-
es,2 although the vaccine effectiveness ranges
from 20% in years in which the vaccine is anti-
genically mismatched to the circulating viral
strain to 40 to 60% in years in which the vaccine
is antigenically well matched.2,3 This large varia-
tion in effectiveness between years suggests that
more effective vaccines are needed.
In traditional quadrivalent standard-dose in-
activated influenza vaccines (SD-IIV4), chicken

The KPNC system includes seven geographic
regions, each containing 8 to 12 medical facili-

Study Design
This was a cluster-randomized observationa
study that was designed to include all KPNC
members between the ages of 18 and 64 years
who had received a licensed recombinant or
standard-dose vaccine as part of routine clinica
care during the three influenza seasons from
2018 to 2021.9 The 2019–2020 season was trun-
cated in March 2020 because of the outbreak of

in other U.S. regions (Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix, available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org).7 Approximately 10% 
of the members are covered by Medicaid.8 The 
KPNC institutional review board approved the 
study with a waiver of informed consent.
Representatives of the study sponsor, Sanofi, 
did not have a role in the design or conduct of 
the study or in the analyses of the data. The 
Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine was 
donated by Sanofi, and the two standard-dose

Objectives
The primary objective was to estimate the rela-
tive vaccine effectiveness of the recombinant vac-
cine as compared with a standard-dose vaccine 
against PCR-confirmed influenza in patients be-
tween the ages of 50 and 64 years, the primary

Exploratory outcomes were an influenza diag-
nosis (PCR-confirmed or clinically diagnosed
influenza on the basis of ICD-10 codes), nonelec-
tive hospitalization for any cause, and death
from any cause. For each outcome except death
from any cause, we counted only the first event
during each season that occurred more than 14
days after vaccination. All deaths after vaccina-
tion within the study period were considered to
be a safety outcome and were counted even if they

not performed.
Secondary outcomes were PCR-confirmed in-
fluenza A, PCR-confirmed influenza B, and hos-
pitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, for 
community-acquired pneumonia, and for cardio-
respiratory events including community-acquired 
pneumonia. We identified community-acquired 
pneumonia and other cardiorespiratory events 
using primary discharge diagnosis codes as listed 
in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision (ICD-10) (Table S2).

contained every participant in follow-up on that
calendar date. Most of the participants had been
vaccinated before the beginning of the influenza
season and were included in every risk set
throughout the season.
The Cox model also used stabilized weights
that were based on propensity scores. The statis-
tical analysis plan prespecified the use of pro-
pensity scores if imbalances were found in any
study variables. We observed modest imbalances
at some facilities in one or both seasons, although
not overall (Tables S4 and S5). Thus, we created
propensity scores that were specific for each fa-
cility and season. The propensity scores were

effectiveness of 10.0% against PCR-confirmed
influenza. On the basis of previous data, we es-
timated the occurrence of 2.18 PCR-confirmed
influenza cases per 1000 participants in the
standard-dose group.
We used Cox regression analysis to estimate
the adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence
intervals for the recombinant vaccine as com-
pared with a standard-dose vaccine for each
outcome. The model specified a calendar time
scale and included adjustments for sex, race or
ethnic group, and age and an age-squared factor
(in case age and risk had either a linear or cur-
vilinear association). Risk sets were formed on
each date on which at least one outcome event

Statistical Analysis
We tested the null hypotheses that the recombi-
nant vaccine would not be any more or any less
effective than a standard-dose vaccine against
influenza, using a two-sided test with a P value
of less than 0.05 indicating statistical signifi-
cance. We estimated that the administration of
400,000 doses each of the two vaccine formula-
tions to patients between the ages of 18 and 64

Study Participants
The study population included 1,630,328 partici-
pants during influenza seasons in 2018–2019 and 
2019–2020. Of these participants, 632,962 (38.8%) 
received the recombinant vaccine and 997,366 
(61.2%) received a standard-dose vaccine (Fig. 2

compared with 925 (2.34 per 1000) in the stan-
dard-dose group (Table 2). For the primary ob-
jective, the relative vaccine effectiveness of the
recombinant vaccine as compared with standard-
dose vaccines against all PCR-confirmed influ-
enza was 15.3% (95% CI, 5.9 to 23.8; P = 0.002).
The estimate of relative vaccine effectiveness
for the secondary objective of PCR-confirmed

cine and RSV infection would suggest bias in 
our estimate of the relative vaccine effectiveness 
against influenza. Conversely, a finding of no 
association between receipt of the recombinant 
vaccine and RSV infection would be reassuring 
that our estimates of relative vaccine effective-
ness were not biased by unmeasured factors that 
might affect the risk of both laboratory-con-
firmed RSV infection and influenza. All data 
analyses were performed with the use of SAS 
software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

and Table S6). There was some variation in the 
timing of the administration of the two vaccines 
according to geographic region, although during 
the two influenza seasons, most vaccinations 
in the two groups had occurred by mid-to-late 
November (Tables S4 and S5).
Primary and Secondary Analyses
In patients between the ages of 50 and 64 years, 
559 (2.00 cases per 1000) tested positive for in-
fluenza in the recombinant-vaccine group as

For secondary objectives in participants be-
tween the ages of 50 and 64 years, we adjusted 
for multiplicity by Holm’s method.10 Subgroup 
analyses involving participants with preexisting 
conditions were not adjusted for multiplicity. We 
conducted sensitivity analyses in which we used 
propensity scores in alternative ways, used a robust 
variance estimator, stratified risk sets according 
to facility and vaccination week, and specified 
age as a spline (see the Supplementary Methods 
section).
To assess possible residual confounding, we 
examined PCR-confirmed RSV infection as a 
negative control outcome because we would not 
expect influenza vaccination to be associated with 
a reduction in this infection. A nontrivial asso-

A strength of our study is that the two study 
vaccine formulations were alternated in weekly 
intervals of time at each facility, which allowed 
us to balance covariates of interest as designed. 
In every KPNC geographic area, when influenza 
arrived, there were already participants who had 
received one of the two formulations of vaccine 
and who were similar with respect to demo-

stantial public health benefit, especially during 
more severe influenza seasons.
Several studies have shown benefit for the 
recombinant vaccine and other high-dose influ-
enza vaccines as compared with standard-dose 
vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or 
older, findings that have been attributed to an 
improved immune response.5,14-17 In the current 
study, we compared the effectiveness of the 
high-dose recombinant vaccine with that of 
standard-dose vaccines in patients between the 
ages of 18 and 64 years. The effectiveness of 
standard-dose vaccines — especially against the 
influenza A H3N2 subtype — may be attenuated 
by antigenic drift during egg-based manufactur-
ing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not 
susceptible to such drift. However, data from the 
California Department of Public Health showed 
that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the 
second half of the 2018–2019 season,18 and even 
then, the circulating strain had drifted such that 
it was poorly matched to both the recombinant 
vaccine and the standard-dose vaccines.19,20 Dur-
ing our study period, the observed benefit of the 
recombinant vaccine as compared with a stan-
dard-dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher 
relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than 
to higher effectiveness against influenza A over-

y
age group.11,12
If standard-dose vaccines were already pre-
venting most cases of influenza and break-
through cases were uncommon, preventing 15%
of breakthrough cases would be of modest pub-
lic health benefit. However, since standard-dose
vaccines prevent at most 40 to 60% of influenza
cases annually,13 reducing the incidence of break-
through influenza by 15% would provide a sub-

had more protection against confirmed influenza 
than those who received a standard-dose vaccine.

We thank many groups within Kaiser Permanente Northern

in our real-world setting, compliance with the
weekly assigned vaccine schedule occasionally
varied because of logistic constraints, including
supply-chain issues for the recombinant vaccine,
which led to different numbers of participants in
the two groups. Second, our data were limited to
two influenza seasons; relative vaccine effective-
ness may vary across seasons, depending on the
vaccine match with circulating strains. Third,
our primary outcome did not include infections
in persons who did not undergo PCR testing,
which limits its generalizability. Fourth, the study
had limited power to detect a clinically mean-
ingful benefit of the recombinant vaccine as
compared with a standard-dose vaccine with
respect to less frequent outcomes, such as hos-
pitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza. Finally,
although KPNC has a diverse population, it may
not be representative of other populations in the
United States.
