However, since standard-dose \nvaccines prevent at most 40 to 60% of influenza \ncases annually,13 reducing the incidence of break-\nthrough influenza by 15% would provide a sub-\nstantial public health benefit, especially during \nmore severe influenza seasons.\nSeveral studies have shown benefit for the \nrecombinant vaccine and other high-dose influ-\nenza vaccines as compared with standard-dose \nvaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or \nolder, findings that have been attributed to an \nimproved immune response.5,14-17 In the current \nstudy, we compared the effectiveness of the \nhigh-dose recombinant vaccine with that of \nstandard-dose vaccines in patients between the \nages of 18 and 64 years. The effectiveness of \nstandard-dose vaccines — especially against the \ninfluenza A H3N2 subtype — may be attenuated \nby antigenic drift during egg-based manufactur-\ning, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not \nsusceptible to such drift. However, data from the \nCalifornia Department of Public Health showed \nthat the H3N2 strain circulated only during the \nsecond half of the 2018–2019 season,18 and even \nthen, the circulating strain had drifted such that \nit was poorly matched to both the recombinant \nvaccine and the standard-dose vaccines.19,20 Dur-\ning our study period, the observed benefit of the \nrecombinant vaccine as compared with a stan-\ndard-dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher \nrelative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than \nto higher effectiveness against influenza A over-\nall associated with its higher dose of hemagglu-\ntinin antigen.\nA strength of our study is that the two study \nvaccine formulations were alternated in weekly \nintervals of time at each facility, which allowed \nus to balance covariates of interest as designed. \nIn every KPNC geographic area, when influenza \narrived, there were already participants who had \nreceived one of the two formulations of vaccine \nand who were similar with respect to demo-\ngraphic characteristics, coexisting illnesses,",
