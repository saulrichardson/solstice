Second, our data were limited to \ntwo influenza seasons; relative vaccine effective-\nness may vary across seasons, depending on the \nvaccine match with circulating strains. Third, \nour primary outcome did not include infections \nin persons who did not undergo PCR testing, \nwhich limits its generalizability. Fourth, the study \nhad limited power to detect a clinically mean-\ningful benefit of the recombinant vaccine as \ncompared with a standard-dose vaccine with \nrespect to less frequent outcomes, such as hos-\npitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza. Finally, \nalthough KPNC has a diverse population, it may \nnot be representative of other populations in the \nUnited States.\nIn this study performed during two influenza",
