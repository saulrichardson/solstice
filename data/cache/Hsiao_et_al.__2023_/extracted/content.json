Several studies have shown benefit for the recombinant vaccine and other high dose in flu enza vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or older, findings that have been attributed to an improved immune response 5 14 17 In the current study, we compared the effectiveness of the high dose recombinant vaccine with that of standard dose vaccines in patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years. The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines — especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype — may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufactur- ing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season 18 and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines 19 20 Dur- ing our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a stan- dard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A over-",

Third, our primary outcome did not include infections in persons who did not undergo PCR testing, which limits its generalizability.
