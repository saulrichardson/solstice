The effectiveness of \nstandard-dose vaccines — especially against the \ninfluenza A H3N2 subtype — may be attenuated \nby antigenic drift during egg-based manufactur-\ning, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not \nsusceptible to such drift. However, data from the \nCalifornia Department of Public Health showed \nthat the H3N2 strain circulated only during the \nsecond half of the 2018–2019 season,18 and even \nthen, the circulating strain had drifted such that \nit was poorly matched to both the recombinant \nvaccine and the standard-dose vaccines.19,20 Dur-\ning our study period, the observed benefit of the \nrecombinant vaccine as compared with a stan-\ndard-dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher \nrelative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than \nto higher effectiveness against influenza A over-",
