### BACKGROUND

Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of 
hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines, and the recombinant 
formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. Data are 
needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with 
standard-dose vaccines against influenza-related outcomes in adults under the age 
of 65 years.

In this cluster-randomized observational study, Kaiser Permanente Northern Cali-
fornia facilities routinely administered either a high-dose recombinant influenza 
vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) or one of two standard-dose influenza vaccines 
during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons to adults 50 to 64 years 
of age (primary age group) and 18 to 49 years of age. Each facility alternated 
weekly between the two vaccine formulations. The primary outcome was influ-
enza (A or B) confirmed by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing. Secondary 
outcomes included influenza A, influenza B, and influenza-related hospitalization 
outcomes. We used Cox regression analysis to estimate the hazard ratio of the 
recombinant vaccine as compared with the standard-dose vaccines against each 
outcome. We calculated the relative vaccine effectiveness as 1 minus the hazard 
ratio.


### RESULTS

The study population included 1,630,328 vaccinees between the ages of 18 and 64 
years (632,962 in the recombinant-vaccine group and 997,366 in the standard-dose 
group). During this study period, 1386 cases of PCR-confirmed influenza were 
diagnosed in the recombinant-vaccine group and 2435 cases in the standard-dose 
group. Among the participants who were 50 to 64 years of age, 559 participants 
(2.00 cases per 1000) tested positive for influenza in the recombinant-vaccine 
group as compared with 925 participants (2.34 cases per 1000) in the standard-
dose group (relative vaccine effectiveness, 15.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9 
to 23.8; P = 0.002). In the same age group, the relative vaccine effectiveness against 
influenza A was 15.7% (95% CI, 6.0 to 24.5; P = 0.002). The recombinant vaccine 
was not significantly more protective against influenza-related hospitalization 
than were the standard-dose vaccines.


### CONCLUSIONS

The high-dose recombinant vaccine conferred more protection against PCR-con-
firmed influenza than an egg-based standard-dose vaccine among adults between 
the ages of 50 and 64 years. (Funded by Sanofi; ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT03694392.)

E
very year in the United States, in-
fluenza causes mild-to-severe illness in a 
wide range of persons (9 million to 41 
million).1 Influenza vaccination is the primary 
method for preventing influenza-related illness-
es,2 although the vaccine effectiveness ranges 
from 20% in years in which the vaccine is anti-
genically mismatched to the circulating viral 
strain to 40 to 60% in years in which the vaccine 
is antigenically well matched.2,3 This large varia-
tion in effectiveness between years suggests that 
more effective vaccines are needed.

In traditional quadrivalent standard-dose in-
activated influenza vaccines (SD-IIV4), chicken
eggs are used to manufacture the influenza
virus. Mutations in the hemagglutinin protein
during egg-based manufacturing can result in
mismatch between the selected strain and the
vaccine strain.4 The Flublok Quadrivalent influ-
enza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured
without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant
hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identi-
cal to that in the selected strain.5 The vaccine
also contains three times the amount of hemag-
glutinin protein as standard-dose vaccines, an
increased level that has been correlated with
increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.6
To estimate the relative effectiveness of the
recombinant vaccine as compared with standard-
dose vaccines against laboratory-confirmed in-
fluenza and influenza-related outcomes, we com-
pared the two formulations of vaccines among
members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern
California (KPNC) health care system who were
between 18 and 64 years of age during the two
influenza seasons of 2018–2019 and 2019–2020.


### Study Population and Oversight

KPNC is an integrated health care delivery sys-
tem with 4.6 million members, nearly 65% of
whom are adults between the ages of 18 and 64
years. Members receive nearly all their care at
system-owned facilities, which includes 259
medical clinics and 21 hospitals. The members’
electronic medical records capture all medical
services, including inpatient and outpatient di-
agnoses, laboratory tests, and vaccinations. The
KPNC members include approximately a third
of the population in Northern California and


### n engl j med 389;24  nejm.org  December 14, 2023

broadly represent adults in California regarding 
racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic characteristics, 
although the proportions of Hispanic, Asian, 
and multiracial residents are higher than those 
in other U.S. regions (Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix, available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org).7 Approximately 10% 
of the members are covered by Medicaid.8 The 
KPNC institutional review board approved the 
study with a waiver of informed consent.
Representatives of the study sponsor, Sanofi, 
did not have a role in the design or conduct of 
the study or in the analyses of the data. The 
Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine was 
donated by Sanofi, and the two standard-dose 
vaccines used during the study seasons were 
purchased by KPNC. The first author wrote the 
first draft of the manuscript. The authors vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data 
presented and for the fidelity of the study to the 
protocol (available at NEJM.org).


### Study Design

This was a cluster-randomized observationa
study that was designed to include all KPNC
members between the ages of 18 and 64 years
who had received a licensed recombinant or
standard-dose vaccine as part of routine clinica
care during the three influenza seasons from
2018 to 2021.9 The 2019–2020 season was trun-
cated in March 2020 because of the outbreak of
the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; data
from the 2020–2021 season were subsequently
excluded from the analyses because there were
too few cases of influenza during the pandemic
to be informative. During the study period, influ-
enza vaccination coverage was similar to nationa
coverage (Table S1). The study excluded unvac-
cinated patients.

The KPNC system includes seven geographic
regions, each containing 8 to 12 medical facili-
ties. In each region, the facilities were assigned
to either Block A or Block B to optimize the bal-
ance between blocks with respect to facility size
(Fig. 1). We randomly assigned Block A to start
with administration of a standard-dose vaccine
and Block B to start with administration of the
recombinant vaccine. Thereafter, each facility
alternated the administration of the two vac-
cines weekly.
Key features of the study design were that

formulations alternated in weekly intervals of time 
and that during each weekly interval, approxi-
mately half the facilities administered the re-
combinant vaccine while the other half adminis-
tered a standard-dose vaccine. The format of 
having alternating formulations each week at 
each facility was intended to emulate a random-

ized trial in which the vaccine formulations 
would be randomly assigned within each facility. 
This design was intended to achieve balance 
between the two vaccine groups, which would 
have similar distribution with respect to ob-
served and unobserved risk factors at every facil-
ity and in the overall study population during

the weeks when influenza was circulating. Pa-
tients were unaware of which vaccine was avail-
able at any facility. During the study period, the 
facilities administered primarily high-dose vac-
cines to adults who were 65 years of age or 
older, which made it infeasible to include those 
members in the study randomization.


### Outcomes

The primary outcome was influenza as con-
firmed by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test-
ing (Cepheid GeneXpert PCR assay, a test that 
also identifies respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]). 
Physicians at each facility ordered influenza PCR 
tests at their discretion on the basis of clinical 
presentation; rapid influenza antigen testing was 
not performed.
Secondary outcomes were PCR-confirmed in-
fluenza A, PCR-confirmed influenza B, and hos-
pitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, for 
community-acquired pneumonia, and for cardio-
respiratory events including community-acquired 
pneumonia. We identified community-acquired 
pneumonia and other cardiorespiratory events 
using primary discharge diagnosis codes as listed 
in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision (ICD-10) (Table S2).
Exploratory outcomes were an influenza diag-
nosis (PCR-confirmed or clinically diagnosed 
influenza on the basis of ICD-10 codes), nonelec-
tive hospitalization for any cause, and death 
from any cause. For each outcome except death 
from any cause, we counted only the first event 
during each season that occurred more than 14 
days after vaccination. All deaths after vaccina-
tion within the study period were considered to 
be a safety outcome and were counted even if they 
had occurred within 14 days after vaccination.


### Objectives

The primary objective was to estimate the rela-
tive vaccine effectiveness of the recombinant vac-
cine as compared with a standard-dose vaccine
against PCR-confirmed influenza in patients be-
tween the ages of 50 and 64 years, the primary
age group (Table S3). The secondary objectives
were to estimate the relative vaccine effective-
ness of the recombinant vaccine against second-
ary outcomes in patients in the primary age
group and against secondary outcomes in five
prespecified subgroups of patients with preex-


### n engl j med 389;24  nejm.org  December 14, 2023

isting conditions (cardiovascular disease, respi-
ratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity,
and diabetes) in the primary age group. Other
estimates of relative vaccine effectiveness were
considered to be exploratory.


### Statistical Analysis

We tested the null hypotheses that the recombi-
nant vaccine would not be any more or any less
effective than a standard-dose vaccine against
influenza, using a two-sided test with a P value
of less than 0.05 indicating statistical signifi-
cance. We estimated that the administration of
400,000 doses each of the two vaccine formula-
tions to patients between the ages of 18 and 64
years each influenza season would provide the
study with 86% power to detect a relative vaccine
effectiveness of 10.0% against PCR-confirmed
influenza. On the basis of previous data, we es-
timated the occurrence of 2.18 PCR-confirmed
influenza cases per 1000 participants in the
standard-dose group.
We used Cox regression analysis to estimate
the adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence
intervals for the recombinant vaccine as com-
pared with a standard-dose vaccine for each
outcome. The model specified a calendar time
scale and included adjustments for sex, race or
ethnic group, and age and an age-squared factor
(in case age and risk had either a linear or cur-
vilinear association). Risk sets were formed on
each date on which at least one outcome event
occurred in either study group. Each risk set
contained every participant in follow-up on that
calendar date. Most of the participants had been
vaccinated before the beginning of the influenza
season and were included in every risk set
throughout the season.

g
The Cox model also used stabilized weights
that were based on propensity scores. The statis-
tical analysis plan prespecified the use of pro-
pensity scores if imbalances were found in any
study variables. We observed modest imbalances
at some facilities in one or both seasons, although
not overall (Tables S4 and S5). Thus, we created
propensity scores that were specific for each fa-
cility and season. The propensity scores were
derived by logistic regression to estimate the
probability of the receipt of a recombinant vac-
cine rather than a standard-dose vaccine with
respect to sex, race, age, coexisting illnesses,


## Page 5

indicators of health care–seeking behavior (e.g., 
previous influenza vaccination), 2-month inter-
vals of calendar time, and other factors. Missing 
data were not imputed.
The relative vaccine effectiveness was based 
on the hazard ratio (1 minus the hazard ratio, 
expressed as a percentage). This calculation es-
timated the percent reduction in the incidence of 
the outcome in the recombinant-vaccine group 
as compared with that in the standard-dose 
group. The proportional-hazards assumption of 
the Cox regression was evaluated, and no viola-
tion was found (Fig. S1).

ments of the recombinant vaccine occasionally 
left some clinics temporarily without enough 
recombinant vaccine to comply with the week-
ly schedule, so standard-dose vaccines were 
then administered to prevent interruptions in 
patient care.
Among the 675,252 patients between 50 and 
64 years of age, 279,400 (41.4%) received the 
recombinant vaccine and 395,852 (58.6%) re-
ceived a standard-dose vaccine (Table 1). Among 
the 955,076 patients between 18 and 49 years of 
age, 353,562 (37.0%) received the recombinant 
vaccine and 601,514 (63.0%) received a standard-
dose vaccine (Table S6).
Of the 16,340 influenza PCR tests performed 
in the study population, 3821 (23.4%) were in-
fluenza positive. Of the PCR-confirmed influ-
enza cases, 1484 (38.8%) were diagnosed in pa-
tients between the ages of 50 and 64 years and 
2337 (61.2%) in patients between the ages of 18 
and 49 years. Among the participants with PCR-
confirmed influenza, hospitalization occurred 
in 248 of 1484 participants (16.7%) among those 
between the ages of 50 and 64 years and in 136 
of 2337 (5.8%) of those between the ages of 18 
and 49 years.
The demographic characteristics of the par-
ticipants at baseline were similar in the two vac-
cine groups and in the two age groups (Table 1 
and Table S6). There was some variation in the 
timing of the administration of the two vaccines 
according to geographic region, although during 
the two influenza seasons, most vaccinations 
in the two groups had occurred by mid-to-late 
November (Tables S4 and S5).

For secondary objectives in participants be-
tween the ages of 50 and 64 years, we adjusted 
for multiplicity by Holm’s method.10 Subgroup 
analyses involving participants with preexisting 
conditions were not adjusted for multiplicity. We 
conducted sensitivity analyses in which we used 
propensity scores in alternative ways, used a robust 
variance estimator, stratified risk sets according 
to facility and vaccination week, and specified 
age as a spline (see the Supplementary Methods 
section).
To assess possible residual confounding, we 
examined PCR-confirmed RSV infection as a 
negative control outcome because we would not 
expect influenza vaccination to be associated with 
a reduction in this infection. A nontrivial asso-
ciation between receipt of the recombinant vac-
cine and RSV infection would suggest bias in 
our estimate of the relative vaccine effectiveness 
against influenza. Conversely, a finding of no 
association between receipt of the recombinant 
vaccine and RSV infection would be reassuring 
that our estimates of relative vaccine effective-
ness were not biased by unmeasured factors that 
might affect the risk of both laboratory-con-
firmed RSV infection and influenza. All data 
analyses were performed with the use of SAS 
software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).


### Primary and Secondary Analyses

In patients between the ages of 50 and 64 years, 
559 (2.00 cases per 1000) tested positive for in-
fluenza in the recombinant-vaccine group as 
compared with 925 (2.34 per 1000) in the stan-
dard-dose group (Table 2). For the primary ob-
jective, the relative vaccine effectiveness of the 
recombinant vaccine as compared with standard-
dose vaccines against all PCR-confirmed influ-
enza was 15.3% (95% CI, 5.9 to 23.8; P = 0.002).
The estimate of relative vaccine effectiveness 
for the secondary objective of PCR-confirmed 
influenza A was 15.7% (95% CI, 6.0 to 24.5; 
P = 0.002; the P value was below Holm’s multi-
plicity-adjusted threshold of an alpha level of


### Study Participants

The study population included 1,630,328 partici-
pants during influenza seasons in 2018–2019 and 
2019–2020. Of these participants, 632,962 (38.8%) 
received the recombinant vaccine and 997,366 
(61.2%) received a standard-dose vaccine (Fig. 2 
and Table S6). In both seasons, delays in ship-

### Figure 2. Vaccinated Adults in the Study Population (2018–2021).

Shown is the final cohort of study participants between 18 and 64 years of age after the application of exclusion criteria. Patients who 
were vaccinated as inpatients were excluded from the study because such influenza vaccinations could not be included in the random-
zation. The eligible date ranges for influenza vaccinations were September 17, 2018, to April 21, 2019; September 3, 2019, to February 
25, 2020; and August 31, 2020, to April 8, 2021. In some cases, data were excluded from the analyses because records did not indicate 
the location of the facility where the vaccine had been administered. Propensity scores were derived by logistic regression to estimate 
the probability of the receipt of a recombinant vaccine rather than a standard-dose vaccine with respect to sex, race, age, coexisting ill-
nesses, indicators of health care–seeking behavior, 2-month intervals of calendar time, and other factors. Some patients were vaccinated at 
facilities where the data were too sparse to generate a facility-specific propensity score. Data for the third influenza season (2020–2021) 
were not included in the study because of virtually no circulation of influenza virus during the first year of the coronavirus disease 2019 
pandemic.

cine group as compared with 1510 participants
(2.51 cases per 1000) in the standard-dose group
(Table S8). For three exploratory objectives in this
age group, the relative vaccine effectiveness was
10.2% (95% CI, 1.4 to 18.2) against influenza A,
10.8% (95% CI, 6.6 to 14.7) against diagnosed
influenza, and 19.5% (95% CI, 5.4 to 31.5)
against influenza A in the subgroup with obe-
sity (Tables S7 and S8).

In the younger age group, the only explor-
atory objective for which the relative vaccine ef-
fectiveness was significantly below zero was 
death from any cause (−45.5; 95% CI, −100.2 to 
−5.8) (Table S8). During the two influenza sea-
sons, there were 145 deaths: 66 in the recombi-
nant-vaccine group and 79 in the standard-dose 
group; most of these deaths occurred at least 61 
days after vaccination. The most common causes 
of death in both study groups were cancer, ac-
cidents, homicide, suicide, and cardiovascular 
events (Table S9). Causes of death as assessed by 
chart review were not considered by the investi-
gators to be related to either influenza or influ-
enza vaccination.
Single-season estimates of relative vaccine ef-
fectiveness were generally consistent with the 
combined two-season estimates (Tables S10 and

S11). For the outcome of PCR-confirmed influ-
enza among patients in the older age group, 
relative vaccine effectiveness was 14.4% (95% CI, 
−1.1 to 27.5) during 2018–2019 and 16.1% (95% 
CI, 3.7 to 26.9) during 2019–2020.

For both the PCR-confirmed influenza and 
hospitalization outcomes, the results of sensitiv-
ity analyses were consistent with findings in the 
primary analyses (Tables S12 and S13). The esti-
mates of relative vaccine effectiveness from the 
RSV-negative control analyses did not differ 
from zero (Table S14).

In this real-world study, we evaluated the effec-
tiveness of a high-dose recombinant vaccine as
compared with an egg-based standard-dose vac-
cine among more than 1.6 million adults during
two influenza seasons. In our analysis of the
primary outcome in older patients between 50
and 64 years of age, the incidence of PCR-con-
firmed influenza was 15.3% lower among those
who received the recombinant vaccine than
among those who received a standard-dose vac-
cine, a finding that rejected the null hypothesis

Figure 3. Subgroup Analysis of Relative Vaccine Effectiveness against Influenza among Participants between 5
and 64 Years of Age, According to Preexisting Conditions.

Shown is a forest plot of the relative effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard-dose 
vaccine against influenza as confirmed by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed 
nfluenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia among study participants in the older age group
according to the presence of five prespecified preexisting conditions.

rred more protection against influenza than 
andard-dose vaccines was strengthened by our 
uster-randomized study design.
In secondary analyses involving the same 
der age group, the incidence of PCR-confirmed 
nfluenza A was 15.7% lower in the recombinant-
accine group than in the standard-dose group 
P = 0.002). Our analyses of the three additional 
econdary outcomes in this age group suggested 
hat the recombinant vaccine may confer more 
rotection than standard-dose vaccines against 
ospitalization outcomes. Although these find-
ngs were not significant, a post hoc analysis 
ombining hospitalization for PCR-confirmed 
nfluenza and hospitalization for community-
cquired pneumonia yielded a relative vaccine 
ffectiveness of 19.7% (95% CI, 2.8 to 33.7).
The 12 exploratory analyses yielded some-
hat inconsistent results. For influenza diagno-
es overall (including unconfirmed diagnoses) 
mong patients between the ages of 18 and 49 
ears, the incidence was lower in the recombi-
nant-vaccine group than in the standard-dose
group (relative vaccine effectiveness, 10.8%; 95%
CI, 6.6 to 14.7). For PCR-confirmed influenza A,
the incidence was similarly lower in the recom-
binant-vaccine group (relative vaccine effective-
ness, 10.2; 95% CI, 1.4 to 18.2). For 5 of the
other 10 exploratory analyses (2 of which were
performed in participants between 50 and 64
years of age), the estimated relative vaccine ef-
fectiveness was in the range of 1 to 10% with
95% confidence intervals overlapping 0%. The
remaining 5 exploratory analyses (1 of which
was performed in participants between 50 and
64 years of age) yielded negative estimates for
relative vaccine effectiveness, including the anal-
ysis of death from any cause among participants
between 18 and 49 years of age (relative vaccine
effectiveness, −45.5; 95% CI, −100.2 to −5.8).
Chart reviews of all 145 deaths in this age group
did not suggest that the recombinant vaccine
caused any deaths or that standard-dose vaccines
prevented more deaths than the recombinant

vaccine. Mortality in both groups of vaccinees 
was substantially lower than population-wide 
mortality at KPNC and nationwide in a similar 
age group.11,12

If standard-dose vaccines were already pre-
venting most cases of influenza and break-
through cases were uncommon, preventing 15% 
of breakthrough cases would be of modest pub-
lic health benefit. However, since standard-dose 
vaccines prevent at most 40 to 60% of influenza 
cases annually,13 reducing the incidence of break-
through influenza by 15% would provide a sub-
stantial public health benefit, especially during 
more severe influenza seasons.
Several studies have shown benefit for the 
recombinant vaccine and other high-dose influ-
enza vaccines as compared with standard-dose 
vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or 
older, findings that have been attributed to an 
improved immune response.5,14-17 In the current 
study, we compared the effectiveness of the 
high-dose recombinant vaccine with that of 
standard-dose vaccines in patients between the 
ages of 18 and 64 years. The effectiveness of 
standard-dose vaccines — especially against the 
influenza A H3N2 subtype — may be attenuated 
by antigenic drift during egg-based manufactur-
ing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not 
susceptible to such drift. However, data from the 
California Department of Public Health showed 
that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the 
second half of the 2018–2019 season,18 and even 
then, the circulating strain had drifted such that 
it was poorly matched to both the recombinant 
vaccine and the standard-dose vaccines.19,20 Dur-
ing our study period, the observed benefit of the 
recombinant vaccine as compared with a stan-
dard-dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher 
relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than 
to higher effectiveness against influenza A over-
all associated with its higher dose of hemagglu-
tinin antigen.
A strength of our study is that the two study 
vaccine formulations were alternated in weekly 
intervals of time at each facility, which allowed 
us to balance covariates of interest as designed. 
In every KPNC geographic area, when influenza 
arrived, there were already participants who had 
received one of the two formulations of vaccine 
and who were similar with respect to demo-
graphic characteristics, coexisting illnesses,

health care–seeking behavior, and the number 
of weeks since vaccination. To our knowledge, 
this design has not been previously used, and its 
handling of potential confounding bias has not 
been formally studied. Our intent was to mini-
mize imbalances between the participants who 
received each vaccine, both within and between 
facilities. We also included several sensitivity 
analyses to address potential biases from clus-
tering according to facility. Sensitivity analyses 
that were stratified either according to facility 
(to compare within facilities) or according to 
week (to compare between facilities) showed a 
relative vaccine effectiveness of approximately 
15%, similar to the findings of our primary 
analysis.
Our study also has several limitations. First, 
in our real-world setting, compliance with the 
weekly assigned vaccine schedule occasionally 
varied because of logistic constraints, including 
supply-chain issues for the recombinant vaccine, 
which led to different numbers of participants in 
the two groups. Second, our data were limited to 
two influenza seasons; relative vaccine effective-
ness may vary across seasons, depending on the 
vaccine match with circulating strains. Third, 
our primary outcome did not include infections 
in persons who did not undergo PCR testing, 
which limits its generalizability. Fourth, the study 
had limited power to detect a clinically mean-
ingful benefit of the recombinant vaccine as 
compared with a standard-dose vaccine with 
respect to less frequent outcomes, such as hos-
pitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza. Finally, 
although KPNC has a diverse population, it may 
not be representative of other populations in the 
United States.

In this study performed during two influenza
seasons, participants between the ages of 50 and
64 years who received the recombinant vaccine
had more protection against confirmed influenza
than those who received a standard-dose vaccine.
