      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that egg-based vaccines are susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which is a form of mutation that can reduce vaccine effectiveness. It directly supports the claim that mutations can develop during production in egg-based vaccines.",

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that standard dose influenza vaccines are produced using chicken eggs, which is relevant because the process of growing viruses in eggs is known to introduce mutations, supporting the claim about the potential for mutations during production.",
