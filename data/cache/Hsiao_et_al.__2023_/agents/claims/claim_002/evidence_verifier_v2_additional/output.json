      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the following form: 'BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' This matches the quoted text in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent'). The key facts and technical content are preserved.. The quote directly states that the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which implies that egg-based vaccines are susceptible to antigenic drift (a form of mutation) during production. This supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote explicitly contrasts the susceptibility of egg-based vaccines to antigenic drift with the resistance of recombinant vaccines, thus directly supporting the claim.",
