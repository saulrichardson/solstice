      "explanation": "The quote 'the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing' appears in the BACKGROUND section of the document, with only minor differences in capitalization and context. The sentence is: 'the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.'. The quote directly states that recombinant vaccines are not susceptible to antigenic drift (mutations) during manufacturing. By contrasting this with the context of egg-based vaccines, which are known to be susceptible to such drift, it supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness. The document further reinforces this in the discussion: 'The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines \u2014 especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype \u2014 may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.' Thus, the quote and its context genuinely support the claim.",
