      "quote": "The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 10 of the document: 'The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.' The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'H3N2' vs 'H3 N2').. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the effectiveness of standard dose (egg-based) vaccines may be reduced ('attenuated') by antigenic drift (mutations) that occur during egg-based manufacturing. This directly addresses the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote also contrasts this with recombinant vaccines, which are not susceptible to such drift, further reinforcing the point."

      "quote": "BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the following form: 'BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' This matches the quoted text in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent'). The key facts and technical content are preserved.. The quote directly states that the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which implies that egg-based vaccines are susceptible to antigenic drift (a form of mutation) during production. This supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote explicitly contrasts the susceptibility of egg-based vaccines to antigenic drift with the resistance of recombinant vaccines, thus directly supporting the claim."
