      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that recombinant vaccines are not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, implying that egg-based vaccines are susceptible to such drift (mutations), which can reduce effectiveness. It directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based vaccines can develop mutations during production that may impact their effectiveness."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that antigenic drift (mutations) during egg-based manufacturing can reduce the effectiveness of standard dose vaccines, supporting the claim that mutations arising during production may lower vaccine effectiveness."
