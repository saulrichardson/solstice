      "explanation": "A very similar version of the quote appears on page 10: 'The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines \u2014 especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype \u2014 may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and spacing.. This quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the effectiveness of standard dose (egg-based) vaccines may be reduced ('attenuated') by antigenic drift (mutations) that occur during egg-based manufacturing. It also contrasts this with recombinant vaccines, which are not susceptible to such drift. This directly substantiates the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness.",
