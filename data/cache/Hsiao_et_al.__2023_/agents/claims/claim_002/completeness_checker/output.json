      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 10 of the document: 'The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.' The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'H3N2' vs 'H3 N2').. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the effectiveness of standard dose (egg-based) vaccines may be reduced ('attenuated') by antigenic drift (mutations) that occur during egg-based manufacturing. This directly addresses the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote also contrasts this with recombinant vaccines, which are not susceptible to such drift, further reinforcing the point.",
