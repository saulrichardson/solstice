  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing two influenza vaccine groups (cell-based vs egg-based) across primary and secondary outcomes, showing number of cases per 1000, adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs, vaccine effectiveness percentages, and P values for PCR-confirmed influenza and various hospitalization outcomes. does not support the claim because the table presents comparative clinical effectiveness data without any information on production-related mutations or their impact on vaccine performance. Note: Image shows clear outcome data but no mechanistic details on mutation potential during vaccine production.",
