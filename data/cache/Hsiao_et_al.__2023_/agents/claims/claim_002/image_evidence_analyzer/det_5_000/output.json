  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the selection of study participants aged 18\u201364 years who received either a recombinant vaccine (1,018,043 initial recipients) or a standard-dose vaccine (1,758,235 initial recipients) over three influenza seasons, with successive exclusion steps (non-members, inpatient vaccinations, out-of-range dates, missing facility identifiers, inability to assign propensity scores) leading to final cohorts of 632,962 recombinant vaccine recipients and 997,366 standard-dose vaccine recipients. The figure is solely a CONSORT-style flow diagram of participant inclusion and exclusion and contains no data or statements about mutations arising during egg- or cell-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is adequate for reading participant flow; however, no mutation or effectiveness data are presented.",
