  "explanation": "A three-panel figure showing: (1) nine service-area facilities represented as differently sized rectangles; (2) the same facilities matched by size into two blocks (Block A and Block B) with arrows indicating pairings; (3) a table listing each facility\u2019s block assignment and the alternating weekly influenza vaccine formulation received (SD-IIV4 vs RIV4) over four weeks. does not support the claim because the figure only illustrates the cluster randomization and alternating use of two vaccine formulations (standard-dose inactivated vs recombinant) and contains no information about cell- or egg-based vaccine production mutations or their impact on effectiveness.",
