  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image shows the title, author list, and beginning of the abstract of a clinical article titled \"Recombinant or Standard-Dose Influenza Vaccine in Adults under 65 Years of Age.\" It includes introductory text stating that trivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the hemagglutinin protein amount compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines and notes that recombinant vaccine material is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. The content presented does not mention the development of mutations during production of cell- or egg-based vaccines or their impact on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: Only the first page title and abstract introduction are visible; full methods or results where production-related mutations might be discussed are not shown.",
