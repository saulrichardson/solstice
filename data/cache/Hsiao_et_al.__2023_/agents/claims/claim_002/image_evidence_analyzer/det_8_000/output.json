  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "Forest plot of relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI) comparing a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine for outcomes (PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia) among participants aged 50\u201364, stratified by preexisting conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any condition). does not support the claim because the figure only shows subgroup analyses of clinical effectiveness of recombinant versus standard-dose vaccines and contains no information about mutations arising during cell- or egg-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness.",
