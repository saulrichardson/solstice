  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the selection and exclusion of adults aged 18\u201364 years vaccinated with either a recombinant influenza vaccine (N=1,018,043 initially) or a standard-dose vaccine (N=1,758,235 initially) across the 2018\u20132021 seasons, showing numbers removed for nonmembership, inpatient vaccinations, outside eligible date ranges, missing facility identifiers, inability to assign propensity scores, and final cohort sizes for each vaccine group. does not support the claim because the figure only details cohort selection and participant counts for recombinant versus standard-dose vaccines and provides no data on immune response breadth or cross-protection in mismatch seasons Note: The figure is purely a study flow diagram without any immunogenicity or efficacy outcomes; no information on immune response or cross-protection is presented.",
