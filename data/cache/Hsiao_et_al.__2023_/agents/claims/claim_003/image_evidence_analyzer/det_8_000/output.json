  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% CI) of a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine among participants aged 50\u201364 years, across subgroups defined by preexisting conditions (PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia; cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, and any of these conditions). The x-axis is percentage effectiveness, and each subgroup has a point estimate with horizontal error bars. The figure presents comparative effectiveness data for a recombinant versus standard-dose influenza vaccine across clinical subgroups but does not provide any data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or performance in a mismatch season, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clear but does not include information on mismatch seasons or immunologic breadth; context on season match/mismatch and mechanistic immune response is missing.",
