  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image is a multi-part figure illustrating the design of a cluster-randomized trial. The top panel shows boxes representing 9 Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities of varying sizes within a service area. The middle panel groups similarly sized facilities into two blocks (Block A and Block B) for random assignment. Arrows link facilities of similar size across the two blocks. The bottom panel is a table listing each facility by block, with four columns (Week 1 to Week 4) indicating alternating administration of SD-IIV4 (standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine) and RIV4 (quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine) in weekly intervals. The figure solely describes the study\u2019s facility randomization and weekly alternating vaccine assignment schedule; it contains no data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or mismatch-season effectiveness and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The figure presents only trial design and vaccine allocation, with no immunogenicity or cross-protection results visible.",
