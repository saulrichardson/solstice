  "explanation": "A table comparing outcomes for two vaccine cohorts (N=279,400 vs N=395,852) showing number of cases per 1000 for PCR-confirmed influenza (overall, A, B) and hospitalizations, with unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios, vaccine effectiveness percentages (with 95% CI), and P values. The table reports vaccine effectiveness against PCR-confirmed influenza A and B and related hospitalizations but does not address recombinant technology or cross-protection in a mismatch season, and therefore does not support the claim.
