      "relevance_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by explaining that recombinant vaccines are not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which is a key mechanism by which vaccine mismatch occurs. This property could lead to broader immune responses and potential cross-protection in mismatch seasons.",
