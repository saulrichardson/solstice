      "original_explanation": "This quote explains that recombinant vaccines are not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which is a key mechanism by which vaccine mismatch occurs. This supports the claim that recombinant technology can provide broader immune responses and potential cross-protection in mismatch seasons."

      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This statement directly contrasts the susceptibility of standard vaccines to antigenic drift (which can cause mismatch) with the stability of recombinant vaccines, supporting the idea that recombinant technology may provide broader protection even when circulating strains differ from vaccine strains."

      "quote": "However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall in periods with a mismatch and from the higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",

      "original_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that the recombinant vaccine showed higher effectiveness even in a season with a poorly matched (drifted) strain, supporting the claim that recombinant technology can provide cross-protection in mismatch seasons."
