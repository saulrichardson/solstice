      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "A very similar version of the quote appears on page 10: 'The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines \u2014 especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype \u2014 may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and spacing.. The quote directly states that standard dose (egg-based) vaccines are susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which can lead to vaccine mismatch, while recombinant vaccines are not susceptible to such drift. This supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, because it implies that recombinant vaccines maintain their intended antigenic profile and are less affected by mismatch due to drift.",
