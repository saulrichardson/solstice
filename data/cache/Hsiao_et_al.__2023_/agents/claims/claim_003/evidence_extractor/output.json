      "quote": "Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that recombinant vaccines are not affected by antigenic drift during manufacturing, which is a key mechanism by which vaccine mismatch occurs. This supports the claim that recombinant technology may provide broader immune responses and cross-protection in mismatch seasons."

      "quote": "The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines \u2014 especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype \u2014 may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This statement directly contrasts the susceptibility of standard vaccines to antigenic drift (which can cause mismatch) with the stability of recombinant vaccines, supporting the idea that recombinant technology can provide broader protection even when there is a mismatch."

      "quote": "Several studies have shown benefit for the recombinant vaccine and other high dose influenza vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or older, findings that have been attributed to an improved immune response.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote links the improved immune response of recombinant vaccines to their greater effectiveness, supporting the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response."
