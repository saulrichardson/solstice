      "explanation": "A nearly identical quote appears in the BACKGROUND section: 'Quad rival ent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' The wording matches the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing and line breaks.. The quote directly states that recombinant influenza vaccines are not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which is a key mechanism by which vaccine mismatch occurs. This property supports the claim that recombinant technology can lead to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection in mismatch seasons, as the vaccine antigens remain a better match to circulating strains. The mention of three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein also supports the idea of a broader or stronger immune response.",
