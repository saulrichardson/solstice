      "quote": "BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.",
      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote explains that recombinant vaccines are not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which is a key mechanism by which vaccine mismatch occurs. This supports the claim that recombinant technology may provide broader immune responses and cross-protection in mismatch seasons."

      "quote": "The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in periods with either matched or mismatched strains.",
      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This passage directly addresses the issue of vaccine mismatch and notes that the recombinant vaccine provided higher effectiveness against influenza A even when the circulating strain was poorly matched, supporting the idea of broader immune response and cross-protection."
