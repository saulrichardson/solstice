The quote directly states that the study compared the effectiveness of the high dose recombinant vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) with standard dose vaccines in the specified age group. The methods and background sections of the document confirm that Flublok Quadrivalent was the recombinant vaccine used, and that the comparator was standard dose quadrivalent vaccines (such as Fluarix). Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.",
