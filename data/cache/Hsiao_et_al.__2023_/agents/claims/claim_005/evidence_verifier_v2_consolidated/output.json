      "explanation": "A very similar version of the quote appears on page 10: 'In the current study, we compared the effectiveness of the high dose recombinant vaccine with that of standard dose vaccines in patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences (e.g., 'high dose recombinant vaccine' instead of 'high dose recombinant vaccine', and 'patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years' instead of 'patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years').. The quote directly states that the study compared the effectiveness of the high dose recombinant vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) with standard dose vaccines in the specified age group. The methods and background sections of the document confirm that Flublok Quadrivalent was the recombinant vaccine used, and that the comparator was standard dose quadrivalent vaccines (such as Fluarix). Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.",
