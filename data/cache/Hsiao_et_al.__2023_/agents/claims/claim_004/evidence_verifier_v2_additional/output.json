For the primary objective, the relative vaccine effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine as compared with standard-dose vaccines against all PCR-confirmed influenza was 15.3% (95% CI, 5.9 to 23.8; P = 0 002.",

      "quote": "For secondary objectives in participants between the ages of 50 and 64 years, we adjusted for multiplicity by Holm\u2019s method.10 Subgroup analyses involving participants with preexisting conditions were not adjusted for multiplicity. We conducted sensitivity analyses in which we used propensity scores in alternative ways, used a robust variance estimator, stratified risk sets according to facility and vaccination week, and specified age as a spline (see the Supplementary Methods section). To assess possible residual confounding, we examined PCR-confirmed RSV infection as a negative control outcome because we would not expect influenza vaccination to be associated with a reduction in this infection. A nontrivial association between receipt of the recombinant vaccine and RSV infection would suggest bias in our estimate of the relative vaccine effectiveness against influenza. Conversely, a finding of no association between receipt of the recombinant vaccine and RSV infection would be reassuring that our estimates of relative vaccine effectiveness were not biased by unmeasured factors that might affect the risk of both laboratory confirmed RSV infection and influenza.",
