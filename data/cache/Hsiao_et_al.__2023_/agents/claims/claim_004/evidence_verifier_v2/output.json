      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "A nearly identical quote appears in the 'BACKGROUND' section: 'Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' The wording matches the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and spacing.. The quote directly states that the recombinant vaccine contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines. Since hemagglutinin is the key antigen that induces antibody responses, a higher dose provides a mechanistic rationale for a more robust antibody response. This supports the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines.",

The quote provides direct evidence that the recombinant (higher-dose) vaccine was more effective than the standard-dose egg-based vaccine in preventing PCR-confirmed influenza and influenza A, as shown by the positive relative vaccine effectiveness percentages and statistically significant p-values. This increased effectiveness is consistent with a more robust antibody response, supporting the claim.",
