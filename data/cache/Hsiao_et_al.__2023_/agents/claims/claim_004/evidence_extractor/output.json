      "quote": "Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides a mechanistic basis for why the recombinant vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response, as it contains a higher dose of the key antigen (hemagglutinin) compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines."

The estimate of relative vaccine effectiveness for the secondary objective of PCR-confirmed influenza A was 15.7% (95% CI, 6.0 to 24.5; P = 0.002).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that the higher-dose recombinant vaccine was more effective than the standard-dose egg-based vaccine in preventing PCR-confirmed influenza, which is consistent with a more robust antibody response."

      "quote": "Several studies have shown benefit for the recombinant vaccine and other high dose influenza vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or older, findings that have been attributed to an improved immune response.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote links the improved effectiveness of high-dose and recombinant vaccines to an improved immune (antibody) response, directly supporting the claim."
