The wording matches the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and spacing.. The quote directly states that the recombinant vaccine contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines. Since hemagglutinin is the key antigen that induces antibody responses, a higher dose provides a mechanistic rationale for a more robust antibody response. This supports the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines.",

      "quote": "For secondary objectives in participants between the ages of 50 and 64 years, we adjusted for multiplicity by Holm\u2019s method.10 Subgroup analyses involving participants with preexisting conditions were not adjusted for multiplicity. We conducted sensitivity analyses in which we used propensity scores in alternative ways, used a robust variance estimator, stratified risk sets according to facility and vaccination week, and specified age as a spline (see the Supplementary Methods section). To assess possible residual confounding, we examined PCR-confirmed RSV infection as a negative control outcome because we would not expect influenza vaccination to be associated with a reduction in this infection. A nontrivial association between receipt of the recombinant vaccine and RSV infection would suggest bias in our estimate of the relative vaccine effectiveness against influenza. Conversely, a finding of no association between receipt of the recombinant vaccine and RSV infection would be reassuring that our estimates of relative vaccine effectiveness were not biased by unmeasured factors that might affect the risk of both laboratory confirmed RSV infection and influenza.",
