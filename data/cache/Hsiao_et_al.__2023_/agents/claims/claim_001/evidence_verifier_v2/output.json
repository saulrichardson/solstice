This matches the provided quote in both factual content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines. While the quote does not itself mention immunogenicity, the claim's first part about antigen content is fully supported by this quote. The second part of the claim (link to greater immunogenicity) is not addressed by this quote, but the quote does not contradict it, and the first part is directly substantiated.",

This matches the quote to be verified in both meaning and technical content.. The quote directly links the greater effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine (Flublok) compared to standard-dose vaccines to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.
