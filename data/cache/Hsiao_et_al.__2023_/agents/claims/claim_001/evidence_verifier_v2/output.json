The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote directly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines, which supports the first part of the claim. Additionally, elsewhere in the document, it is mentioned that this increased level of hemagglutinin has been correlated with greater immunogenicity, supporting the second part of the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.",

The quote directly states that the vaccine (Flublok) contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, and that this increased level has been correlated with greater immunogenicity. This supports both parts of the claim: the higher HA antigen content and its link to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines.",
