      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein compared to standard dose vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote confirms that the study directly compared the high dose recombinant vaccine (Flublok) to standard dose vaccines, which is necessary context for linking antigen content to immunogenicity and effectiveness."

The estimate of relative vaccine effectiveness for the secondary objective of PCR-confirmed influenza A was 15.7% (95% CI, 6.0 to 24.5; P = 0.002).",

      "quote": "Several studies have shown benefit for the recombinant vaccine and other high dose influenza vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or older, findings that have been attributed to an improved immune response.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote links the improved effectiveness of high dose and recombinant vaccines to an improved immune response, supporting the claim that higher HA content is associated with greater immunogenicity."

    {
      "id": 5,
      "quote": "During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly attributes the greater effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen, supporting the claim that increased HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity."
