      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein compared to standard dose vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote clarifies the distinction between standard dose vaccines and Flublok, confirming that Flublok is the recombinant vaccine referenced in the claim."

      "quote": "In patients between the ages of 50 and 64 years, 559 (2.00 cases per 1000) tested positive for influenza in the recombinant vaccine group as compared with 925 (2.34 per 1000) in the standard dose group (Table 2). For the primary objective, the relative vaccine effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine as compared with standard dose vaccines against all PCR-confirmed influenza was 15.3% (95% CI, 5.9 to 23.8; P = 0.002). The estimate of relative vaccine effectiveness for the secondary objective of PCR-confirmed influenza A was 15.7% (95% CI, 6.0 to 24.5; P = 0.002).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that the recombinant vaccine (Flublok, with 3x HA content) was more effective than standard dose vaccines in preventing PCR-confirmed influenza, supporting the link between higher HA content and greater immunogenicity/effectiveness."
