  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing demographic and clinical characteristics of participants (N=675,252) in two vaccine groups: recombinant influenza vaccine (N=279,400) and standard-dose influenza vaccine (N=395,852). Characteristics include sex, race/ethnic group, Hispanic ethnicity, underlying illnesses (asthma, diabetes, COPD, coronary heart disease), and receipt of influenza vaccine in the previous year. The table provides participant demographics and clinical characteristics but contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparisons of antigen doses between vaccines, so it does not support the claim.",
