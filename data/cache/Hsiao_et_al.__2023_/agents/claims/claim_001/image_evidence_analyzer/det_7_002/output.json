  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing clinical outcomes (PCR-confirmed influenza, PCR-confirmed influenza A and B, hospitalizations for PCR-confirmed influenza, community-acquired pneumonia, and cardiorespiratory events) between two vaccine groups (N=279,400 vs N=395,852). It lists the number of cases per 1000, unadjusted rate ratio, adjusted rate ratio with 95% CI, vaccine effectiveness percentages with 95% CI, and P values for primary and secondary outcomes. The table presents comparative clinical effectiveness data but contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity measures. Therefore, it does not support the claim about Flublok\u2019s HA antigen content being three times that of standard-dose vaccines or its link to greater immunogenicity. Note: The image is clear and legible; however, the content does not address antigen dosage or immunogenicity endpoints.",
