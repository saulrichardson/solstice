  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A forest plot showing subgroup analyses of the relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI) of a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose influenza vaccine for PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia among participants aged 50\u201364 years, stratified by preexisting conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above conditions). The figure displays relative clinical effectiveness outcomes and does not present or quantify hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim.",
