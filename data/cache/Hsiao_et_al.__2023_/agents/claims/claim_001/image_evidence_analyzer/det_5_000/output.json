  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the selection and exclusion of study participants aged 18\u201364 years who received either a recombinant influenza vaccine or a standard-dose vaccine over three seasons, with stepwise counts of participants excluded for nonmembership, inpatient vaccinations, out-of-range dates, missing facility identifiers, inability to assign propensity scores, and final cohort sizes for each vaccine group. The figure is a participant flow diagram and does not present any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clear but does not include any antigen dose or immunogenicity metrics, limiting its relevance to the claim.",
