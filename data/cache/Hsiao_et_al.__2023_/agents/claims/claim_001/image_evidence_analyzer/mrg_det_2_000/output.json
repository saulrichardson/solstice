  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The figure shows the cluster randomization design for Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities, grouping facilities by size into Block A and Block B and alternating weekly administration of SD-IIV4 (standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine) and RIV4 (quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine) across nine facilities for four illustrative weeks. The image only depicts the randomization schedule of SD-IIV4 versus RIV4 by facility and week; it contains no information on antigen (HA) content or comparative immunogenicity and therefore does not support the claim.",
