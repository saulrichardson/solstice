The quote directly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines, which supports the first part of the claim. Additionally, elsewhere in the document, it is mentioned that this increased level of hemagglutinin has been correlated with greater immunogenicity, supporting the second part of the claim.

The quote directly states that the vaccine (Flublok) contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, and that this increased level has been correlated with greater immunogenicity.
