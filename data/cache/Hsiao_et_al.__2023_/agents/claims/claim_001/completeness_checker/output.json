This matches the quoted text in both factual content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines. While the quote does not directly address immunogenicity, it provides the specific factual basis (3x HA content) that is linked in the claim to greater immunogenicity.

The quote provides direct evidence that the recombinant vaccine (Flublok), which the document's background section explicitly states contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, was more effective than standard dose vaccines in preventing PCR-confirmed influenza. The data show a statistically significant higher effectiveness (relative vaccine effectiveness of 15.3% and 15.7% for all influenza and influenza A, respectively) in the 50-64 age group. This supports the claim that the higher HA antigen content is linked to greater immunogenicity/effectiveness compared to standard-dose flu vaccines.",
