This matches the provided quote in both factual content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines. While the quote does not itself mention immunogenicity, the claim's first part about antigen content is fully supported by this quote. The second part of the claim (link to greater immunogenicity) is not addressed by this quote, but the quote does not contradict it, and the first part is directly substantiated.",

      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 10 of the document, with only minor differences in wording.

This matches the quote to be verified in both meaning and technical content.. The quote directly links the greater effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine (Flublok) compared to standard-dose vaccines to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen. This supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines and that this increased HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity (i.e., greater effectiveness) versus standard-dose vaccines. The document also explicitly states in the background that 'Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines,' further substantiating the claim.",
