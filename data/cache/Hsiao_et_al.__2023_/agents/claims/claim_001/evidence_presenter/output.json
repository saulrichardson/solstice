      "quote": "BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the following form: 'BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' This matches the quoted text in both factual content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines. While the quote does not directly address immunogenicity, it provides the specific factual basis (3x HA content) that is linked in the claim to greater immunogenicity. The document elsewhere discusses the improved effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine, which is consistent with the claim's second part, but the quote itself is sufficient to support the claim as stated."

      "quote": "In patients between the ages of 50 and 64 years, 559 (2.00 cases per 1000) tested positive for influenza in the recombinant vaccine group as compared with 925 (2.34 per 1000) in the standard dose group (Table 2). For the primary objective, the relative vaccine effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine as compared with standard dose vaccines against all PCR-confirmed influenza was 15.3% (95% CI, 5.9 to 23.8; P = 0.002). The estimate of relative vaccine effectiveness for the secondary objective of PCR-confirmed influenza A was 15.7% (95% CI, 6.0 to 24.5; P = 0.002).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and word order. The key facts, numbers, and technical content are preserved: 'In patients between the ages of 50 and 64 years, 559 (2.00 cases per 1000) tested positive for influenza in the recombinant vaccine group as compared with 925 (2.34 per 1000) in the standard dose group (Table 2). For the primary objective, the relative vaccine effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine as compared with standard dose vaccines against all PCR-confirmed influenza was 15.3% (95% CI, 5.9 to 23.8; P = 0.002). The estimate of relative vaccine effectiveness for the secondary objective of PCR-confirmed influenza A was 15.7% (95% CI, 6.0 to 24.5; P = 0.002).' This matches the quote to verify.. The quote provides direct evidence that the recombinant vaccine (Flublok), which the document's background section explicitly states contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, was more effective than standard dose vaccines in preventing PCR-confirmed influenza. The data show a statistically significant higher effectiveness (relative vaccine effectiveness of 15.3% and 15.7% for all influenza and influenza A, respectively) in the 50-64 age group. This supports the claim that the higher HA antigen content is linked to greater immunogenicity/effectiveness compared to standard-dose flu vaccines."

      "quote": "During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 10 of the document, with only minor differences in wording. The document states: 'During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.' This matches the quote to be verified in both meaning and technical content.. The quote directly links the observed higher effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine (Flublok) compared to standard-dose vaccines to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen. This supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines and that this increased HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity and effectiveness. The document also explicitly states in the background that 'Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines,' further substantiating the claim."
