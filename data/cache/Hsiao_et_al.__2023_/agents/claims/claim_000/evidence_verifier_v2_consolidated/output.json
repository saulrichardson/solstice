The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in spacing and punctuation.. The quote directly states that Flublok's hemagglutinin protein is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. Since the selected strain refers to the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains for the season, this supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with those strains. The quote is explicit and does not require inference.",

      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote 'the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing' appears verbatim in the BACKGROUND section of the document. There are no significant differences between the provided quote and the text in the document.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that the recombinant formulation (Flublok) is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. This means the antigenic properties of the vaccine remain identical to those of the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as antigenic drift during manufacturing is a known cause of mismatch in traditional egg-based vaccines. Therefore, the quote substantiates the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with the selected strains.",
