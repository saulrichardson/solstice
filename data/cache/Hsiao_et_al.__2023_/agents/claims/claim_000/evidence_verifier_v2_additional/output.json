      "explanation": "A very close version of the quote appears in the document: 'The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and spacing.. The quote directly states that the hemagglutinin protein in Flublok is 'genetically identical to that in the selected strain.' Since the selected strain refers to the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains for the season, this supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with those strains. The quote is explicit and does not require significant inference.",
