      "quote": "Several studies have shown benefit for the recombinant vaccine and other high dose influenza vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or older, findings that have been attributed to an improved immune response.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by stating that the improved immune response (greater immunogenicity) of recombinant and high-dose vaccines compared to standard-dose vaccines has been observed in studies, directly linking higher antigen content to greater immunogenicity.",
