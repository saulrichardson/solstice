Each outcome is stratified by participants\u2019 preexisting conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, and any of the above conditions). does not support the claim because the figure only presents subgroup relative effectiveness data and contains no information on antigenic match or alignment with WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, so it does not support the claim.",
