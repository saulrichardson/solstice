  "explanation": "A schematic diagram showing the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) service area\u2019s facilities of various sizes grouped into two randomized blocks (Block A and Block B), and a table listing how each facility alternates weekly between SD-IIV4 (standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine) and RIV4 (quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine) over four weeks. does not support the claim because the figure only shows cluster randomization of SD-IIV4 versus RIV4 administrations and contains no information about Flublok or antigenic matching with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains. Note: The image is clear but limited to the design of vaccine randomization in facilities; it does not address antigen composition or regulatory matching.",
