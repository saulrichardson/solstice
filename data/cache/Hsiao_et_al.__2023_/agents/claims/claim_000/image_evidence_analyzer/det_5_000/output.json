The image does not support the claim: it details participant inclusion/exclusion for vaccine cohorts and provides no information on antigenic matching with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: No information on antigenic match or WHO/FDA strain selection is present; the image only covers study population flow.",
