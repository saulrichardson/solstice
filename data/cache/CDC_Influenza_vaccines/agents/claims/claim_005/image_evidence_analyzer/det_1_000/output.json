  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table displaying vaccine product information, including trade name/manufacturer, presentation (e.g., 0.5-mL PFS), age indication, antigen content per dose, and route of administration for Fluad Quadrivalent (Seqirus), Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur), and FluMist Quadrivalent (AstraZeneca). The table provides product characteristics for Flublok Quadrivalent but does not mention Fluarix or any pivotal trial comparing Flublok to Fluarix, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but contains only product details, with no trial data or comparative evaluation mentioned.",
