  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing available quadrivalent influenza vaccines by type (IIV4, RIV4, LAIV4), including trade name, manufacturer, presentations, age indication, antigen content per dose, route, and mercury content. Under RIV4 it lists Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur), 0.5 mL prefilled syringe, for ages \u226518 years, 45 \u00b5g per 0.5 mL, intramuscular, no thimerosal. The table provides vaccine product characteristics but contains no information on a pivotal clinical trial or a comparison of Flublok with Fluarix. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but does not include any trial or comparator data.",
