  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular list of licensed influenza vaccines showing formulation type (standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose egg-based), presentations, age indications, HA antigen content per dose, route of administration, and thimerosal content. The table presents only antigen dose and formulation details, without any immunogenicity or antibody response data; thus it does not support the claim. Note: Image is limited to dosage and formulation data; immunogenicity results are not provided.",
