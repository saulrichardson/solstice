  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table listing influenza vaccine formulations including trade name, presentation, age indication, hemagglutinin (HA) content per dose, route, and mercury content. It shows IIV4 (egg-based) vaccines with 15 \u00b5g HA/strain per 0.5 mL dose and a recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4, Flublok Quadrivalent) with 45 \u00b5g HA/strain per 0.5 mL dose. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g HA/0.5 mL compared with 15 \u00b5g HA/0.5 mL for egg-based IIV4. The table does not support the claim because it provides antigen dose information only and lacks any data on antibody responses, so it doesn\u2019t support the claim that higher-dose recombinant vaccination induces a more robust antibody response. Note: Limited by absence of immunogenicity or antibody titer data; table only shows HA content per dose.",
