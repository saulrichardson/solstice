      "explanation": "A multi-panel summary of regulatory approvals (FDA, CDC, EMA/CHMP, Health Canada, PMDA Japan, TGA Australia) for a 45 \u00b5g/strain recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA) influenza vaccine versus standard 15 \u00b5g/strain egg-based vaccines, listing immunogenicity metrics (ELISA or HAI geometric mean titer ratios and fold increases). Evidence: FDA: ELISA rHA H1N1 1.64\u00d7, H3N2 1.38\u00d7, B 1.64\u00d7 versus standard egg vaccine; CDC: HAI GMT ratio 1.88\u20132.44; EMA/CHMP: superiority with GMT ratio >1.5; PMDA (Japan): \u22654-fold higher HAI GMT; TGA (Australia): HAI GMT ratio >2. The figure presents quantitative data from multiple regulatory authorities showing higher antibody titers induced by the higher-dose recombinant vaccine compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines, which supports the claim. Note: Image text is somewhat small but key immunogenicity metrics are legible; conclusions drawn directly from visible data."
