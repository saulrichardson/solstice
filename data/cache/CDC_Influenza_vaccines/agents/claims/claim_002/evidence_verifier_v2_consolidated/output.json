The left panel shows virus inoculation into embryonated hen eggs leading to egg-adaptive hemagglutinin mutations; the right panel shows virus propagation in mammalian cell cultures leading to cell-adaptive mutations. Evidence: Text in the figure explicitly notes that egg-based production can introduce egg-adaptive hemagglutinin mutations and cell-based production can introduce cell-adaptive mutations, both potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness. The figure shows that both egg- and cell-based vaccine production can lead to adaptive mutations that may reduce effectiveness, which supports the claim Note: Image text is clear but limited to schematic summary; no numerical data provided",
