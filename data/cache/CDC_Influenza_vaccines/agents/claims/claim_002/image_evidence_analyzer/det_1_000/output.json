  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular listing of U.S.-licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines, showing trade names (e.g., Flucelvax Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent, FluMist Quadrivalent), manufacturers, presentations (dose format), age indications, antigen content per dose, administration route, and mercury content if present. The table provides formulations and dosing details for different flu vaccines but does not mention the development of mutations during cell- or egg-based production or any impact on effectiveness; therefore, it does not support the claim.",
