  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various quadrivalent influenza vaccines by trade name and manufacturer, including inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4), a recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4), and an egg-based live attenuated vaccine (LAIV4). For each it shows presentation (e.g., prefilled syringe or intranasal sprayer), age indication, hemagglutinin (HA) content or virus count per dose, administration route, and mercury content. This table provides product specifications for different flu vaccines but does not mention the potential for mutations during cell- or egg-based production or any impact on effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The image contains only formulation and dosage details; no information on production-associated mutations or effectiveness is present.",
