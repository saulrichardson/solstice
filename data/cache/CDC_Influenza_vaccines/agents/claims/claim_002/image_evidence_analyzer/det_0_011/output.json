  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Figure with three schematic virus icons labeled \u201cAvian virus,\u201d \u201cCell-based vaccine,\u201d and \u201cEgg-based vaccine,\u201d each marked with an X or check. Below each is text describing how the vaccine virus is derived, highlighting that egg-based vaccine strains acquire egg-adaptive mutations that can alter antigenic sites. Evidence: Under the \u201cEgg-based vaccine\u201d column, text states that egg-adaptive mutations in haemagglutinin during production can lead to a mismatch with circulating strains and potentially reduce vaccine effectiveness. The figure shows evidence that egg-based vaccines can develop adaptive mutations that may reduce effectiveness but does not indicate that cell-based vaccines develop similar production mutations, so it does not support the claim for both cell- and egg-based vaccines. Note: Image resolution is low and text is small, but the key point about egg-adaptive mutations is legible; no evidence of cell-based vaccine mutations is shown.",
