  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products by type (standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent, cell culture\u2013based quadrivalent, high-dose egg-based), manufacturer, presentation formats (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe, multidose vial), age indications, hemagglutinin antigen content per dose, route of administration, and thimerosal content. The table provides product formulations and dosing details but contains no information about mutations arising during production or any impact on vaccine effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Based solely on this image, there is no mention of antigenic or production-related mutations; image quality is sufficient to confirm absence of relevant information.",
