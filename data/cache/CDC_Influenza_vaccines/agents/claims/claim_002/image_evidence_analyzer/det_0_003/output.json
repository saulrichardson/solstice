  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza vaccine products (egg-based and cell culture\u2013based), including vaccine names, presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe, multidose vial), age indications, antigen content per dose, administration route, and thimerosal content for standard-dose and high-dose formulations. The table provides product specifications for egg-based and cell culture-based flu vaccines but contains no information about mutations arising during production or effects on effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but limited to dosage and formulation details; no data on mutations or efficacy are presented.",
