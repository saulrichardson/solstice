      "explanation": "The quote 'Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5 mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM' appears in the document as 'Flublok Quad rival ent (San of i Pasteur) 0.5 mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM'. The wording is slightly altered due to OCR artifacts, but the factual content, including the product name, manufacturer, dose, age indication, and HA content, is preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok Quadrivalent contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL dose found in standard-dose flu vaccines, as also shown elsewhere in the document for other products. Therefore, the quote supports the first part of the claim regarding HA content. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim about greater immunogenicity, so it only partially supports the full claim.",

The wording is slightly altered due to OCR artifacts, but the factual content (vaccine name, manufacturer, dose, age, HA content, and route) is preserved.. The quote provides the HA antigen content (15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL) for a standard-dose flu vaccine (Fluzone Quadrivalent). This establishes the baseline for comparison with Flublok, which is listed elsewhere in the document as containing 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL.
