      "explanation": "The quote 'Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5 mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM' appears in the document with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' instead of 'Quadrivalent', spacing, and line breaks). The factual content, including the product name, manufacturer, dose, age indication, and HA content (45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL), is preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok Quadrivalent contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL dose listed for standard-dose flu vaccines elsewhere in the document (e.g., Fluzone Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent). Therefore, the quote supports the first part of the claim regarding HA content. However, the quote does not address immunogenicity or its comparison to standard-dose vaccines, so it only supports the HA content portion of the claim.",
