  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",

      "quote": "Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5 mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM",
      "explanation": "The quote 'Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5 mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM' appears in the document with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' instead of 'Quadrivalent', spacing, and line breaks). The factual content, including the product name, manufacturer, dose, age indication, and HA content (45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL), is preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok Quadrivalent contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL dose listed for standard-dose flu vaccines elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'Fluzone Quadrivalent ... 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL'). Therefore, the quote supports the first part of the claim regarding HA content. However, the quote does not address immunogenicity or its comparison to standard-dose vaccines, so it only supports the HA content portion of the claim."

      "explanation": "The quote 'Fluzone Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS\u2020\u2020 \u22656 mos\u2020\u2020 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM' is present in the document, though with minor OCR artifacts: 'Flu zone Quad rival ent (San of i Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS\u2020\u2020 \u22656 mos\u2020\u2020 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM'. The factual content, including the vaccine name, manufacturer, dose, age indication, and HA content, is preserved.. The quote provides the HA antigen content (15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL) for a standard-dose flu vaccine (Fluzone Quadrivalent). This establishes the baseline for comparison with Flublok, which is listed elsewhere in the document as containing 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL. Thus, the quote directly supports the part of the claim regarding standard-dose HA content, which is necessary to substantiate the '3x' comparison in the claim."
