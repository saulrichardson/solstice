Increased HA antigen content has been associated with greater immunogenicity compared with standard-dose vaccines.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 3 times the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines and directly links the increased HA content to greater immunogenicity, supporting both parts of the claim."
