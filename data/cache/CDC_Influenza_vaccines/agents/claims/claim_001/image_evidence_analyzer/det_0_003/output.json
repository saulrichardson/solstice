  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza vaccines (standard-dose egg-based IIV4, cell culture\u2013based IIV4, high-dose egg-based IIV4, etc.), their presentations (e.g., 0.5 mL prefilled syringe, 5 mL multidose vial), age indications, hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per dose for each vaccine virus (e.g., 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL for standard-dose, 60 \u00b5g/0.7 mL for high-dose), administration route, and thimerosal content. The image does not include any information about Flublok or its antigen content and therefore does not support the claim Note: Table appears to show only standard egg-based, cell-based, high-dose, and adjuvanted vaccines; Flublok (recombinant HA vaccine) is not listed in the visible portion",
