  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial table listing influenza vaccine products on page 1, including standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent vaccines (IIV4), cell culture\u2013based vaccines, and a high-dose egg-based vaccine, with columns for presentation, age indication, and hemagglutinin (HA) content per dose (e.g., 15 \u03bcg/0.5 mL, 60 \u03bcg/0.7 mL). The table does not include Flublok or any information indicating that a vaccine contains three times the HA antigen content of standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image shows only a portion of the full table and does not include Flublok or its antigen specifications.",
