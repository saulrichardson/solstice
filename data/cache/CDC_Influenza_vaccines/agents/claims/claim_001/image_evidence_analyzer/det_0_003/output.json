  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza vaccines (standard-dose egg-based IIV4, cell culture\u2013based IIV4, high-dose egg-based IIV4) with columns for trade name/manufacturer, presentations (dose formats), age indications, hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per dose, route of administration, and thimerosal content when present. The image does not support the claim because it does not include Flublok or any data showing its HA content relative to standard-dose vaccines, so it doesn\u2019t support the claim. Note: None",
