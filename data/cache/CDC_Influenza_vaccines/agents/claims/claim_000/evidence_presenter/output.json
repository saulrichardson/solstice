      "explanation": "Schematic diagram showing the workflow for Flublok\u2019s recombinant HA antigens, listing WHO/FDA-selected influenza strains (e.g., A/Michigan H1N1, A/Hong Kong H3N2, B/Phuket, B/Brisbane) and illustrating that Flublok produces HA proteins matching those exact strain sequences. Evidence: Diagram indicates Flublok uses recombinant HA proteins based on WHO- and FDA-selected strains, ensuring antigen sequences are identical to selected strains. The figure supports the claim by illustrating that Flublok\u2019s recombinant HA antigens are produced using the exact HA sequences of WHO- and FDA-selected strains, demonstrating identical antigenic match with selected flu strains. Note: This is a conceptual schematic and does not provide empirical immunogenicity or antigenicity assay data; it assumes sequence identity implies antigenic match."
