  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic diagram titled \u201cAdvantages of recombinant HA technology\u201d showing key process steps for Flublok production. On the left are bullets listing benefits (e.g., no egg-adaptive changes, elimination of animal\u2010sourced components, faster response to drift, potential for greater antigenic match). In the center is a flowchart from \u201cWHO/FDA strain selection\u201d through rHA sequence synthesis, recombinant baculovirus generation, expression, purification, formulation, filling/packaging, QA/QC, release, to Flublok. A timeline comparison (<2 weeks vs. >20 weeks) is shown below. Evidence: Bullet point: \u201cPotential for greater antigenic match versus egg-based vaccines\u201d and use of WHO/FDA selected strain sequences for rHA synthesis The figure illustrates a process that uses WHO/FDA selected strain sequences and highlights the potential for greater antigenic match, but it does not provide direct evidence that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with those strains. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Diagrammatic overview only; no empirical data confirming antigenic identity is shown.",
