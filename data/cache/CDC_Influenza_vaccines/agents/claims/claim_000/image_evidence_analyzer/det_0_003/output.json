  "explanation": "A tabular listing of various influenza vaccine products (standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose egg-based), detailing presentation formats (e.g., 0.5 mL PFS, multidose vial), age indications, micrograms of HA antigen per dose, route of administration, and thimerosal content. does not support the claim because the table only provides vaccine formulations, dosages, age indications, and excipient details; it contains no information on Flublok or its antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Note: Image appears to be a partial table and does not show any data on Flublok or antigenic matching; conclusions are limited to visible content.",
