  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-row table detailing various quadrivalent influenza vaccines (standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, and high-dose egg-based), their presentations, age indications, hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per dose, administration route, and thimerosal content. Visible entries include standard-dose egg-based vaccines with 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL HA per strain, cell culture\u2013based vaccines with the same HA content, and a high-dose egg-based vaccine with 60 \u00b5g/0.7 mL HA per strain for adults \u226565 years. The table does not include any information on Flublok or its antigen content, and thus it does not support the claim about Flublok containing 3\u00d7 the HA antigen content compared with standard-dose vaccines. does not support the claim Note: Image shows only part of the full vaccine table; Flublok (recombinant vaccine) is not visible in the provided segment.",
