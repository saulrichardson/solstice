  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza vaccines (standard-dose egg-based IIV4, cell culture\u2013based IIV4, high-dose egg-based IIV4) with entries for presentation formats, age indications, hemagglutinin antigen content per strain (\u00b5g/dose), route of administration, and thimerosal content if present. The image does not support the claim because it only provides vaccine formulations, dosages, routes, and preservative details and does not mention Flublok or demonstrate identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected strains. Note: Image is clear but truncated; no mention of Flublok or antigenic matching data is present, limiting evaluation to formulation details only.",
