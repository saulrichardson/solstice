      "explanation": "The quote 'Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5 mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM' appears in the document with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' instead of 'Quadrivalent', spacing, and line breaks), but all the key facts\u2014product name, manufacturer, dose, age indication, antigen content, and route\u2014are present and semantically identical.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL dose listed for standard-dose flu vaccines elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'Fluzone Quadrivalent ... 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL'). Therefore, the quote directly supports the first part of the claim regarding HA content. However, the quote does not address immunogenicity or its comparison to standard-dose vaccines, so it only supports the HA content portion of the claim.",
