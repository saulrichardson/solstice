      "original_explanation": "This quote identifies RIV4 as a recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine, which is relevant because recombinant technology is the basis for the claim about broader immune response and potential cross-protection. However, the document does not provide explicit statements or data about the breadth of immune response or cross-protection for recombinant vaccines, so this is the only directly relevant segment."
