      "explanation": "Figure showing structural mapping of hemagglutinin epitopes on drifted H3 strains and two panels: (A) immunogenicity data with epitope drift index (EDI) and comparison of immune responses to HA for recombinant HA vaccine versus traditional inactivated vaccine, and (B) cross-protection data in the 2014\u201315 mismatched A/H3N2 season comparing vaccine effectiveness of recombinant HA (blue curve) versus inactivated influenza vaccine (grey curve). Evidence: Panel B shows that recombinant HA vaccine achieved substantially higher effectiveness against mismatched A/H3N2 (approximately 60%) compared with inactivated vaccine (~10%), and Panel A shows broader epitope coverage (higher EDI) with recombinant HA. The immunogenicity and cross-protection data presented support the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection in a mismatch season, so this evidence supports the claim. Note: Some text and labels in the figure are small and partially obscured, but key data on epitope coverage and mismatched season effectiveness are legible."
