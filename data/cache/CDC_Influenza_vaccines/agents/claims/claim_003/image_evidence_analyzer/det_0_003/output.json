  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza vaccines (standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent, cell culture\u2013based quadrivalent, high-dose egg-based) with columns for product name/manufacturer, presentation (0.5 mL PFS, 5 mL MDV, etc.), age indication, antigen content per dose (\u00b5g per strain), administration route, and thimerosal content. The image only provides vaccine formulations, dosages, and administration details; it does not present any data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or recombinant technology. Therefore, the table does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and complete for the table content; no sections on immunogenicity or cross-protection are visible.",
