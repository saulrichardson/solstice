  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular overview of influenza vaccine products, listing vaccine names (egg-based standard-dose quadrivalent vaccines from various manufacturers, a cell culture-based quadrivalent vaccine, and a high-dose egg-based vaccine), their presentations (e.g., 0.5 mL prefilled syringes, multi-dose vials), age indications, hemagglutinin antigen content per dose, administration route, and thimerosal content. The image provides only formulation, dosage, and presentation details of various influenza vaccines and does not include any data or statements about recombinant technology eliciting broader immune responses or cross-protection. It does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear and legible; however, it does not cover immunogenicity or cross-protection outcomes.",
