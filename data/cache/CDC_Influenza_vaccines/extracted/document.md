* Manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC and ACIP guidance should be consulted for additional information
concerning, but not limited to, indications, contraindications, warnings, and precautions. Package inserts for U.S.-licensed
vaccines are available at https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/vaccines-licensed-use-united-states
.
Availability and characteristics of specific products and presentations might change or differ from what is described in this
table and in the text of this report.


Although a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to egg is a labeled contraindication to the use of egg-based
IIV4s and LAIV4, ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccine and
that any influenza vaccine (egg based or nonegg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health
status can be used (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy).
†

The approved dose volume for Afluria Quadrivalent is 0.25 mL for children aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL for
persons aged ≥3 years. However, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are no longer available. For children aged 6 through 35
months, a 0.25-mL dose must be obtained from a multidose vial.
§

IM-administered influenza vaccines should be administered by needle and syringe only, with the exception of the MDV
presentation of Afluria Quadrivalent, which may alternatively be given by the PharmaJet Stratis jet injector for persons ag
18 through 64 years only. For older children and adults, the recommended site for IM influenza vaccination is the deltoid
muscle. The preferred site for infants and young children is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. Additional specific
guidance regarding site selection and needle length for IM administration is available in the General Best Practice
Guidelines for Immunization available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/index.html.

0.25-mL prefilled syringes are no longer available. If a prefilled syringe of Fluzone Quadrivalent is used for a child in this
age group, the dose volume will be 0.5 mL per dose.
