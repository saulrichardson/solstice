      "quote": "The use of recombinant DNA techniques to express proteins cell culture has been a successful approach for generation of ghly effective vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B (HBV) nd human papilloma virus (HPV), and baculo virus expression tech- ology is currently used for a licensed HPV vaccine [26]. Among he available expression technologies, recombinant baculo virus is specially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because he rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this ector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expres- on of the HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculo virus so avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live flu enz a viruses, and the attendant bio containment issues that ould be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines 7]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect ells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for easonal influenza.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains the use of recombinant DNA and baculovirus expression technology to express HA protein in insect cells, supporting the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform involving BEVS in insect cells."
