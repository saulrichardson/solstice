      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor formatting and OCR differences: 'Genes were cloned into baculo virus using RT-PCR from the same Cd ce rived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed nactivated influenza vaccine for that year.' This is semantically equivalent to the provided quote, with 'Cd ce rived' being a split OCR version of 'CDC derived', and 'baculo virus' for 'baculovirus'. The factual content is preserved.. The quote directly states that the genes used for Flublok were cloned from the same CDC-derived vaccine seed viruses as those used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccines for that year. Since the CDC selects seed viruses based on WHO and FDA recommendations, this supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. The quote provides explicit evidence that the antigenic source material is the same, thus substantiating the claim.",

The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses.",
