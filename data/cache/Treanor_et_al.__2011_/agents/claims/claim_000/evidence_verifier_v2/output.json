The core content and meaning are identical to the quote provided.. The quote directly states that the genes used for Flublok were cloned from the same CDC-derived vaccine seed viruses as those used for licensed inactivated influenza vaccines for that year. This means that the antigenic composition of Flublok matches the strains selected by public health authorities (WHO and FDA), thus supporting the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with the selected flu strains.",
