      "explanation": "A very similar quote appears on page 2: 'The antigens used in the as says were baculo virus eri ved rHAs representing the A/Solomon Islands 03 2006 (H1 N1), /Wisconsin 67 2005 (H3 N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses, rovided by Protein Sciences Corporation.' The wording and content match the quote to verify, with only minor typographical differences.. The quote states that the antigens used in the assays (and, by context, in the Flublok vaccine) were recombinant hemagglutinins (rHAs) derived from the specific strains A/Solomon Islands/03/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004. These strains are the WHO- and FDA-selected strains for that influenza season. The quote also notes that the genes were cloned from the same CDC-derived vaccine seed viruses used for licensed inactivated influenza vaccines. This directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it uses the same genetic material to produce the antigens.",
