      "quote": "The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote details that Flublok contains hemagglutinin proteins derived from the exact strains recommended for the season, confirming the vaccine's antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected strains."
