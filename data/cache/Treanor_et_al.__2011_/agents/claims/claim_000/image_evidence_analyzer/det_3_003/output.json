  "explanation": "A table listing pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean antibody titers (with 95% confidence intervals) and percent response for placebo, Flublok, Flublok previously vaccinated (PV), and Flublok not previously vaccinated (NPV) groups across different influenza strains. does not support the claim because the table only presents immunogenicity data (antibody titers and response rates) and contains no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Note: Portion of table is visible and shows only immunogenicity metrics; no mention of strain selection or match was found.",
