  "explanation": "A table showing pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean hemagglutination inhibition titers (with 95% CIs) and percentage of responders for placebo, Flublok, and Flublok subgroups (previously vaccinated and not previously vaccinated). The table presents immunogenicity data (HI titers and response rates) and does not address or demonstrate antigenic match between Flublok and WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Only immunogenicity endpoints are shown; no direct information on antigenic composition or match is provided.",
