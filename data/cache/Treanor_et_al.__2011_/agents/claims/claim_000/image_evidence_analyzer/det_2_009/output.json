  "explanation": "A table showing the number and percentage of subjects reporting solicited adverse events (e.g., fever, malaise, chills, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, nausea, vomiting) by severity grade across different treatment groups does not support the claim because the table presents safety/adverse event data and contains no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains Note: Limited to safety data; no strain or antigenic matching information is present",
