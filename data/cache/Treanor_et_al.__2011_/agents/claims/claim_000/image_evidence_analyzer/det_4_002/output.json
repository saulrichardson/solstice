  "explanation": "Two Kaplan\u2013Meier plots of cumulative incidence of culture-positive CDC-ILI influenza A (top) and influenza B (bottom) cases over the 2007\u20132008 surveillance period. Solid lines represent placebo recipients and dashed lines represent FluBlok recipients, with dates on the x-axis and cumulative case incidence on the y-axis. Accompanying text reports numbers of cases, overall CDC-ILI rates, and calculated vaccine efficacy with 95% confidence intervals. does not support the claim because the figure and accompanying text present clinical incidence and efficacy data without any information on antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Note: Figure is limited to clinical efficacy curves; no antigenic characterization data are visible.",
