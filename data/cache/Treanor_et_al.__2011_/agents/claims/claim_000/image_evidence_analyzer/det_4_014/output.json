  "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table titled \u2018Table 2. Flublok recombinant HA amino acid sequence alignment to WHO and FDA vaccine strain recommendation\u2019, listing each WHO\u2010 or FDA\u2010selected influenza strain (by season and strain name) alongside the corresponding Flublok recombinant HA sequence data and indicating amino acid substitutions (none). Evidence: The table header and data rows show 100% sequence identity (exact antigenic match) between Flublok HA and WHO/FDA reference strains, with zero amino acid substitutions for every listed strain. Supports the claim because the table explicitly demonstrates an identical antigenic match between Flublok recombinant HA sequences and the WHO- and FDA-selected flu vaccine strains. Note: Minor image resolution limitations, but the header statement and zero substitution entries are clearly legible.",
