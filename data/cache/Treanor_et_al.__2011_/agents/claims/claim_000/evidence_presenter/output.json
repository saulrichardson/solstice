      "quote": "Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDC derived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor formatting and OCR differences: 'Genes were cloned into baculo virus using RT-PCR from the same Cd ce rived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed nactivated influenza vaccine for that year.' This matches the quoted content in meaning and technical detail.. The quote explicitly states that the genes used for Flublok were cloned from the same CDC-derived vaccine seed viruses as those used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccines for that year. Since the selection of these seed viruses is based on WHO and FDA recommendations, this directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. The quote provides direct evidence for the claim, without requiring inference."

      "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table titled \u2018Table 2. Flublok recombinant HA amino acid sequence alignment to WHO and FDA vaccine strain recommendation\u2019, listing each WHO\u2010 or FDA\u2010selected influenza strain (by season and strain name) alongside the corresponding Flublok recombinant HA sequence data and indicating amino acid substitutions (none). Evidence: The table header and data rows show 100% sequence identity (exact antigenic match) between Flublok HA and WHO/FDA reference strains, with zero amino acid substitutions for every listed strain. Supports the claim because the table explicitly demonstrates an identical antigenic match between Flublok recombinant HA sequences and the WHO- and FDA-selected flu vaccine strains. Note: Minor image resolution limitations, but the header statement and zero substitution entries are clearly legible."
