      "quote": "Flublok induced serum HAI antibody responses to all three components of the accine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vac- i nation geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all hree components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 or all comparisons).",
      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote supports the claim that Flublok's higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity, as evidenced by higher antibody titers compared to placebo."
