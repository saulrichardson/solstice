  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Top portion of the first page of a journal article from Vaccine (Elsevier), showing the journal header, URL, and the beginning of the article title about the protective efficacy of a trivalent recombinant hemagglutinin protein vaccine in healthy adults. The image does not provide any information about the amount of HA antigen in Flublok versus standard-dose flu vaccines and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Only the header and title of the article are visible; no quantitative antigen content or immunogenicity data are shown.",
