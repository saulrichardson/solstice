      "quote": "The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived influenza vaccines.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor differences in wording and formatting due to OCR cleanup. The key facts are present: Flublok is described as consisting of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system, and the trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg of each purified rHA0 component. The quote also references studies showing excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. The numbers, technical content, and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines (which contain 15 mcg per strain), as it states that Flublok contains 45 mcg per strain. It also references studies showing strong antibody responses, which is evidence of greater immunogenicity. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports both parts of the claim.",

      "quote": "More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9]. In the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults and adults 65 and older [3-5].",

      "original_explanation": "This passage references multiple studies that evaluated the immunogenicity of the rHA0 (Flublok) vaccine, noting consistently strong antibody responses, which supports the claim that the higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "Flublok induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 for all comparisons). The proportion of Flublok recipients with post vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99.5), 97% for the H3 component (95% CI, 94.6%, 98.3), and 78% for the B component (95% CI, 74.0%, 82.0).",
