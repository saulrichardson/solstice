      "quote": "The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived influenza vaccines.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok contains 45 mcg of each HA component, which is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines, and notes that this formulation has shown strong antibody responses, supporting the claim of higher antigen content and greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9]. In the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults and adults 65 and older [3-5].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This passage references studies of the rHA0 (Flublok) vaccine, which contains 3x the HA antigen, and directly states that these studies have shown strong antibody responses, supporting the link between higher HA content and greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "Flublok induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 for all comparisons). The proportion of Flublok recipients with post vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99.5), 97% for the H3 component (95% CI, 94.7%, 98.3), and 83% for the B component (95% CI, 80.0%, 85.7).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that Flublok, with its higher HA content, results in high rates of seroprotection and significantly higher antibody titers, supporting the claim that increased HA antigen is linked to greater immunogenicity."

      "relevance_explanation": "This reference to a dose-related study supports the claim that higher doses of HA antigen (as in Flublok) are associated with increased immunogenicity, as the study specifically examined the relationship between dose and immune response."
