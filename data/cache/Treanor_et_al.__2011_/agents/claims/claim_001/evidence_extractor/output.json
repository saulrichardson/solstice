These studies have consistently shown excellent to ler a bil yand antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived nfluenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy eval- ation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of ulture-positive CDC-defined influenza like illness compared with lacebo recipients, although the study was small [9]. In the present study, we performed amuch larger assessment fthe immunogen i city, safety, and protective efficacy of the final or mul ation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy",

As expected, post vac- i nation geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all hree components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 or all comparisons).",
