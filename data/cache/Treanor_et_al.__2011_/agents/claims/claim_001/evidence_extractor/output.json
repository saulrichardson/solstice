      "quote": "The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of puri- ed hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculo virus expression system as previously described [9]. The comb in ant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is fer red to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg smeasured by the single radial immuno diffusion as say of ch purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote specifies that Flublok contains 45 mcg of each hemagglutinin (HA) component, which is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines."

      "quote": "More recent stud- shave evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, ubjects aged 50\u201364 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older ,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent to ler a bil yand antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived nfluenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy eval- ation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of ulture-positive CDC-defined influenza like illness compared with lacebo recipients, although the study was small [9]. In the present study, we performed amuch larger assessment fthe immunogen i city, safety, and protective efficacy of the final or mul ation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy oung adults and adults 65 and older [3\u20135].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote discusses the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the rHA0 (Flublok) vaccine, supporting the claim that its higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "Flublok induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the accine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vac- i nation geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all hree components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 or all comparisons).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that Flublok's higher HA content results in substantially higher antibody titers, supporting the link between increased HA content and greater immunogenicity."
