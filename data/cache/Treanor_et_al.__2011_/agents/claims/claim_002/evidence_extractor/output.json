      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by stating that growth in eggs can select receptor variants, which are mutations that may not match circulating strains, potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness."

      "quote": "Estimates of overall in activated vaccine protective effec- tiveness are clearly impacted by antigenic differences between vaccine and circulating viruses, with highest levels of effectiveness reported for H1 viruses [25] and lowest levels for influenza B.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by indicating that antigenic differences (which can arise from mutations during production) between the vaccine and circulating viruses affect vaccine effectiveness."

      "quote": "Two recently published studies have evaluated egg grown in activated vaccines in healthy adults using a placebo controlled design during the 2007-2008 influenza season. In one study, conducted primarily in Europe, the overall efficacy of egg grown in activated vaccine against culture confirmed illness was 63%, and the lower 95% CI was 46.7% [18]. The predominant influenza A isolates in that study were H1 N1 viruses, which were mostly vaccine like.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that the effectiveness of egg-based vaccines can vary, which is relevant to the claim that mutations during production (such as those selected in eggs) may reduce effectiveness."
