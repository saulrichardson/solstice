      "quote": "Although embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production, growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that egg-based vaccine production can select for receptor variants that may not match circulating strains, supporting the claim that mutations can develop during production and reduce effectiveness."

      "quote": "Two recently published studies have evaluated egg grown inactivated vaccines in healthy adults using a placebo controlled design during the 2007-2008 influenza season. In one study, conducted primarily in Europe, the overall efficacy of egg grown inactivated vaccine against culture confirmed illness was 63%, and the lower 95% CI was 46.7% [18]. The predominant influenza A isolates in that study were H1N1 viruses, which were mostly vaccine like.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote references studies evaluating the effectiveness of egg-based vaccines and notes that even when the viruses were 'mostly vaccine like,' the efficacy was not complete, implying that changes during production (such as mutations) can impact effectiveness."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes the use of insect cells (cell-based production) and notes differences in protein processing, which is relevant to the claim that cell-based systems can introduce changes (mutations or modifications) that may affect vaccine effectiveness."

      "relevance_explanation": "This reference is cited in the context of discussing how mutations (amino acid substitutions) in the hemagglutinin protein can influence vaccine efficacy, directly supporting the claim that mutations during production can reduce effectiveness."
