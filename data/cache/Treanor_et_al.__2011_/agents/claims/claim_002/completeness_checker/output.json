The key factual content is present: 'Although embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg pro growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].' The extracted quote is semantically equivalent to the provided quote.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the process of growing influenza vaccines in eggs 'can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains.' This means that mutations or changes can occur during production, potentially making the vaccine less effective against the actual circulating viruses. This is exactly what the claim asserts: that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
