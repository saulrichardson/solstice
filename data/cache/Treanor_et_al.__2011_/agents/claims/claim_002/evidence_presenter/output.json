      "quote": "Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg pro- growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].",
      "explanation": "The quote appears almost verbatim in the first paragraph of the document: 'Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg pro- growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].' The only difference is a line break and a hyphen in 'pro- growth in eggs,' but the core content is identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that growth in eggs 'can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains.' This means that during production, mutations or selection of variants can occur, potentially making the vaccine less effective against the actual circulating strains. This is exactly what the claim asserts: that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production, reducing their effectiveness."

      "quote": "Wood JM, Oxford JS, Dun lea vy U, Newman RW, Major D, Robertson JS. Influenza A (H1 N1) vaccine efficacy in animal models is influenced by two amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin molecule. Virology 1989 171 214 21.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the references section on page 6 as: '2] Wood JM, Oxford JS, Dun lea vy U, Newman RW, Major D, Robertson JS. Influenza A (H1 N1) vaccine efficacy in animal models is influenced by two amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin molecule. Virology 1989 171 214 21.' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (spacing, punctuation, and line breaks).. The reference is cited in the context of discussing egg-based vaccine production and the potential for mutations. The title of the referenced article explicitly states that 'vaccine efficacy in animal models is influenced by two amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin molecule,' which directly supports the claim that mutations (amino acid substitutions) arising during production (such as in eggs or cells) can affect vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, this reference genuinely supports the claim."
