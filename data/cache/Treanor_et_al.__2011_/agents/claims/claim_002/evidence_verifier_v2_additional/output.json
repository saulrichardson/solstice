The core content and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that growing influenza viruses in eggs can 'select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains.' This means that mutations or changes can occur during egg-based production, potentially making the vaccine less effective against the actual circulating strains. This is exactly what the claim asserts: that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production, reducing their effectiveness.",
