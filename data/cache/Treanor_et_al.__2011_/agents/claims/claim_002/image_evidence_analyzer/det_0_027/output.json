  "explanation": "Text excerpt from the introduction of a vaccine study, describing the use of embryonated hen\u2019s eggs for influenza vaccine production and its logistical drawbacks (specialized facilities, limited scale-up, vulnerability to subtypes). The image does not support the claim because it only outlines general production challenges of egg-based vaccines and makes no mention of mutations arising during egg or cell culture or any impact on effectiveness. does not support the claim Note: Only introductory text is visible; no data or statements about viral mutations or reduced vaccine effectiveness are shown.",
