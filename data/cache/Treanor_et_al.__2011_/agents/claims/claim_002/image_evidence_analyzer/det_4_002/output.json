  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two Kaplan\u2013Meier plots showing cumulative incidence of culture\u2010positive CDC\u2010confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) for influenza A (top) and influenza B (bottom). Solid lines represent placebo group, and dashed lines represent Flublok (recombinant HA vaccine) recipients over time during the 2007\u20132008 surveillance period. The figure presents vaccine efficacy data comparing incidence of culture\u2010confirmed influenza in placebo versus Flublok groups; it does not present any information on production\u2010related mutations in cell- or egg-based vaccine manufacturing. Therefore, this evidence does not support the claim. Note: Figure is clear but limited to clinical incidence outcomes; no data on mutations during vaccine production are shown.",
