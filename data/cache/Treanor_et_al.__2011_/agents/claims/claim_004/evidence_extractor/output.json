      "quote": "Flublok induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 for all comparisons).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that the recombinant (Flublok) vaccine induced higher post-vaccination antibody titers compared to placebo, supporting the claim that it induces a robust antibody response."

      "id": 2,
      "quote": "Flublok induced serum HAI antibody responses to all three vaccine components in the majority of recipients, and the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for response rate exceeded the US FDA criteria for licensure for all three components (lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for response rate >40% and lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for HAI titer of 1:40 or greater >70%) [2].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that the recombinant vaccine (Flublok) meets or exceeds regulatory benchmarks for antibody response, indicating a robust immunogenicity."

      "quote": "More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50\u201364 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived influenza vaccines.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote notes that recombinant vaccines produce antibody responses at least similar to egg-based vaccines, supporting the claim of robust immunogenicity."

      "quote": "In the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults and adults 65 and older [3\u20135].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that the study is directly assessing the immunogenicity (antibody response) of the recombinant vaccine, which is relevant to the claim."

      "quote": "Reduced antibody response rates, decreased post vaccination titers, and decreased antibody secreting cell responses have all been observed previously in adults with prior influenza vaccine compared to those without [13\u201316]. The exact mechanism of this effect remains uncertain, although it may represent interference with antigen presentation by pre existing antibody [16].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides context that prior vaccination can blunt antibody responses, which is relevant when comparing robust responses between vaccine types and doses."
