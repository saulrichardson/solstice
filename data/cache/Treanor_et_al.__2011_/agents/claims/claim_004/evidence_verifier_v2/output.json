As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 for all comparisons).",

These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived influenza vaccines.",

At these sites, subjects had serum obtained prior to vaccination, and returned approximately 28 days after vaccination for assessment of serum antibody to influenza...
