As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 for all comparisons).",

      "original_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by indicating that recombinant HA produced in insect cells still generates an effective immune response, which is necessary for broad and cross-protective immunity."
