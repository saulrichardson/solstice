      "quote": "Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US during the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A viruses detected in this study were H3 N2 viruses that represented substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by stating that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) provided significant protection even in a season where the circulating strains were a substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine strains, indicating cross-protection."

      "quote": "The results of the current study support the utility of insect cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for seasonal influenza and supports that significant protection in a primed population can be obtained against influenza with a pure hemagglutinin vaccine.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote affirms that recombinant technology (using insect cells) can provide significant protection against influenza, supporting the idea of a broader immune response."

      "quote": "Flublok induced serum HAI antibody responses to all three vaccine components in the majority of recipients, and the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for response rate exceeded the US FDA criteria for licensure for all three components (lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for response rate >40% and lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for HAI titer of 1:40 or greater >70%) [2].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote demonstrates that the recombinant vaccine induced strong immune responses to multiple components, supporting the claim of a broader immune response."

      "quote": "Only 8 isolates in the study (<5% of the total) were antigenically identical to the strains contained in the vaccine. All of these viruses were A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like H3N2 viruses. Two of these occurred in Flublok recipients and 6 occurred in placebo recipients, and among these subjects one Flublok recipient and 5 placebo recipients met the CDC-ILI definition. Therefore, we were unable to obtain a meaningful estimate of the efficacy of Flublok against CDC-ILI due to strains represented in the vaccine. The remaining 111 influenza A viruses were characterized as antigenic variants, i.e., they exhibited a 4 fold or greater decrease in reactivity with post infection ferret antisera in reciprocal HAI testing.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that most circulating viruses were antigenic variants (mismatched), yet the study still assessed efficacy, supporting the idea that recombinant vaccines may provide cross-protection."
