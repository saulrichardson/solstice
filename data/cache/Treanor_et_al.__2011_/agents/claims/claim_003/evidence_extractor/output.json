      "quote": "Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US during the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A viruses detected in this study were H3N2 viruses that represented substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by stating that Flublok, a recombinant vaccine, provided significant protection even during a season when the circulating strains were a substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine strains, indicating cross-protection."

      "quote": "The results of the current study support the utility of insect cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for seasonal influenza and supports that significant protection in a primed population can be obtained against influenza with a pure hemagglutinin vaccine.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This statement affirms that recombinant technology (using insect cells) can produce effective vaccines that provide significant protection, implying a broad immune response."

      "quote": "The use of recombinant DNA techniques to express proteins in cell culture has been a successful approach for generation of highly effective vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV), and baculovirus expression technology is currently used for a licensed HPV vaccine [26]. Among the available expression technologies, recombinant baculovirus is especially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because the rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this vector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote highlights that recombinant technology allows for rapid updating of vaccines, which can help address mismatches and broaden immune responses to circulating strains."

      "quote": "Flublok induced serum HAI antibody responses to all three vaccine components in the majority of recipients, and the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for response rate exceeded the US FDA criteria for licensure for all three components (lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for response rate >40% and lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for HAI titer of 1:40 or greater >70%) [2].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that the recombinant vaccine induces strong immune responses to multiple components, supporting the idea of a broader immune response."

      "quote": "Only 8 isolates in the study (<5% of the total) were antigenically identical to the strains contained in the vaccine. All of these viruses were A/Wisconsin/67/2005 like H3N2 viruses. Two of these occurred in Flublok recipients and 6 occurred in placebo recipients, and among these subjects one Flublok recipient and 5 placebo recipients met the CDC-ILI definition. Therefore, we were unable to obtain a meaningful estimate of the efficacy of Flublok against CDC-ILI due to strains represented in the vaccine. The remaining 111 influenza A viruses were characterized as antigenic variants, i.e., they exhibited a 4 fold or greater decrease in reactivity with post infection ferret antisera in reciprocal HAI testing. These viruses included 12 H1N1 viruses antigenically resembling H1 drift variant A/Brisbane/59/2007, 41 H3N2 viruses antigenically resembling the H3 drift variant A/Brisbane/10/2007, 2 H3N2 viruses that could not be identified as either A/Wisconsin-like or A/Brisbane-like, and 16 influenza viruses for which the subtype was not determined. Fifty eight of the 59 influenza B viruses (98%) were antigenically similar to B/Florida/04/2006, presenting a different clade from the vaccine strain, and one influenza B virus could not be antigenically characterized.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This passage shows that most circulating viruses were antigenic variants (mismatched), yet the study still measured protective efficacy, supporting the claim that recombinant vaccines can provide cross-protection in mismatch seasons."
