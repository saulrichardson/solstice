      "quote": "The majority of influenza A viruses detected in this study were H3N2 viruses that represented a substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by stating that the recombinant vaccine (Flublok) provided significant protection even when there was a mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains, indicating cross-protection and a broader immune response."

      "quote": "Flublok induced serum HAI antibody responses to all three components of the vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 for all comparisons).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that recombinant technology (Flublok) induces strong immune responses to multiple influenza strains, supporting the idea of a broader immune response."

      "quote": "The results of the current study support the utility of insect cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for seasonal influenza.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote affirms the effectiveness of recombinant technology (using insect cells), which is foundational to the claim that such technology can provide broader and potentially cross-protective immune responses."
