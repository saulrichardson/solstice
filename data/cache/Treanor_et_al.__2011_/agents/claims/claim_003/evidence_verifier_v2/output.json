      "explanation": "A very close version of the quote appears on page 5: 'Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US during the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A viruses detected in this study were H3N2 viruses that represented a substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and phrasing.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that despite a substantial antigenic mismatch (i.e., the vaccine did not match the circulating strains well), the recombinant vaccine Flublok still provided significant protective efficacy against confirmed influenza illness. This demonstrates cross-protection and suggests a broader immune response, as the vaccine was effective even in a mismatch season.",
