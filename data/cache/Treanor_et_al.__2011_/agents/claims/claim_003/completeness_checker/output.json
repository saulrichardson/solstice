      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document: 'Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US during the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A viruses detected in this study were H3N2 viruses that represented substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that during a season with substantial antigenic mismatch (i.e., the vaccine did not match the circulating strains well), Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) still provided significant protective efficacy against influenza illness. This demonstrates cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim. The quote does not explicitly mention a 'broader immune response,' but it does provide direct evidence of cross-protection, which is the key point of the claim.",

      "quote": "Only 8 isolates in the study (<5% of the total) were antigenically identical to the strains contained in the vaccine. All of these viruses were A/Wisconsin/67/2005 like H3N2 viruses. Two of these occurred in Flublok recipients and 6 occurred in placebo recipients, and among these subjects one Flublok recipient and 5 placebo recipients met the CDC-ILI definition. Therefore, we were unable to obtain a meaningful estimate of the efficacy of Flublok against CDC-ILI due to strains represented in the vaccine. The remaining 111 influenza A viruses were characterized as antigenic variants, i.e., they exhibited a 4 fold or greater decrease in reactivity with post infection ferret antisera in reciprocal HAI testing. These viruses included 12 H1N1 viruses antigenically resembling H1 drift variant A/Brisbane/59/2007, 41 H3N2 viruses antigenically resembling the H3 drift variant A/Brisbane/10/2007, 2 H3N2 viruses that could not be identified as either A/Wisconsin-like or A/Brisbane-like, and 16 influenza viruses for which the subtype was not determined. Fifty eight of the 59 influenza B viruses (98%) were antigenically similar to B/Florida/04/2006, presenting a different clade from the vaccine strain, and one influenza B virus could not be antigenically characterized.",

This matches the quote to be verified.. The quote provides explicit data showing that the vast majority of influenza isolates in the study were antigenic variants (i.e., mismatched to the vaccine strains), and only a very small number matched the vaccine. The passage also notes that efficacy against matched strains could not be meaningfully estimated due to the low number of such cases, implying that any observed efficacy must be due to protection against mismatched (variant) strains. This directly supports the claim that recombinant technology (as used in Flublok) leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, because the vaccine showed efficacy despite the mismatch. The document does not explicitly state the mechanism (broader immune response), but the data provided in the quote substantiate the claim regarding cross-protection in a mismatch season.",
