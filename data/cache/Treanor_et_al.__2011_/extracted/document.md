### Although embryonated hen’seggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg pro growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].

The comb in ant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is fer red to as rHA0.

Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evalation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of ulture-positive CDC-defined influenza like illness compared with lacebo recipients, although the study was small [9].

iruses and with overall low attack rates [20], and 49.3% over two easons, 2005-2007 with most cases due to antigenic ally variant iruses [21]. Because of the difficulty in conducting placebo controlled tudies of influenza vaccine especially as the target groups for vac i nation have expanded, several recent assessments of influenza accine effectiveness have utilized a test negative, case control esign. Estimates of overall in activated vaccine protective effec-

yhich were mostly vaccine like. In another smaller study done on ollege campuses in Michigan [19], the protective efficacy of TIV gainst culture confirmed illness was 73% (95% CI, 51%, 85%). In hat study, 90% of influenza isolates were influenza A (H3 N2), but he antigenic characterization of isolates was not reported. In other ecent randomized trials, the protective efficacy of TIV was 22.3% the 2005-2006 influenza season predominated by influenza B

ub st anti ally lower than that against influenza A. Comparisons of these results with the results of other ssess men ts of the protective efficacy of influenza vaccines are omplica ted by differences in methodologies, populations, and nti genic match between vaccine and circulating strains in the pec if ic year that studies are carried out. Two recently published udies have evaluated egg grown in activated vaccines in healthy dults using a placebo controlled design during the 2007-2008 nfluenza season. In one study, conducted primarily in Europe, the ver all efficacy of egg grown in activated vaccine against culture on firmed illness was 63%, and the lower 95% CI was 46.7% [18]. The re dominant influenza A isolates in that study were H1 N1 viruses,

nti body [16]. Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US uring the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A iruses detected in this study were H3 N2 viruses that represented substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even nder these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective eff iacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition. Influenza B viruses isolated in his study and elsewhere in North America during the 2007-2008 eason belonged to the Yamagata lineage of influenza B viruses, gainst which vaccines representing the Victoria lineage would be xpected to have little or no efficacy. We also found that the eff iacy of Flublok against CDC-ILI associated with influenza B was ub st anti ally lower than that against influenza A.

eric ard it is has also been reported previously following vaccina on with licensed, egg derived influenza vaccine with a similar me course [11]. The mechanism and clinical significance of such nassociation is unclear. Flublok induced serum HAI antibody responses to all three vacne components in the majority of recipients, and the lower limit the 95% confidence interval for response rate exceeded the US DA criteria for licensure for all three components (lower limit of e 95% confidence interval for response rate >40% and lower limit the 95% confidence interval for HAI titer of 1:40 or greater >70%) 2]. Although we did not attempt to verify vaccine histories by view of medical records, significant differences in both the freuency and the magnitude of the HAI response were shown when omparing the immune response between subjects with self ported previous vaccination. Reduced antibody response rates, ecreased post vaccination titers, and decreased antibody secretgcell responses have all been observed previously in adults with rior influenza vaccine compared to those without [13 16. The xact mechanism of this effect remains uncertain, although it may present interference with antigen presentation by pre existing nti body [16].

baculo virus derived HA vaccine in adults for prevention of sea onal influenza and supports that significant protection in a primed opulation can be obtained against influenza with apure hemagutinin vaccine. The efficacy results also demonstrate that in dults, the minor differences in HA glycosylation seen in insect cells ompared to mammalian cells and the synthesis of the HA as an ncleaved precursor do not preclude the generation of an effective mmune response in adults. The use of recombinant DNA techniques to express proteins cell culture has been a successful approach for generation of ghly effective vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B (HBV) nd human papilloma virus (HPV), and baculo virus expression techology is currently used for a licensed HPV vaccine [26]. Among he available expression technologies, recombinant baculo virus is specially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because he rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this ector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expreson of the HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculo virus so avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live flu enz a viruses, and the attendant bio containment issues that ould be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines 7]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect ells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for easonal influenza.
