### Although embryonated hen’s eggs have been used to generate effective inﬂuenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg pro- growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating inﬂuenza strains [1,2].

We conducted this study to determine the protective efﬁcacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent inﬂuenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok®). Methods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injection of saline placebo (2304 subjects), or trivalent FluBlok containing 45 mcg of each rHA0 component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed

In addition, subjects from ﬁve sites (total, N = 870) part ici ated in a serological sub study. At these sites, subjects had serum btained prior to vaccination, and returned approximately 28 days fter vaccination for assessment of serum antibody to inﬂuenza

Vaccine The vaccine (FluBlok) used in this study consisted of puri- ed hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The comb in ant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is fer red to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg s measured by the single radial immuno diffusion as say of ach puriﬁed rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006

Finally, in a preliminary ﬁeld efﬁcacy eval- ation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of ulture-positive CDC-deﬁned inﬂuenza-like illness compared with lacebo recipients, although the study was small [9]. In the present study, we performed a much larger assessment f the immunogen i city, safety, and protective efﬁcacy of the ﬁnal or mul ation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy

iruses and with overall low attack rates [20], and 49.3% over two easons, 2005-2007 with most cases due to antigenic ally variant iruses [21]. Because of the difﬁculty in conducting placebo controlled tudies of inﬂuenza vaccine especially as the target groups for vac- i nation have expanded, several recent assessments of inﬂuenza accine effectiveness have utilized a test negative, case control esign. Estimates of overall in activated vaccine protective effec-

which were mostly vaccine like. In another smaller study done on ollege campuses in Michigan [19], the protective efﬁcacy of TIV gainst culture conﬁrmed illness was 73% (95% CI, 51%, 85%). In hat study, 90% of inﬂuenza isolates were inﬂuenza A (H3N2), but he antigenic characterization of isolates was not reported. In other ecent randomized trials, the protective efﬁcacy of TIV was 22.3% n the 2005-2006 inﬂuenza season predominated by inﬂuenza B

Comparisons of these results with the results of other ssessments of the protective efﬁcacy of inﬂuenza vaccines are omplicated by differences in methodologies, populations, and ntigenic match between vaccine and circulating strains in the peciﬁc year that studies are carried out. Two recently published tudies have evaluated egg grown in activated vaccines in healthy dults using a placebo controlled design during the 2007-2008 nﬂuenza season. In one study, conducted primarily in Europe, the ver all efﬁcacy of egg grown in activated vaccine against culture onﬁrmed illness was 63%, and the lower 95% CI was 46.7% [18]. The redominant inﬂuenza A isolates in that study were H1N1 viruses,

Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US uring the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of inﬂuenza A iruses detected in this study were H3N2 viruses that represented substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even nder these circumstances, FluBlok had sign i cant protective efﬁ- acy against culture-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case deﬁnition. Inﬂuenza B viruses isolated in his study and elsewhere in North America during the 2007-2008 eason belonged to the Yamagata lineage of inﬂuenza B viruses, gainst which vaccines representing the Victoria lineage would be xpected to have little or no efﬁcacy. We also found that the efﬁ- acy of FluBlok against CDC-ILI associated with inﬂuenza B was b t ti ll l th th t i t i ﬂ A

on with licensed, egg derived inﬂuenza vaccine with a similar me course [11]. The mechanism and clinical signiﬁcance of such n association is unclear. FluBlok induced serum HAI antibody responses to all three vac- ne components in the majority of recipients, and the lower limit f the 95% conﬁdence interval for response rate exceeded the US DA criteria for licensure for all three components (lower limit of he 95% conﬁdence interval for response rate >40% and lower limit f the 95% conﬁdence interval for HAI titer of 1:40 or greater >70%) 2]. Although we did not attempt to verify vaccine histories by eview of medical records, sign i cant differences in both the fre- uency and the magnitude of the HAI response were shown when omparing the immune response between subjects with self- eported previous vaccination. Reduced antibody response rates, ecreased post vaccination titers, and decreased antibody secret- g cell responses have all been observed previously in adults with rior inﬂuenza vaccine compared to those without [13 16. The xact mechanism of this effect remains uncertain, although it may epresent interference with antigen presentation by pre existing nti body [16]

onal inﬂuenza and supports that sign i cant protection in a primed opulation can be obtained against inﬂuenza with a pure he mag utinin vaccine. The efﬁcacy results also demonstrate that in dults, the minor differences in HA glycosylation seen in insect cells ompared to mammalian cells and the synthesis of the HA as an ncleaved precursor do not preclude the generation of an effective mmune response in adults. The use of recombinant DNA techniques to express proteins n cell culture has been a successful approach for generation of ighly effective vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B (HBV) nd human papillomavirus (HPV), and baculovirus expression tech- ology is currently used for a licensed HPV vaccine [26]. Among he available expression technologies, recombinant baculovirus is specially well suited for production of inﬂuenza vaccine because he rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this ector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expres- on of the HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus so avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live nﬂuenza viruses, and the attendant bio containment issues that would be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines 27]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect ells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for easonal inﬂuenza.
