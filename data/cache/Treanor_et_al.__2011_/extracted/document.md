 (mid

 with
eekly
 phone

 and
 instructed
 to

A total
 of
 582
 subjects
 were
 cultured
 for
 respiratory
 illness,
 and
nﬂuenza
 virus
 was
 isolated
 from
 178
 subjects.
 There
 were
 a
 total
f
 120
 subjects
 from
 whom
 inﬂuenza
 A
 was
 isolated,
 the
 majority
f
 whom
 (82/120,
 68%)
 met
 the
 CDC-ILI
 case
 deﬁnition.
 There
 were
total
 of
 59
 subjects
 with
 positive
 cultures
 for
 inﬂuenza
 B,
 and
 the
majority
 of
 these
 subjects
 (41/59,
 69%)
 also
 met
 the
 CDC-ILI
 case
eﬁnition.
Only
 8
 isolates
 in
 the
 study
 (<5%
 of
 the
 total)
 were
 antigeni-
ally
 identical
 to
 the
 strains
 contained
 in
 the
 vaccine.
 All
 of
 these
iruses
 were
 A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like
 H3N2
 viruses.
 Two
 of
 these
ccurred
 in
 FluBlok
 recipients
 and
 6
 occurred
 in
 placebo
 recipi-
nts,
 and
 among
 these
 subjects
 one
 FluBlok
 recipient
 and
 5
 placebo
ecipients
 met
 the
 CDC-ILI
 deﬁnition.
 Therefore,
 we
 were
 unable
o
 obtain
 a
 meaningful
 estimate
 of
 the
 efﬁcacy
 of
 FluBlok
 against
DC-ILI
 due
 to
 strains
 represented
 in
 the
 vaccine.
The
 remaining
 111
 inﬂuenza
 A
 viruses
 were
 characterized
 as
ntigenic
 variants,
 i.e.,
 they
 exhibited
 a
 4-fold
 or
 greater
 decrease
n
 reactivity
 with
 post
 infection
 ferret
 antisera
 in
 reciprocal
 HAI
esting.
 These
 viruses
 included
 12
 H1N1
 viruses
 antigenically
esembling
 H1
 drift
 variant
 A/Brisbane/59/2007,
 41
 H3N2
 viruses
ntigenically
 resembling
 the
 H3
 drift
 variant
 A/Brisbane/10/2007,
2
 H3N2
 viruses
 that
 could
 not
 be
 identiﬁed
 as
 either
 A/Wisconsin-
ke
 or
 A/Brisbane-like,
 and
 16
 inﬂuenza
 viruses
 for
 which
 the
ubtype
 was
 not
 determined.
 Fifty-eight
 of
 the
 59
 inﬂuenza
 B
iruses
 (98%)
 were
 antigenically
 similar
 to
 B/Florida/04/2006,
epresenting
 a
 different
 clade
 from
 the
 vaccine
 strain,
 and
 one
nﬂuenza
 B
 virus
 could
 not
 be
 antigenically
 characterized.
The
 cumulative
 rates
 of
 culture
 conﬁrmed
 inﬂuenza
 illness
ccurring
 in
 the
 study
 population
 over
 time
 are
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 2,
which
 shows
 that
 the
 relative
 difference
 between
 the
 two
 study
roups
 remained
 constant
 throughout
 the
 inﬂuenza
 season.
 The
ncidence
 of
 this
 and
 of
 other
 related
 endpoints
 in
 the
 study

 are
 shown
 in
 Table

 The
 overall
 protective
 efﬁcacy
 of
luBlok
 against
 culture
 positive
 CDC-ILI
 regardless
 of
 strain
 was
4.6%
 (95%
 CI
 18.8%,
 62.6%).
 As
 expected
 given
 the
 more
 extreme
egree
 of
 antigenic
 mismatch
 for
 the
 inﬂuenza
 B
 component,
 the
fﬁcacy
 of
 FluBlok
 was
 greater
 against
 CDC-ILI
 due
 to
 inﬂuenza
 A
iruses
 (54.4%)
 than
 inﬂuenza
 B
 viruses
 (23.1%),
 although
 the
 differ-
nce
 was
 not
 statistically
 signiﬁcant
 (P
 =

 by
 logistic
 regression).
owever,
 we  were
 not
 able
 to
 demonstrate
 a
 statistically
 signiﬁcant
ffect
 for
 inﬂuenza
 B.
 As
 shown
 in
 Table

 there
 were
 no
 sub-

 system
n
 healthy

 [9].  These
 vaccines
 have
 been
 well
 tolerated
 at
 all
oses
 administered,
 and
 are
 associated
 with
 low
 rates
 of
 local

ons.
 One
 case
 of
 pericarditis
 was
 detected
 in
 a
 FluBlok
 recipient.
ericarditis
 has
 also
 been
 reported
 previously
 following
 vaccina-
on
 with
 licensed,
 egg-derived
 inﬂuenza
 vaccine
 with
 a
 similar
me
 course
 [11].
 The
 mechanism
 and
 clinical
 signiﬁcance
 of
 such
n
 association
 is
 unclear.
FluBlok
 induced
 serum
 HAI
 antibody
 responses
 to
 all
 three
 vac-
ne
 components
 in
 the
 majority
 of
 recipients,
 and
 the
 lower
 limit
f
 the
 95%
 conﬁdence
 interval
 for
 response
 rate
 exceeded
 the
 US
DA
 criteria
 for
 licensure
 for
 all
 three
 components
 (lower

 of
he
 95%
 conﬁdence
 interval
 for
 response
 rate
 >40%
 and
 lower
 limit
f
 the
 95%
 conﬁdence
 interval
 for
 HAI
 titer
 of

 or
 greater
 >70%)
2].
Although
 we
 did
 not
 attempt
 to
 verify
 vaccine
 histories
 by
eview
 of
 medical
 records,
 signiﬁcant
 differences
 in
 both
 the
 fre-
uency
 and
 the
 magnitude
 of
 the
 HAI
 response
 were
 shown
 when
omparing
 the
 immune
 response
 between
 subjects
 with
 self-
eported
 previous
 vaccination.
 Reduced
 antibody
 response
 rates,
ecreased
 post
 vaccination
 titers,
 and
 decreased
 antibody
 secret-
ng
 cell
 responses
 have
 all
 been
 observed
 previously
 in
 adults
 with
rior
 inﬂuenza
 vaccine
 compared
 to
 those
 without
 [13–16].
 The
xact
 mechanism
 of
 this
 effect
 remains
 uncertain,
 although
 it
 may
epresent
 interference
 with
 antigen
 presentation
 by
 pre-existing
ntibody
 [16].
Consistent
 with
 the
 results
 of
 national
 surveillance
 in
 the
 US
uring
 the
 2007–2008
 season
 [17], the
 majority
 of
 inﬂuenza
 A
ruses
 detected
 in
 this
 study
 were
 H3N2
 viruses
 that
 represented
substantial
 antigenic
 mismatch
 with
 the
 vaccine.
 However,
 even
nder
 these
 circumstances,
 FluBlok
 had
 signiﬁcant
 protective
 efﬁ-
acy
 against
 culture-conﬁrmed
 inﬂuenza
 illness,
 including
 those
meeting
 the
 CDC-ILI
 case
 deﬁnition.
 Inﬂuenza
 B
 viruses
 isolated
 in
his
 study
 and
 elsewhere
 in
 North
 America
 during
 the
 2007–2008
eason
 belonged
 to
 the
 Yamagata
 lineage
 of
 inﬂuenza
 B
 viruses,
gainst
 which
 vaccines
 representing
 the
 Victoria
 lineage
 would
 be
xpected
 to
 have
 little
 or
 no
 efﬁcacy.
 We  also
 found
 that
 the
 efﬁ-
acy
 of
 FluBlok
 against
 CDC-ILI
 associated
 with
 inﬂuenza
 B
 was
ubstantially
 lower
 than
 that
 against
 inﬂuenza
 A.
Comparisons
 
of
 
these
 
results
 
with
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
other
ssessments
 of
 the
 protective
 efﬁcacy
 of
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 are
omplicated
 by
 differences
 in
 methodologies,
 populations,
 and
ntigenic
 match
 between
 vaccine
 and
 circulating
 strains
 in
 the
peciﬁc
 year
 that
 studies
 are
 carried
 out.
 Two
 recently
 published
udies
 have
 evaluated
 egg-grown
 inactivated
 vaccines
 in
 healthy
dults
 using
 a
 placebo-controlled
 design
 during
 the
 2007–2008
nﬂuenza
 season.
 In
 one
 study,
 conducted
 primarily
 in
 Europe,
 the
verall
 efﬁcacy
 of
 egg-grown
 inactivated
 vaccine
 against
 culture
onﬁrmed
 illness
 was
 63%,
 and
 the
 lower
 95%
 CI
 was
 46.7%
 [18].
 The
redominant
 inﬂuenza
 A
 isolates
 in
 that
 study
 were
 H1N1
 viruses,
which
 were
 mostly
 vaccine-like.
 In
 another
 smaller
 study
 done
 on
ollege
 campuses
 in
 Michigan
 [19], the
 protective
 efﬁcacy
 of
 TIV
gainst
 culture
 conﬁrmed
 illness
 was
 73%
 (95%
 CI,
 51%,
 85%).
 In
hat
 study,
 90%
 of
 inﬂuenza
 isolates
 were
 inﬂuenza
 A
 (H3N2),
 but
he
 antigenic
 characterization
 of
 isolates
 was
 not
 reported.
 In
 other
ecent
 randomized
 trials,
 the
 protective
 efﬁcacy
 of
 TIV
 was
 22.3%
n
 the
 2005–2006
 inﬂuenza
 season
 predominated
 by
 inﬂuenza
 B
ruses
 and
 with
 overall
 low
 attack
 rates
 [20], and
 49.3%
 over
 two
easons,
 2005–2007
 with
 most
 cases
 due
 to
 antigenically
 variant
ruses
 [21].
Because
 of
 the
 difﬁculty
 in
 conducting
 placebo-controlled
udies
 of
 inﬂuenza
 vaccine
 especially
 as
 the
 target
 groups
 for
 vac-
nation
 have
 expanded,
 several
 recent
 assessments
 of
 inﬂuenza
accine
 effectiveness
 have
 utilized
 a
 test-negative,
 case–control
esign.
 Estimates
 of
 overall
 inactivated

 protective
 effec-
veness
 in
 these

 have
 ranged

irculating
 viruses,
 with
 highest
 levels
 of
 effectiveness
 reported
 for
H1
 viruses
 [25]
 and
 lowest
 levels
 for
 inﬂuenza
 B.
The
 current
 study
 provides
 evidence
 of
 protective
 efﬁcacy
 of
baculovirus-derived
 HA
 vaccine
 in
 adults
 for
 prevention
 of
 sea-
onal
 inﬂuenza
 and
 supports
 that
 signiﬁcant
 protection
 in
 a
 primed
opulation
 can
 be
 obtained
 against
 inﬂuenza
 with
 a
 pure
 hemag-
lutinin
 vaccine.
 The
 efﬁcacy
 results
 also
 demonstrate
 that
 in
dults,
 the
 minor
 differences
 in
 HA
 glycosylation
 seen
 in
 insect
 cells
ompared
 to
 mammalian
 cells
 and
 the
 synthesis
 of
 the
 HA
 as
 an
ncleaved
 precursor
 do
 not
 preclude
 the
 generation
 of
 an
 effective
mmune
 response
 in
 adults.
The
 use
 of
 recombinant
 DNA
 techniques
 to
 express
 proteins
n
 cell
 culture
 has
 been
 a
 successful
 approach
 for
 generation
 of
ighly
 effective
 vaccines
 for
 the
 prevention
 of
 hepatitis
 B
 (HBV)
nd
 human
 papillomavirus
 (HPV),
 and
 baculovirus
 expression
 tech-
ology
 is
 currently
 used
 for
 a
 licensed
 HPV
 vaccine
 [26].
 Among
he
 available
 expression
 technologies,
 recombinant
 baculovirus
 is
specially
 well
 suited
 for
 production
 of
 inﬂuenza
 vaccine
 because
he
 rapidity
 with
 which
 genes
 can
 be
 cloned
 and
 inserted
 into
 this
ector
 facilitates
 updating
 the
 vaccine
 at
 regular
 intervals.
 Expres-
ion
 of
 the
 HA
 protein
 in
 insect
 cells
 using
 recombinant
 baculovirus
lso
 avoids
 the
 need
 to
 work
 with
 potentially
 pathogenic,
 live
nﬂuenza
 viruses,
 and
 the
 attendant
 biocontainment
 issues
 that
would
 be
 a
 particular
 concern
 for
 production
 of
 pandemic
 vaccines
27].
 The
 results
 of
 the
 current
 study
 support
 the
 utility
 of
 insect
ells
 for
 the
 production
 of
 well
 tolerated
 and
 effective
 vaccines
 for
easonal
 inﬂuenza.
