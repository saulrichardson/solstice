The wording and factual content are preserved, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, possible OCR artifacts).. The quote directly states that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO, which explicitly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. The quote also emphasizes the 'known and exact antigen content' of Flublok, reinforcing the claim about precise strain matching.",
