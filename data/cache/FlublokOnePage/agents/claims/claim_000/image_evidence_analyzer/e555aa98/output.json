The image does not support the claim because it contains only manufacturing and dosage information without any mention of antigenic match or alignment with WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The image is a partial capture and does not present any data on antigenic matching; visibility is limited to manufacturing details.",
