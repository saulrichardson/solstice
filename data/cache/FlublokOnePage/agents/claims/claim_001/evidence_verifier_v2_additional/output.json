      "explanation": "The quote 'in January 2024, vaccination with a higher dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg based standard dose vaccines.' appears in the document with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'amore' instead of 'a more'). The factual content and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly states that a higher dose recombinant flu vaccine (which refers to Flublok, as established elsewhere in the document) may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose, egg-based vaccines. This supports the claim that increased HA antigen content (3x in Flublok) is associated with greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines.",
