  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial figure showing decorative blue icons (a molecule-like structure and a DNA helix) and fragmentary text on the right with words like \u201cknown,\u201d \u201censure,\u201d and \u201cFDA,\u201d but no clear data, tables, or statements about Flublok or hemagglutinin antigen content. does not support the claim because the image provides no information or data regarding Flublok\u2019s HA antigen content or comparative immunogenicity versus standard-dose vaccines Note: Limited image quality and cropped content; appears to be a decorative slide fragment with no substantive clinical data",
