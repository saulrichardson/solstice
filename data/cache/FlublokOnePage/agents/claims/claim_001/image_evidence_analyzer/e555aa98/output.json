  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial text excerpt from a clinical document describing a recombinant influenza vaccine produced using BEVS technology, stating that the approved vaccine \u201ccontains 45 micrograms\u201d of hemagglutinin per strain, with reference to the CDC. Evidence: The image states the vaccine contains 45 micrograms of HA antigen per strain. The excerpt confirms a HA content of 45 micrograms but provides no direct comparison to the 15 microgram standard-dose vaccines or data on immunogenicity, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Text is partially cut off and context is limited, but no direct comparison or immunogenicity data are visible.",
