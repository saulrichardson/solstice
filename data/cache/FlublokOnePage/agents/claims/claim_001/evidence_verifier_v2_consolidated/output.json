The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting and spacing differences due to OCR artifacts.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines and explicitly links this higher antigen content to greater immunogenicity. This matches both parts of the claim, providing clear and direct support.",

      "explanation": "The quote 'in January 2024, vaccination with a higher dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg based standard dose vaccines.' appears in the document with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'amore' instead of 'a more'). The factual content and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly states that a higher dose recombinant flu vaccine (which refers to Flublok, as established elsewhere in the document) may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose, egg-based vaccines. This supports the claim that increased HA antigen content (3x in Flublok) is associated with greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines.",
