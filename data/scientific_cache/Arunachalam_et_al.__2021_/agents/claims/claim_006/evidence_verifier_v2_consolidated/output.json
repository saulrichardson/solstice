RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.",

Evidence: The diagram shows insertion of the HA gene into a baculovirus (BV) expression vector under a polyhedrin promoter and subsequent infection and expansion of cells in a bioreactor, indicating use of BEVS to express recombinant HA. The figure supports the claim by directly illustrating a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is generated via a baculovirus expression vector system in cell culture and then purified, thereby supporting the claim. Note: The figure does not explicitly label the cultured cells as insect cells, but the use of a baculovirus vector and polyhedrin promoter strongly implies insect cell expression.",
