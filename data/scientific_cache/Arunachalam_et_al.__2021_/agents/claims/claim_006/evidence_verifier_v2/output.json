      "quote": "RECOMBINANT HA EXPRESSION SYSTEMS Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been used for the manufacture of rHA vaccine antigens. The first candidate recombinant influenza vaccines to be successfully manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA protein genetically fused with the Toll like receptor 5 agonist, Salmonella typhimurium flagellin type 229. The resultant vaccines elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse models 29. In Phase 1 clinical evaluation, a prototypic quadrivalent vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune responses in healthy adults with favourable tolerability 30. The E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high yields of rHA (200 mg/L of purified HA protein) using a minimal number of bioreactors 31. The authors projected that the strategy could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a medium scale pharmaceutical production facility 31. This approach will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process 32. However, E. coli expressed rHA proteins can be subject to misfolding, contain impurities (e.g., host cell proteins), and do not undergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive processing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native conformation 31. The resulting processed proteins are less immunogenic than egg derived antigens, with around a 10 fold greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in animal models 31. These inherent complications have prevented large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of E. coli expressed influenza vaccines. Vaccines containing plant derived rHA either in soluble form or in virus like particles (VLPs) have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans 34 37. A plant derived recombinant quadrivalent VLP (QVLP) at 30 \u00b5g dose per strain was found to be non inferior in terms of vaccine efficacy against respiratory illness and influenza like illness to a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quadrivalent, GlaxoSmithKline) given at 15 \u00b5g dose strain in adults aged 18 to 64 years 37. However, inconsistency in the expression levels of target proteins, due to non specific integration of transgene(s) into the host genome, has been a major challenge with plant based expression systems 34. The unpredictable yield could adversely impact timely vaccine production, which typically involves updating at least one HA component of the vaccine to reflect antigenic change in the circulating influenza viruses each season. A unique positive attribute of plant derived rHA is that it can stimulate innate immunity that predominantly facilitates Type 1 proinflammatory cellular immune responses, potentially as a direct effect of the plant origin lipids/glycolipids in the vaccine formulation 38. These stimulatory components in a plant derived vaccine may need to be controlled and kept at a constant level, for commercialisation, to avoid potential severe adverse events caused by enhanced immune responses in vaccinees. Several groups have explored the use of adenovirus (AdV), primarily as a replication defective vector, for gene delivery and transgene expression of rHA in the host cells. AdV vectors induce both cell mediated and humoral immunity against the expressed protein providing robust protection against the targeted terms of specific structural features, the nature of the source material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on certain aspects of vaccine safety and efficacy (Fig. 2). Based on these unique features RIV4 received 'product exclusivity' protection.",
