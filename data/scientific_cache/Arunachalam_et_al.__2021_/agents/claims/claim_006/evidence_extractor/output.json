      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system, directly supporting the claim."

Cleaved fusion peptides (green) and complex glycans eliminate and mask unique epitopes on HA respectively. b Recombinant HA protein (shown as monomer) expressed in insect cells.",

      "quote": "Insect cell derived rHA (RIV4) has been studied extensively by various groups in both preclinical models and humans. The rHA contained in RIV4 differs from that expressed in other systems in terms of specific structural features, the nature of the source material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on certain aspects of vaccine safety and efficacy (Fig. 2).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote affirms that RIV4 (Flublok) uses insect cell-derived recombinant HA, emphasizing the unique manufacturing process involving insect cells."
