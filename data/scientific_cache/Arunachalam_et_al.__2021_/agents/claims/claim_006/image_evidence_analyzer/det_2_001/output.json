  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A schematic workflow showing PCR cloning of full-length HA cDNA into a transfer plasmid under a polyhedrin promoter, recombination with linearized baculovirus (BV) DNA to generate a BV expression vector containing the HA gene, followed by insect cell seeding, infection with the virus bank, expansion in a bioreactor, harvest (disc-stack centrifugation), extraction, clarification (depth filtration), and downstream purification (capture, polish, DNA removal, TFF/formulation). Evidence: Labels indicating \u2018\u2018BV expression vector,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018polyhedrin promoter,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018infect with Virus bank\u2019\u2019 along with insect cell bioreactor expansion demonstrate use of a baculovirus expression vector system to produce recombinant HA in insect cells. The figure supports the claim by explicitly depicting recombinant HA expression in insect cells via a baculovirus expression vector system under a polyhedrin promoter and subsequent bioreactor production steps, which supports the claim.",
