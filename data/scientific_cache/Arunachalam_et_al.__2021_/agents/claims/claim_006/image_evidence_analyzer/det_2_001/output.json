  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the production of recombinant HA using a baculovirus expression vector system: full-length HA cDNA is cloned into a transfer plasmid under a polyhedrin promoter, recombined into linearized baculovirus DNA to produce a BV expression vector carrying the HA gene, which is used to infect cells in a bioreactor; followed by harvest (disc-stack centrifugation), extraction, clarification (depth filtration), purification (capture, polishing, DNA removal), and TFF/formulation. Evidence: The diagram shows insertion of the HA gene into a baculovirus (BV) expression vector under a polyhedrin promoter and subsequent infection and expansion of cells in a bioreactor, indicating use of BEVS to express recombinant HA. The figure supports the claim by directly illustrating a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is generated via a baculovirus expression vector system in cell culture and then purified, thereby supporting the claim. Note: The figure does not explicitly label the cultured cells as insect cells, but the use of a baculovirus vector and polyhedrin promoter strongly implies insect cell expression.",
