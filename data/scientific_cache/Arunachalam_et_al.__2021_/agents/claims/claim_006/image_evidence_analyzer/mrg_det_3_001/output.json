  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two-panel schematic of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein structures. Panel a shows cleaved HA1 and HA2 subunits with polysialylated complex N-glycans attached at multiple sites and a cleaved fusion peptide. Panel b shows an uncleaved HA0 monomer with paucimannose-type N-glycans and an intact fusion peptide. The figure illustrates glycosylation differences between HA produced in different systems but makes no mention of Flublok, insect cells, or a baculovirus expression vector system. It doesn't support the claim. Note: Interpretation limited by lack of caption context; glycan structures imply insect-cell production but are not explicitly linked to BEVS or Flublok.",
