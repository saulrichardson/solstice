  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A two\u2010panel schematic comparing native influenza HA (panel a) and recombinant HA (rHA) produced in insect cells (panel b). Panel a shows HA1 and HA2 subunits with sialylated complex N\u2010linked glycans and a cleaved fusion peptide. Panel b shows a single HA0 precursor with uncleaved fusion peptide and simpler paucimannosidic glycans, labeled as produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system. Evidence: Caption explicitly states: \u201cStructural features of native HA expressed on influenza virus and rHA produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system.\u201d The figure\u2019s caption and labels describe rHA production in insect cells via a baculovirus expression vector system, which supports the claim that Flublok is produced using this novel platform.",
