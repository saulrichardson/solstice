  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Diagram of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein structures comparing fully processed HA (cleaved into HA1 and HA2) with polysialylated complex glycans (panel a) versus uncleaved HA0 carrying paucimannose glycans (panel b). Both panels show the globular head, fibrous stem, glycan structures, disulfide bonds, and fusion peptide regions. The figure illustrates differences in glycosylation between HA produced in different systems (complex polysialylated versus paucimannose glycans) and shows uncleaved versus cleaved HA, but it does not mention Flublok, baculovirus, or explicitly describe a BEVS platform. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The figure context suggests insect-cell glycosylation, but absence of any reference to BEVS or Flublok limits direct support; image quality and cut\u2010off caption could omit text.",
