      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly and explicitly supports the claim. It states that Flublok (RIV4) is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). This matches the claim exactly, with no need for inference or assumption. The technical details about the use of insect cells, baculovirus, and the expression of recombinant HA are all present and unambiguous."

      "explanation": "The quote, including the figure caption, explicitly describes the process of generating recombinant HA (rHA) using the baculovirus insect cell expression system for the manufacture of RIV4 (Flublok). It mentions the use of full length cDNA, polyhedrin promoter, transfer plasmid, and baculovirus (BV) DNA, as well as the process of recombination and expression in insect cells. This directly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)."

The quote is specific about the production method and the use of insect cells and BEVS, which are the key elements of the claim."

      "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the production of recombinant HA using a baculovirus expression vector system: full-length HA cDNA is cloned into a transfer plasmid under a polyhedrin promoter, recombined into linearized baculovirus DNA to produce a BV expression vector carrying the HA gene, which is used to infect cells in a bioreactor; followed by harvest (disc-stack centrifugation), extraction, clarification (depth filtration), purification (capture, polishing, DNA removal), and TFF/formulation. Evidence: The diagram shows insertion of the HA gene into a baculovirus (BV) expression vector under a polyhedrin promoter and subsequent infection and expansion of cells in a bioreactor, indicating use of BEVS to express recombinant HA. The figure supports the claim by directly illustrating a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is generated via a baculovirus expression vector system in cell culture and then purified, thereby supporting the claim. Note: The figure does not explicitly label the cultured cells as insect cells, but the use of a baculovirus vector and polyhedrin promoter strongly implies insect cell expression."
