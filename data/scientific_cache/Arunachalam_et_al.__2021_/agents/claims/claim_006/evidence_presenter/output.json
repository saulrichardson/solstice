      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) is produced using a novel production platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). It also provides additional technical details about the process, such as the use of expresSF+ insect cells and the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, which further substantiates the claim. No inference is required; the support is explicit and direct."

Cleaved fusion peptides (green) and complex glycans eliminate and mask unique epitopes on HA respectively. b Recombinant HA protein (shown as monomer) expressed in insect cells.",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly describes recombinant HA (rHA) being produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), which is the core of the claim about Flublok's production platform. It directly supports the claim by stating the use of BEVS and insect cells for expressing recombinant HA, matching the technical details required."

M. & Hashimoto, Y (2011). A fast track influenza virus va Elsevier Inc, with permission from Elsevier 23.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly references the generation of recombinant HA (rHA) using a baculovirus insect cell expression system, as illustrated in Figure 1 and cited from Cox & Hashimoto (2011). This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The quote is specific to the method of production and does not require inference, thus it genuinely supports the claim."

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly mentions that the manufacture of RIV4 (Flublok) involves a purification system for a product produced in insect cells using baculovirus (BV), which is consistent with the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). No inference is required; the quote provides direct factual support."

      "explanation": "A schematic workflow showing PCR cloning of full-length HA cDNA into a transfer plasmid under a polyhedrin promoter, recombination with linearized baculovirus (BV) DNA to generate a BV expression vector containing the HA gene, followed by insect cell seeding, infection with the virus bank, expansion in a bioreactor, harvest (disc-stack centrifugation), extraction, clarification (depth filtration), and downstream purification (capture, polish, DNA removal, TFF/formulation).

The figure supports the claim by explicitly depicting recombinant HA expression in insect cells via a baculovirus expression vector system under a polyhedrin promoter and subsequent bioreactor production steps, which supports the claim."
