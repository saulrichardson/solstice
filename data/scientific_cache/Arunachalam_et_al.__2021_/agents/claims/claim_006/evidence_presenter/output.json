      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document on page 2, with only minor formatting and OCR-related differences. The factual content is preserved: it states that the recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae) was the first licensed influenza vaccine produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens from live influenza virus, and that its production is based on a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The description of expresSF+ insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, is also present.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The technical details about the use of expresSF+ insect cells, recombinant baculovirus, and the polyhedrin promoter further substantiate the claim. No inference is required; the quote matches the claim exactly."

The quote, including the figure caption and associated text, directly describes the process of generating recombinant HA (rHA) using the baculovirus insect cell expression system for the manufacture of RIV4 (Flublok). It specifically mentions the use of full length cDNA, polyhedrin promoter, transfer plasmid, and recombination in insect cells, which matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim."

The factual content and technical details are preserved, with only minor formatting and spacing differences.. The quote explicitly describes recombinant HA (rHA) being produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), which is the core of the claim.

Among these, the recombinant influenza vaccine tetra valent (RIV4), using a baculovirus expression vector system to express recombinant haem agglutinin (rHA) in insect cells, is the only one to have reached the market and has been studied extensively.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document, though with some minor differences in wording and formatting due to OCR artifacts. The relevant passage is: 'The influenza vaccine field has been constantly evolving to imp improve the breadth and longevity of the protective immune re vaccines in development. Among these, the recombinant influen system to express recombinant haem agglutinin (rHA) in insect studied extensively.' While the sentence is broken up and some words are missing or garbled, the key facts are present: RIV4 (recombinant influenza vaccine, which is Flublok) uses a baculovirus expression vector system to express recombinant HA in insect cells, and it is the only one to have reached the market and has been studied extensively.. The quote, as found in the document, directly states that the recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4/Flublok) uses a baculovirus expression vector system to express recombinant HA in insect cells. This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim."

The factual content and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim by stating that RIV4 (Flublok) contains recombinant HA derived from insect cells, and that its manufacturing process is distinct from other systems. This aligns with the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The document also elsewhere explicitly states that RIV4 is produced using BEVS in insect cells, confirming the claim."

The quote directly describes the generation of recombinant HA (rHA) for RIV4 (Flublok) using a baculovirus (BV) insect cell expression system, which matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The figure caption and associated text explicitly state the use of the baculovirus expression vector and insect cells for rHA production, thus supporting the claim without requiring inference."
