      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculo virus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that circulates in the community is eliminated.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production, and that this eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch. Since the WHO and FDA select the reference strains for seasonal influenza vaccines, this means Flublok's HA antigenic match is identical to those selected strains, as claimed.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears in the document, specifically in the section discussing the avoidance of antigenic mismatch in recombinant vaccines. The text states: 'Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus.

      "explanation": "The quote directly states that recombinant protein technology (as used in Flublok) eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch caused by changes in the HA structure during egg or cell adaptation, which are issues in traditional vaccine manufacturing. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it avoids the adaptive mutations that can cause mismatches.

      "quote": "The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and purified from the clarified cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane filtration. Purified rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential flow filtration and passed through sterile filtration for storage and formulation 22.",
