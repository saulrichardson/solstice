      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that is circulating is eliminated.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the primary amino acid sequence of the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. It further states that this process eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch with the circulating wild type flu virus, which is what the WHO and FDA select for each season. Therefore, the quote genuinely and explicitly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

It explicitly states that recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch caused by changes in the HA structure during egg or cell adaptation, which is a problem in conventional vaccine production.

RIV4 is an una djuv anted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using aba culo virus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculo virus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of aba culo virus poly he drin pro motor.",

Notably, the benefits of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epi to pes is critical for imparting cross protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.",
