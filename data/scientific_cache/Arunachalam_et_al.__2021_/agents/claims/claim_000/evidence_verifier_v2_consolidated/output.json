      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that is circulating in the population is eliminated.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the primary amino acid sequence of the HA antigen is identical to that of the wild type virus isolate selected for vaccine production. It further states that this eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch with the circulating wild type flu virus. Since the WHO and FDA select the reference strains for seasonal influenza vaccines, this directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor formatting and wording differences due to OCR correction. The factual content is preserved.

      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that recombinant protein technology (as used in Flublok) eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch caused by changes in the HA structure during egg or cell adaptation. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it explicitly addresses the prevention of mismatches that can occur in traditional manufacturing methods.",
