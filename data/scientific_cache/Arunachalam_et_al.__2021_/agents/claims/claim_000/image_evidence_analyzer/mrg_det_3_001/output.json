  "explanation": "Two schematic representations of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins showing domain organization (globular head, fibrous stem), cleavage status (HA0 vs HA1/HA2), disulfide bonds, fusion peptide location, and the types of attached glycans (complex polysialylated vs paucimannose) on each form. The figure illustrates structural and glycosylation differences of HA produced in different systems but contains no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; no strain names, antigenic assays, or regulatory matching details are shown.",
