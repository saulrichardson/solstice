  "explanation": "A two-panel schematic of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein structure. Panel a shows the cleaved HA1 (globular head) and HA2 (fibrous stem) subunits with complex, polysialylated N-linked glycans attached and the liberated fusion peptide, highlighting inter-subunit disulfide bonds. Panel b shows the uncleaved HA0 precursor with paucimannose glycans and the uncleaved fusion peptide region, also indicating disulfide bonding and membrane anchoring. The figure only depicts HA structural domains and glycosylation differences between cleaved and uncleaved HA forms; it does not present any data or statements about Flublok's antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim.",
