  "explanation": "Schematic diagrams of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein structures. Panel (a) depicts the cleaved HA1 (blue) and HA2 (red) subunits with attached complex, polysialylated N-glycans at multiple glycosylation sites, showing a cleaved fusion peptide and inter-subunit disulfide bond. Panel (b) shows uncleaved HA0 (blue and red) with paucimannose glycans at similar positions and an uncleaved fusion peptide. The figure illustrates glycosylation patterns and structural domains of HA but contains no data or statements about antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, therefore it does not support the claim.
