  "explanation": "A process flow diagram showing the generation of a baculovirus (BV) expression vector by PCR-direct cloning of full-length HA cDNA under a polyhedrin promoter, recombination into BV DNA, infection of insect cells in a bioreactor, followed by harvest (disc-stack centrifugation), extraction, depth filtration, chromatographic capture and purification with DNA removal, and final tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure solely outlines the molecular cloning and manufacturing workflow for recombinant HA protein and provides no data or statements about antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and thus does not support the claim.",
