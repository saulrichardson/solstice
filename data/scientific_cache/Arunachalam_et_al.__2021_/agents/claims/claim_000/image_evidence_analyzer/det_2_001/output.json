  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flow diagram illustrating the Flublok manufacturing process, including PCR-direct cloning of full-length cDNA into a baculovirus (BV) expression vector, cell seeding, infection and expansion in a bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration for clarification, chromatographic capture and purification steps, DNA removal, and tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure depicts the production and purification workflow for Flublok but contains no data or statements about antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, and thus does not support the claim.",
