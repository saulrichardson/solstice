  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel schematic outlining the Flublok manufacturing process: cloning of full-length HA cDNA into a baculovirus (BV) expression vector, insect cell infection and bioreactor expansion, harvest (disc-stack centrifugation), extraction, clarification (depth filtration), chromatographic purification (capture, polish, DNA removal), and tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure only depicts the recombinant baculovirus\u2013insect cell production workflow for HA protein and does not provide any data or statements about antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; no strain identity or matching data are shown in the image.",
