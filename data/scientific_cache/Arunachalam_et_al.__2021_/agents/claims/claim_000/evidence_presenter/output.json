      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that is circulating is eliminated.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the primary amino acid sequence of the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. It further states that this process eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch with the circulating wild type flu virus, which is what the WHO and FDA select for each season. Therefore, the quote genuinely and explicitly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains."

      "quote": "The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. It explicitly states that recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch caused by changes in the HA structure during egg or cell adaptation, which is a problem in conventional vaccine production. This means the antigen in Flublok remains identical to the selected reference strain, as required by the claim."
