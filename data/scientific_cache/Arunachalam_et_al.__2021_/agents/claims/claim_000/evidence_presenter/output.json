      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that is circulating in the population is eliminated.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording (e.g., 'baculovirus' vs 'baculo virus', 'rHA' vs 'rHA', 'RIV4' vs 'RIV4'). The factual content and technical details are preserved. The passage states: 'Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculo virus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that is circulating in the population is eliminated.' This matches the quote to verify in all substantive respects.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the recombinant process used for RIV4 (Flublok) ensures the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production, and that the risk of antigenic mismatch is eliminated. This means the antigenic match with the WHO- and FDA-selected strains is preserved, as those are the strains selected for vaccine production. The quote does not require inference and is directly relevant to the claim."

      "explanation": "A semantically equivalent quote appears in the document: 'The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.' This matches the provided quote in all factual content, though the original includes a comma and some minor wording differences (e.g., 'the risk of antigenic mismatch' vs. 'risk of antigenic mismatch'). The meaning and technical content are preserved.. The quote directly states that recombinant protein technology (as used in Flublok) eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch caused by changes in the HA structure during egg or cell adaptation. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it asserts that the process avoids the mismatches that can occur in traditional vaccine production. The statement is explicit and does not require inference."
