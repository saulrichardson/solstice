      "quote": "Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type flu virus that is circulating in the population is eliminated.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that the recombinant process used for Flublok (RIV4) ensures the HA antigen is identical to the wild type virus selected for the vaccine, eliminating the risk of antigenic mismatch with the WHO- and FDA-selected strains."

      "quote": "The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and purified from the clarified cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane filtration. Purified rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential flow filtration and passed through sterile filtration for storage and formulation 22.",
