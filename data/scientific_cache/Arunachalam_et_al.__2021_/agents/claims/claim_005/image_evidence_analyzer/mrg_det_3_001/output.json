  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two schematic diagrams (panels a and b) of influenza hemagglutinin glycoprotein structures showing the globular head and fibrous stem domains, glycan compositions (polysialylated complex glycans in the cleaved HA1/HA2 form and paucimannose glycans in the uncleaved HA0 form), fusion peptide cleavage status, inter-disulfide bonds, and membrane topology. The figure depicts structural features and glycosylation patterns of influenza hemagglutinin, with no mention of any clinical trial, vaccine names, or comparisons between Flublok (quadrivalent) and Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose). Therefore, it does not support the claim.",
