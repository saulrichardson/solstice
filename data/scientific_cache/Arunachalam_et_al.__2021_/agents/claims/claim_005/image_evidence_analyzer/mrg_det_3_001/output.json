  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Schematic molecular diagrams showing the structure of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) proteins, depicting the globular head and fibrous stem domains, HA1 and HA2 (or HA0) subunits, glycosylation sites (polysialylated complex glycans and paucimannose glycans), cleavage/uncleaved fusion peptides, and inter-disulfide bonds across the viral membrane. The figure illustrates the molecular structure and glycosylation of influenza HA proteins and does not provide any information about clinical trials or comparisons between Flublok (quadrivalent) and Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for molecular structure content, but it contains no clinical trial data or vaccine evaluation details.",
