  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic diagram showing the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein in two forms: panel a illustrates a cleaved HA (HA1 and HA2 subunits) with polysialylated complex glycans and a cleaved fusion peptide, while panel b shows an uncleaved HA0 form with pauci-mannose glycans and an uncleaved fusion peptide. The panels depict structural and glycosylation differences but no clinical trial design or comparative vaccine evaluation. The figure presents molecular structures of hemagglutinin and its glycosylation patterns, not data or description of a pivotal trial comparing Flublok quadrivalent with Fluarix quadrivalent. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and legible, but contains no trial or comparative vaccine information.",
