  "explanation": "A schematic flow diagram of the baculovirus expression vector production and downstream purification process, including PCR-direct cloning of full-length cDNA into transfer plasmid, recombination to generate BV expression vector with HA gene, cell seeding and infection in a bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration clarification, capture, purification, DNA removal, and tangential flow filtration/formulation. does not support the claim because the figure describes the manufacturing and purification process for HA protein production and contains no information about a pivotal clinical trial or any comparison between Flublok (quadrivalent) and Fluarix (quadrivalent).",
