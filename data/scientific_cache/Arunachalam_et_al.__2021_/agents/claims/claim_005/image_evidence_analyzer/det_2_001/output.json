  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Schematic diagram of baculovirus (BV) expression vector construction and downstream manufacturing process, including PCR-based cloning of full-length cDNA into a polyhedrin promoter vector, recombination to generate HA gene\u2013containing BV expression vector, cell seeding and infection in bioreactors, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, clarification by depth filtration, capture and purification steps, DNA removal, and TFF/formulation. The figure depicts the molecular cloning and manufacturing workflow for a BV-based influenza antigen production process. It contains no information about any clinical trial design, subjects, comparator vaccines, or evaluation against Fluarix quadrivalent. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visual content; no trial-related text or data are visible in this image.",
