  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the manufacturing process of the recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) using a baculovirus-insect cell expression system. Steps include cloning of full-length HA into a transfer vector, recombination with baculovirus DNA, cell seeding and expansion in a bioreactor, harvest, extraction, clarification via depth filtration, capture and purification including DNA removal, tangential flow filtration/formulation. A caption credits the figure to Kimoto Y (2011) and mentions a quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent, GlaxoSmithKline) in a partially visible sentence below. The figure illustrates the manufacturing process of RIV4 and does not present data or explicit details of a pivotal trial comparing Flublok (RIV4) to Fluarix Quadrivalent, therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Image is primarily a process flowchart; the lower text is partially cut off and unclear, so any clinical comparison details are not fully visible.",
