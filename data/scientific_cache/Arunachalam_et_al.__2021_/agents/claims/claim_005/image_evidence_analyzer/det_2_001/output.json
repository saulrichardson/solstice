  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flowchart depicting the recombinant baculovirus-based production process: PCR cloning of full-length HA cDNA into a transfer plasmid with polyhedrin promoter and processing signals, generation of linearized baculovirus (BV) DNA via recombination to create a BV expression vector, cell seeding and infection in a bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration for clarification, chromatographic capture and purification steps including DNA removal, and final tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure shows the manufacturing process for a recombinant HA vaccine using baculovirus expression but provides no data on clinical trials, comparator vaccines, or any evaluation of Flublok versus Fluarix, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear; no trial or comparator information is present.",
