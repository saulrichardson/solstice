RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.' The factual content, including the product names, the recombinant nature, and the 45 \u00b5g HA per strain, is preserved and matches the quote to verify.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines. This substantiates the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim (antigen content) but does not, by itself, support the immunogenicity comparison. Since the task is to verify if the quote supports the claim, and the claim is twofold, the quote supports the antigen content aspect explicitly and factually.",
