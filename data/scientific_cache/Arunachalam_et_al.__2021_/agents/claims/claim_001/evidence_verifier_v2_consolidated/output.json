      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain. While the quote does not explicitly compare this to the standard-dose flu vaccine (which typically contains 15 \u00b5g HA per strain), the information provided is sufficient to substantiate the first part of the claim regarding the HA content being three times higher. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim about greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim (antigen content), but not the immunogenicity comparison. Since the task is to verify if the quote supports the claim, and the claim is partially supported by the explicit content, the answer is true for support of the HA content portion.",

It states that RIV4 (Flublok) elicited significantly higher T-cell and antibody responses than standard egg- or cell-derived split vaccines, and discusses possible reasons for this increased immunogenicity. However, the quote does not mention the HA antigen content (i.e., '3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content') or link the higher immunogenicity specifically to the higher HA content.
