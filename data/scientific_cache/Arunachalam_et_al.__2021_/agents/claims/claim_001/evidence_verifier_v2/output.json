RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose for each strain. This is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, thus supporting the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Still, since the claim is twofold and the quote fully supports the first, it is considered supportive for that portion. There is no contradiction or requirement for inference.",
