The factual content, including the product names, the recombinant nature, and the 45 \u00b5g HA per strain, is preserved and matches the quote to verify.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines. This substantiates the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim (antigen content) but does not, by itself, support the immunogenicity comparison. Since the task is to verify if the quote supports the claim, and the claim is twofold, the quote supports the antigen content aspect explicitly and factually.",

RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",
