RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",

      "explanation": "The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose per strain. While the quote does not explicitly compare this to the standard 15 \u00b5g per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines, it provides the specific HA content for Flublok, which is the key fact in the first part of the claim. The document elsewhere (page 3) mentions that standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (such as Fluarix Quadrivalent) are given at 15 \u00b5g per strain, allowing a direct comparison. However, the quote itself does not address immunogenicity or make a direct link to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim (3x HA content), but does not, by itself, support the second part (link to greater immunogenicity).",
