  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-step schematic workflow illustrating the cloning of full-length HA cDNA into a baculovirus (BV) expression vector under a polyhedrin promoter, followed by insect cell infection in a bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration (clarification), capture and purification steps (including DNA removal), and final tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure only depicts the manufacturing process for producing HA antigen via a baculovirus\u2013insect cell system and subsequent purification steps. It contains no quantitative information on HA antigen content per dose or comparisons to standard-dose flu vaccines; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: None",
