  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flow chart showing the recombinant HA production process in insect cells using a baculovirus vector: cloning of full-length HA cDNA into a transfer plasmid, recombination into BV DNA, infection of insect cells in a bioreactor, harvest by centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration, chromatography steps (capture, purification, DNA removal), and final tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure solely illustrates the manufacturing and purification workflow for HA antigen and does not provide any quantitative information on antigen dose or comparisons to standard-dose flu vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim.",
