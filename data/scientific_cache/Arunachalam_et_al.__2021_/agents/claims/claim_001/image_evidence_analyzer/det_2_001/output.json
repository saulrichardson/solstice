  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Schematic flow diagram depicting the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system used to manufacture RIV4 (Flublok), including steps: cloning of HA gene into baculovirus vector, cell seeding and infection in bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration, capture, purification with DNA removal, and final TFF/formulation. The figure illustrates the production process of RIV4 (Flublok) but does not present any data on HA antigen content or comparisons to standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim.",
