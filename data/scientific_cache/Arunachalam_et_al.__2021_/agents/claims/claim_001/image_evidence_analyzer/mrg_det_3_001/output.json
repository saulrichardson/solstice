  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Schematic figure showing two panels (a and b) of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein structures, including globular head and fibrous stem regions, glycosylation sites, HA1/HA2 subunits, cleavage and disulfide bonds. Glycan compositions and locations are illustrated. The figure depicts structural and glycosylation differences of HA proteins but provides no information on antigen dosing, Flublok content, or comparative HA quantities, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear enough to show structural details but contains no quantitative antigen content or immunogenicity data.",
