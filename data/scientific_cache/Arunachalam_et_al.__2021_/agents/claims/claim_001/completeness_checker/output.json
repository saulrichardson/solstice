      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per dose for each strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim."

RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines.",

      "quote": "A plant derived recombinant quadrivalent VLP (QVLP) at 30 \u00b5g dose per strain was found to be non inferior in terms of vaccine efficacy against respiratory illness and influenza like illness to a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quadrivalent, GlaxoSmithKline) given at 15 \u00b5g dose strain in adults aged 18 to 64 years 37.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides a direct comparison of antigen content per strain (30 \u00b5g vs 15 \u00b5g) and links higher antigen content to non-inferior efficacy, supporting the idea that increased HA content (as in Flublok) is associated with greater or at least equivalent immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines.",
