      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, which is three times the standard 15 \u00b5g HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that RIV4 (Flublok) elicits a greater immunogenic response compared to standard-dose flu vaccines, supporting the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes a study showing that RIV4 (Flublok) produced significantly higher immune responses than standard-dose vaccines, directly supporting the claim that higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity."
