      "quote": "clearly demonstrate structural differences between HA pre fusion and post fusion states, and the presence of unique neutralising epitopes in the pre fusion HA0 molecules, which are present in RIV4 (Fig. 2). Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64. Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant technology (RIV4) induces significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies (which target highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem) and more robust T-cell and antibody responses than conventional vaccines. The mention of 'broadly cross reactive antibodies' and 'robust responses' provides direct evidence for a broader immune response, and the context of 'highly conserved regions' and 'cross reactive' implies potential for cross-protection, even in seasons where there is a mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated."

      "quote": "antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials . RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, SanofiPasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of aglycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It describes a clinical study in which RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) induced a broader antibody response, including to antigenically drifted (mismatched) A/H3N2 viruses. It specifically states that RIV4 was associated with seroconversion to the drifted strain, and that the geometric mean fold rise against circulating viruses was higher for RIV4 than for other vaccines. This provides explicit evidence that recombinant technology can lead to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection, even in a mismatch season."

      "quote": "conserved regions of the molecule for the induction of immunity with broader protection 12 71 76 80. In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutralising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (a recombinant vaccine) induces immunity to conserved regions of the HA molecule, elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines, and references evidence of cross-protection against antigenic drift variants (i.e., mismatched seasons). The quote also cites studies showing RIV4 induces both stem- and head-specific antibodies at higher levels than traditional vaccines, and explicitly links these findings to the potential for broader protection and cross-protection. Thus, the quote genuinely and explicitly supports the claim."

      "quote": "The evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional approaches. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process impurities such as inactivating agents or residual egg protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza and or COVID-19.",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that recombinant protein technology (BEVS/RIV4) eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to changes in HA structure from egg or cell adaptation. It further describes features of the recombinant HA (rHA) tertiary structure that are likely responsible for generating broad cross-reactive and protective antibodies, and references direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The quote also mentions that this platform could be extended to other diseases where cross-protection against evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza. This directly supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season."

      "quote": "The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross protection against mismatched influenza strains 12 75. The study by Nachbagauer et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent influenza viruses similar to the multiple A/H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82. Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against influenza.",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that the structural features of recombinant HA (rHA) produced in insect cells\u2014specifically the higher quantity and greater accessibility of the conserved stem region\u2014may contribute to cross-protection against mismatched influenza strains. It further references studies supporting that recombinant vaccines result in increased titres of broadly neutralising HA stem-reactive antibodies, and that these responses increase with age, possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent viruses. The concluding sentence directly states that vaccine constructs preserving the conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and may confer a greater breadth of protection. This directly and explicitly supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season."

      "quote": "This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the benefits of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly discusses how the unique features of recombinant technology (BEVS derived rHA) maximize vaccine performance and specifically highlights the preservation of conserved epitopes as critical for cross-protection against evolving viruses. This supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, by explicitly linking the technology's features to cross-protection and broader immunity."

      "quote": "The glycosylation of HA has various functions, including regulation of the virus life cycle and a role in disease pathogenesis71. During vaccine manufacture, the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in determining HA N-glycan composition 72 73. Glycoproteins expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated, paucimannosidic or oligomannosidic glycans)74. An et al.72 showed that egg derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cell derived HA predominantly contained highly branched complex or high mannose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9 insect cells had relatively small paucimannose glycans (Fig. 2)72. The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions could provide broader specificity. Antisera raised against simple monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine induced protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76-79.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant technology (specifically, the use of insect cells to produce HA with simpler glycans) leads to the exposure of conserved regions, which in turn allows for the induction of antibodies with broader specificity. It further cites studies showing that such antibodies provide improved breadth and cross-clade protection compared to those raised against fully glycosylated HA. This directly substantiates the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season."
