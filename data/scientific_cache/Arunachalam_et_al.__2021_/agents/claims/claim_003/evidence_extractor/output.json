      "quote": "Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem in both mice and humans compared to split vaccines. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that recombinant HA antigens induce higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies, which are associated with broader immune responses and cross-protection, supporting the claim."

      "quote": "RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3 N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3 N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3 N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3 N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of aglycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports 26.",

      "quote": "The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross protection against mismatched influenza strains 12 75. The study by Nachbagauer et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent influenza viruses similar to the multiple A/H3 N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82. Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against influenza.",

      "quote": "This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the benefits of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.",

      "quote": "The influenza vaccine field has been constantly evolving to improve the breadth and longevity of the protective immune response across age groups, giving rise to an array of next generation vaccines in development. Among these, the recombinant influenza vaccine tetravalent (RIV4), using a baculovirus expression vector system to express recombinant haemagglutinin (rHA) in insect cells, has been studied extensively. We describe how the unique structural features of recombinant proteins, unique post translational processing of the rHA in RIV4 improve protective immune responses compared to conventional influenza vaccines made from propagated influenza virus.",
