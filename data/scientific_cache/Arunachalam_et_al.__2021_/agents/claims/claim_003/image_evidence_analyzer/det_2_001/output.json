  "explanation": "Schematic flowchart of the recombinant baculovirus influenza vaccine manufacturing process, showing steps from full-length cDNA cloning into a transfer plasmid with polyhedrin promoter, recombination to generate a baculovirus expression vector containing the HA gene, followed by cell seeding, infection in a bioreactor, harvest (disc-stack centrifugation), extraction, depth filtration/clarification, purification (capture, polish, DNA removal), and tangential flow filtration/formulation This figure outlines only the manufacturing workflow for a recombinant vaccine and provides no immunogenicity or cross-protection data; it does not support the claim",
