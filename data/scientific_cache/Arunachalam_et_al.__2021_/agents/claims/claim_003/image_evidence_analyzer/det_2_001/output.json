  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Diagram of the baculovirus-insect cell expression system workflow for manufacturing a recombinant HA-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), showing steps: cell seeding, bioreactor expansion, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration (clarification), capture, purification (including DNA removal), and tangential flow filtration/formulation. Accompanied by a caption referencing adaptation from a 2011 journal article. The figure illustrates the manufacturing process for a recombinant influenza vaccine but provides no immunogenicity or cross-protection data, and thus does not support the claim that recombinant technology leads to broader immune responses or cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: No immune response or clinical efficacy data are shown; caption text is partially cut off and no mismatch season evidence is presented.",
