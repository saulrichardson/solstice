  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "Schematic diagram of recombinant influenza vaccine production using baculovirus expression in insect cells, including PCR cloning of full-length cDNA into a transfer plasmid under a polyhedrin promoter, recombination to generate a baculovirus (BV) expression vector containing the HA gene, cell seeding and infection in a bioreactor, downstream processing steps such as disc-stack centrifugation (harvest), extraction, depth filtration (clarification), chromatographic capture and purification (including DNA removal), and tangential flow filtration (TFF)/formulation. The figure strictly outlines the recombinant vaccine manufacturing workflow and presents no data on immune responses, breadth of protection, or cross-protection in mismatch seasons, and therefore does not support the claim.",
