  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flow chart illustrating the recombinant baculovirus expression system for producing full-length hemagglutinin (HA) protein in insect cells, including PCR\u2010direct cloning, transfer plasmid assembly, baculovirus recombination, cell seeding and infection, bioreactor expansion, harvest (disc-stack centrifugation), depth filtration clarification, extraction, capture, purification (including DNA removal), and final tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure depicts the technical manufacturing process of a recombinant HA vaccine using baculovirus in insect cells; it does not present any immunogenicity data or demonstrate broader immune responses or cross-protection in a mismatch season, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No clinical or immunological data are shown; the image quality and content focus solely on production steps.",
