  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two schematic diagrams (panels a and b) of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) proteins showing the globular head and fibrous stem domains, annotated glycan structures (polysialylated complex glycans in a; paucimannose glycans in b), fusion peptide status (cleaved in a; uncleaved in b), inter-disulfide bonds, membrane orientation, and subunit labeling (HA1/HA2 vs HA0). The figure only illustrates structural and glycosylation differences between HA produced by recombinant versus conventional methods and does not present any data on immune responses, cross-protection, or efficacy in mismatch seasons, so it does not support the claim. Note: No direct immune or clinical data are shown; the figure focuses solely on molecular structure and glycosylation.",
