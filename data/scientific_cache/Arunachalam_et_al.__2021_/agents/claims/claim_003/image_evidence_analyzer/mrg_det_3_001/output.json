  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-panel schematic comparing the structural features of native influenza HA (panel a) and recombinant HA produced in insect cells (panel b). Panel a shows the viral HA heterodimer (HA1 and HA2) with complex, sialylated N-linked glycans and cleaved fusion peptide. Panel b shows the recombinant HA0 precursor monomer with uncleaved fusion-peptide loop and simpler, paucimannosidic N-linked glycans exposing unique epitopes. The figure only illustrates structural and glycosylation differences between native and recombinant HA proteins; it provides no experimental or immunogenicity data demonstrating a broader immune response or cross-protection. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to structural schematics; no immunological data are presented.",
