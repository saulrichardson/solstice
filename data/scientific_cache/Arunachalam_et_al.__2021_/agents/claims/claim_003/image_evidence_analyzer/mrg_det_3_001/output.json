  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Schematic diagrams of influenza hemagglutinin proteins comparing a cleaved HA1/HA2 with complex polysialylated glycans (panel a) versus an uncleaved HA0 with paucimannose glycans (panel b). The diagrams label the globular head, fibrous stem, glycan types, fusion peptide status, and disulfide bonds. The figure only shows structural differences in glycosylation and cleavage of HA proteins and provides no data on immune response breadth or cross-protection in mismatch seasons, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear for structural interpretation but contains no immunogenicity or cross-protection evidence.",
