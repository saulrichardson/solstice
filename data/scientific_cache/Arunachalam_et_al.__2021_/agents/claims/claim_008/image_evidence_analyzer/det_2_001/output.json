  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flow diagram illustrating the generation of a baculovirus expression vector carrying the HA gene via PCR-direct cloning and recombination, followed by cell seeding, infection, expansion in a bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, clarification by depth filtration, and downstream purification steps including capture, purification, DNA removal, and tangential flow filtration/formulation. does not support the claim: the figure only depicts the manufacturing process of recombinant HA vaccine production and contains no information on HA microgram amounts per strain for Flublok or standard-dose influenza vaccines. Note: The image does not present any quantitative HA content data; it is purely a process flow diagram.",
