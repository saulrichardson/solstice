  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A process flow diagram illustrating the baculovirus expression system for producing recombinant hemagglutinin protein: PCR cloning of full-length cDNA into a transfer plasmid under the polyhedrin promoter, recombination to create a baculovirus expression vector carrying the HA gene, infection of insect cells and expansion in a bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, clarification via depth filtration, downstream purification steps (capture, purification, DNA removal), and final tangential flow filtration/formulation. does not support the claim because the figure solely outlines the manufacturing and purification process and provides no quantitative information on HA dosage per strain, so it doesn't support the claim.",
