  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flowchart illustrating the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system for manufacturing the RIV4 (Flublok) influenza vaccine, including cloning of the HA gene into a baculovirus vector, cell seeding and expansion in bioreactors, harvest, extraction, clarification by depth filtration, capture, purification with DNA removal, and final formulation. The figure does not support the claim, as it only depicts the production process for RIV4 and contains no information on HA microgram dosages per strain, therefore it does not support the claim. Note: No numeric dosage information is present in the image; visibility and content are sufficient to confirm absence of HA quantity data.",
