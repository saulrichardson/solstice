  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two schematic diagrams (panels a and b) of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein showing the globular head and fibrous stem regions, glycan structures (polysialylated complex glycans vs paucimannose glycans), cleavage status of the fusion peptide, and disulfide bonds. No quantitative dosage information is presented. This figure focuses on HA structural and glycosylation differences and does not provide any information on microgram quantities per strain, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: None",
