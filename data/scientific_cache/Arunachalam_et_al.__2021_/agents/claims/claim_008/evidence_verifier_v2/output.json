      "quote": "The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 micrograms (\u00b5g) of HA per dose from each of the four strains, which matches the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain. While the quote does not mention the 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose influenza vaccine, it does provide explicit support for the Flublok portion of the claim. The information about standard-dose vaccines is found elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quadrivalent, GlaxoSmithKline) given at 15 \u00b5g dose strain in adults aged 18 to 64 years'), so the quote, in context, supports the claim as stated.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae, Supemtek\u00ae [EU, Canada], Sanofi pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 \u00b5g of HA/dose from each of the four strains.' The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., '\u00b5g' vs 'mcg', 'dose' vs 'per strain'), but the meaning and numbers are preserved.",

The rHA contained in RIV4 differs from that expressed in other systems in terms of specific structural features, the nature of the source material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on certain aspects of vaccine safety and efficacy (Fig. 2). Based on these unique features RIV4 received 'product exclusivity' protection.",
