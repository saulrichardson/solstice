  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flowchart depicting the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) workflow for producing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) antigen, including steps such as PCR cloning of full-length cDNA into a transfer plasmid under a polyhedrin promoter, recombination to generate a BV expression vector, cell seeding and infection in a bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, clarification by depth filtration, capture and purification steps, DNA removal, and formulation by tangential flow filtration (TFF). does not support the claim because the figure only outlines the manufacturing process of BEVS-derived HA and provides no data on antibody responses, cross-reactivity, or comparisons with egg-derived vaccines Note: Image is clear but contains only process steps without any immunogenicity or comparative study data",
