  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flow diagram depicting the manufacturing process of recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) antigens using the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system (BEVS). It includes steps for cloning the HA gene into a baculovirus vector, cell seeding, bioreactor expansion, harvest by disc\u2010stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration/clarification, capture, purification, DNA removal, and tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure only illustrates the production and purification workflow for recombinant HA using BEVS and provides no data on antibody responses or cross-reactivity; it does not support the claim.",
