  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two schematic diagrams of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) showing the globular head and fibrous stem with different glycan structures attached. Panel a illustrates HA1/HA2 after cleavage with polysialylated complex N-glycans; panel b illustrates uncleaved HA0 with predominantly paucimannose glycans. Structural features such as fusion peptide, disulfide bonds, and N- and C-termini are labeled. The figure only depicts glycosylation patterns on HA produced in different systems and does not present any data on antibody responses or cross-reactivity. Therefore, it does not support the claim regarding higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies induced by BEVS-derived HA. Note: Analysis limited to visible structural schematics; no immunogenicity or antibody titer data present in the image.",
