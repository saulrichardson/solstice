  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-part schematic comparing native influenza HA (panel a) and recombinant HA (rHA) produced in insect cells via baculovirus expression (panel b). Panel a shows HA1 and HA2 subunits linked by inter-disulfide bonds, cleaved fusion peptide, and complex sialylated N-linked glycans. Panel b shows a single HA0 precursor with uncleaved fusion-peptide loop and simpler paucimannose N-linked glycans, highlighting structural and glycosylation differences. The figure illustrates structural and glycosylation differences between native and BEVS-produced HA but provides no data on antibody responses or comparisons with egg-derived vaccines; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Figure only depicts molecular structure and glycan profiles; no immunogenicity or antibody titer data are shown.",
