Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift.

RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines.
