      "quote": "RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenic ally drifted A/H3 N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belong i a et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion in activated trivalent influenza vaccine (Flu zone High Dose, SanofiPasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3 N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenic ally advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3.",

The factual content, numbers, and technical details are preserved.

The quote directly supports the claim. It provides explicit evidence that RIV4, a recombinant HA antigen produced using BEVS, induces significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against antigenically drifted (and thus more conserved) A/H3N2 viruses compared with egg-derived vaccines. The study cited in the quote measured antibody responses to multiple A/H3N2 viruses, including drifted strains, and found RIV4 elicited a greater fold rise in antibodies than both high-dose and adjuvanted egg-derived vaccines.

RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines.
