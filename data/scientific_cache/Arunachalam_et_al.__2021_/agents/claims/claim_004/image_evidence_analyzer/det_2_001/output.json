  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic diagram outlining the production process of a recombinant baculovirus (BV)\u2013based influenza vaccine: PCR cloning of full-length cDNA into a transfer plasmid with a polyhedrin promoter, recombination to generate a BV expression vector carrying the HA gene, cell seeding and infection in a bioreactor, harvest by disc\u2010stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration (clarification), capture chromatography, purification including DNA removal, and final tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure illustrates the manufacturing workflow for a recombinant flu vaccine but provides no data on immune responses or comparative antibody titers versus an egg-based standard-dose vaccine, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and focused on production steps; no immunogenicity, dosage, or antibody\u2010response data are shown.",
