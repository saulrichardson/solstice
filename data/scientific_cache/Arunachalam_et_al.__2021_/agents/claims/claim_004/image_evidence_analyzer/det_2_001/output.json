  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic diagram of the recombinant baculovirus\u2013insect cell production process, showing PCR cloning of full-length cDNA into a transfer plasmid with a polyhedrin promoter, generation of a baculovirus (BV) expression vector carrying the HA gene by recombination, infection of insect cells in a bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration for clarification, and downstream capture, purification (including DNA removal), and tangential flow filtration/formulation steps. The figure illustrates the manufacturing workflow for a recombinant flu vaccine but provides no data comparing antibody responses or immunogenicity between high-dose recombinant and egg-based standard-dose vaccines; therefore, it does not support the claim.",
