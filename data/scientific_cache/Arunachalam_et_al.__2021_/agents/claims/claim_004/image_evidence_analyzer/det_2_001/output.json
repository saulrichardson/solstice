  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flowchart showing the generation of a baculovirus (BV) expression vector containing the influenza HA gene via PCR-direct cloning and recombination, followed by large-scale bioreactor expansion, harvest (disc-stack centrifugation), extraction, depth filtration, multi-step purification (capture, polishing, DNA removal), and tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure illustrates the upstream and downstream manufacturing process for recombinant influenza HA antigen but contains no data on vaccine dose comparisons or antibody responses; it does not support the claim.",
