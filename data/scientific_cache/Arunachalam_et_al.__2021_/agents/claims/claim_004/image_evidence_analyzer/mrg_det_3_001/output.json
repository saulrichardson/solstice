  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two\u2010panel schematic showing influenza hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein structures: panel a depicts the cleaved HA1/HA2 on the viral surface with complex polysialylated glycans; panel b shows uncleaved HA0 with paucimannose glycans. Both diagrams label the globular head, fibrous stem, fusion peptide status, and disulfide bonds. The figure illustrates HA structural and glycosylation differences between recombinant and egg\u2010derived proteins but contains no data on antibody titers or immune responses. Therefore, it does not support the claim regarding a more robust antibody response. Note: Interpretation limited by absence of accompanying immunogenicity data and reliance solely on structural schematics.",
