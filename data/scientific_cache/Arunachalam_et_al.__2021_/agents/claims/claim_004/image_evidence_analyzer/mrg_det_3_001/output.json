  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two schematic diagrams of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) anchored in a viral membrane, showing domain structure and glycosylation. Panel a depicts the cleaved HA1 (globular head) and HA2 (fibrous stem) subunits with polysialylated complex glycans, a cleaved fusion peptide, and inter-disulfide bond. Panel b shows the uncleaved HA0 precursor with paucimannose glycans, an uncleaved fusion peptide, and a disulfide bond. The figure illustrates HA molecular structure and glycan composition but provides no data on vaccine formulations, dosage, or antibody responses, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity or clinical data are presented; image quality is sufficient to see structural details but irrelevant to antibody response comparison.",
