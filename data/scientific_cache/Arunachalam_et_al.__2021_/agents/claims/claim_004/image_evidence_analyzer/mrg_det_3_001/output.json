  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two schematic diagrams of influenza hemagglutinin glycoproteins. Panel a depicts the cleaved HA1/HA2 structure with polysialylated complex glycans and a cleaved fusion peptide (likely recombinant HA). Panel b depicts the uncleaved HA0 structure with paucimannose glycans and an uncleaved fusion peptide (likely egg-derived HA). Both show membrane anchors and disulfide bonds. The figure illustrates structural and glycosylation differences between recombinant and egg-based HA but presents no data on antibody titers, dose comparisons, or immunogenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to structural schematics without accompanying immunogenicity data. Image quality is sufficient to assess content, but no functional or clinical outcomes are shown.",
