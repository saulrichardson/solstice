  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two schematic illustrations (panels a and b) comparing the structural features of native hemagglutinin (HA) extracted from influenza virus (HA1 and HA2 subunits with complex-type sialylated N-linked glycans and cleaved fusion peptide) versus recombinant HA (single HA0 precursor with paucimannose N-linked glycans and uncleaved fusion peptide) produced in insect cells. The figure only depicts structural differences in glycosylation and fusion-peptide cleavage between native and recombinant HA proteins and contains no data on vaccine dose comparisons or antibody responses; it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to structural illustration; no immunogenicity or dose\u2013response data are presented.",
