      "quote": "Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in wording and formatting. The factual content is preserved: Richards et al. examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine, or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018). The document states: 'RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity.' This matches the quote to be verified.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (the higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the egg-derived split vaccine (a standard-dose, egg-based vaccine) and cell-derived split vaccine. This is a direct comparison of antibody responses, showing that the recombinant vaccine induces a more robust antibody response than the standard egg-based vaccine, as claimed."

      "quote": "Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document: 'Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64.' The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly compares recombinant HA antigens (as used in RIV4, a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) to egg-derived split vaccines, stating that the recombinant vaccine induced 'significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies.' This directly supports the claim that vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines."

      "quote": "Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and punctuation. The relevant sentence is: 'Higher magnitudes of haem agglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60.' The factual content, technical terms, and vaccine names are all preserved and match the quote to be verified.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (a recombinant influenza vaccine, which is higher-dose at 45 \u00b5g HA per strain) induces higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 compared to standard egg-based and mammalian cell-derived split vaccines (which are standard-dose). This is a direct comparison of antibody response magnitude between higher-dose recombinant and standard-dose egg-based vaccines, thus substantiating the claim without requiring inference."

      "quote": "In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording (e.g., 'Belong i a et al.82' instead of 'Belongia et al.82', 'Flu zone High Dose, SanofiPasteur; HD-IIV3' instead of 'Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3'). The factual content, including the study design, age group, vaccines compared (RIV4, HD-IIV3, aIIV3), the viruses tested, and the result that the post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3, is preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It describes a study in which participants received either a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV4) or egg-based standard-dose/adjuvanted vaccines, and the antibody response (measured as geometric mean fold rise) against circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4. This provides explicit evidence that the higher-dose recombinant vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines."
