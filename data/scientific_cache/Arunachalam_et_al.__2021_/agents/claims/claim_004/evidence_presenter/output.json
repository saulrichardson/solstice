      "quote": "Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg derived split vaccine, cell derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long term immunity 65.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It reports that RIV4 (a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) elicited 'significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels' than both egg-derived and cell-derived split vaccines in healthy adults over three influenza seasons. This is a direct comparison of antibody responses, showing that the recombinant vaccine induced a more robust response than standard egg-based vaccines, which is exactly what the claim asserts."
    },
    {
      "quote": "Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg derived split vaccines 64.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly compares recombinant HA antigens (as used in RIV4, a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) to egg-derived split vaccines (standard-dose, egg-based vaccines), stating that the recombinant vaccine induced 'significantly higher levels of broadly cross reactive antibodies.' This directly supports the claim that vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines."

    {
      "quote": "Higher magnitudes of haem agglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur 60.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly compares RIV4 (a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine) to both egg-based and mammalian cell-derived standard-dose split vaccines, stating that RIV4 induces higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody responses against HA1. This is explicit evidence that RIV4 may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines, thus directly supporting the claim."

    {
      "quote": "In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly compares the antibody response (measured as geometric mean fold rise) between RIV4 (a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) and both high-dose and adjuvanted egg-based vaccines in older adults. It states that the antibody response to two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for the egg-based high-dose or adjuvanted vaccines. This provides explicit evidence that vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose (and even high-dose) vaccines, thus supporting the claim."

      "quote": "In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutralising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax [Trivalent] 77.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) induces HA stem-specific neutralising antibodies in humans, with the highest titres in the elderly, and that RIV4 induces antibodies to HA head epitopes at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine. This provides direct evidence that RIV4 may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose, egg-based (or mammalian cell-based) vaccines, as claimed."
