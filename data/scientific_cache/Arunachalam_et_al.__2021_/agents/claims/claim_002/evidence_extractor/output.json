      "quote": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can acquire adaptive mutations during production, and that these mutations in the HA protein may reduce vaccine effectiveness, supporting the claim."

      "quote": "Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides a specific example of a mutation arising during egg-based vaccine production that altered the immune response, supporting the claim that such mutations can occur and affect effectiveness."

      "quote": "During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote gives concrete evidence that mutations acquired during egg-based vaccine production led to reduced vaccine effectiveness in a specific flu season, directly supporting the claim."

      "quote": "Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote further supports the claim by stating that egg-adapted mutations during manufacturing have repeatedly contributed to reduced effectiveness in multiple seasons."

      "quote": "Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for H3 N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to circulating strains 27.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote highlights that even when the vaccine strain matches the circulating virus, mutations acquired during production (such as in eggs or cells) can still reduce effectiveness, supporting the claim."
