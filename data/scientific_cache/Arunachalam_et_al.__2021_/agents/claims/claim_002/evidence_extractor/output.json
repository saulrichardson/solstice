      "quote": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that traditional (cell- and egg-based) influenza vaccines can acquire adaptive mutations during production in eggs or mammalian cells, and that these mutations may reduce vaccine effectiveness, directly supporting the claim."

      "quote": "Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides a concrete example of a mutation arising during egg-based vaccine production, which altered the immune response to favor the vaccine strain over the circulating wild type virus, illustrating how such mutations can impact effectiveness."

      "quote": "During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote details specific mutations that occurred during egg adaptation in vaccine production and directly links these mutations to reduced vaccine effectiveness, supporting the claim."

      "quote": "Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote generalizes the problem, stating that antigenic mutations from egg adaptation during manufacturing have contributed to low effectiveness in multiple seasons, reinforcing the claim."

      "quote": "Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for H3 N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to circulating strains 27.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote notes that lower effectiveness for H3 N2 has persisted even when the vaccine strain matches the circulating virus, implying that mutations during production (such as those from egg adaptation) are a likely cause."
