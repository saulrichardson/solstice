The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a concrete example (from Raymond et al.) of a mutation (glutamine to arginine at position 226) arising during egg-based vaccine production, which led to the immune response being directed more toward the vaccine strain than the circulating wild type virus. This illustrates how such mutations can reduce vaccine effectiveness, as the antibodies produced may not optimally target the circulating virus.
