      "quote": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that traditional split or subunit vaccines (which are cell- and egg-based) have the potential to acquire adaptive mutations during growth in embryonated chicken eggs or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. It further states that such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine. This is a direct and explicit confirmation of the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."

    {
      "quote": "Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example of a mutation (glutamine to arginine at position 226) arising during egg-based vaccine production, and explains that this mutation altered the immune response such that antibodies preferentially bound to the vaccine-derived HA rather than the circulating wild type virus. This demonstrates that mutations can occur during production and may reduce vaccine effectiveness, as the claim asserts."

      "quote": "During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example where mutations (H156Q, G186V, S219Y) developed during egg-based vaccine production, and explicitly states that these mutations were attributed to a reduction in vaccine effectiveness (41%) for H3N2 in the 2012-2013 season. This demonstrates that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness, as the claim asserts."

    {
      "quote": "Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation during vaccine manufacturing have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness in multiple influenza seasons. This demonstrates that mutations can develop during production (specifically in egg-based vaccines) and that these mutations may reduce vaccine effectiveness, which is exactly what the claim asserts."
    },
    {
      "quote": "Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for H3 N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to circulating strains 27. Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim by stating that lower vaccine effectiveness for H3N2 has been observed even when the vaccine strain is well matched to circulating strains, and that differences in HA glycosylation (which can arise during production) are thought to contribute to this reduced effectiveness. This aligns with the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations or changes during production that may reduce their effectiveness."

    {
      "quote": "The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch that can occur due to changes in the primary HA structure during egg- or cell-based adaptation. This directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote confirms that such changes (mutations) are a known risk in egg- or cell-based production, and that recombinant technology avoids this risk."

    {
      "quote": "During the 2014-2015 influenza season, a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26. For the 2016-2017 season, the influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26. However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a concrete example where an egg-adapted vaccine virus lost a glycosylation site during production, and as a result, antibodies induced by the vaccine poorly neutralized the circulating strain that retained the glycosylation site. This demonstrates that mutations (in this case, loss of a glycosylation site) can occur during production in eggs, and these mutations can reduce vaccine effectiveness. The quote is explicit and does not require inference beyond what is stated."
    },
    {
      "quote": "The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly addresses the potential for cell- and egg-based flu vaccines to develop mutations during production, stating that while the chances are low due to stringent quality control, the risk is not zero. It explicitly mentions the possibility of introducing deleterious mutations through adaptation of the seed virus during manufacturing, which may reduce vaccine effectiveness. This directly supports the claim that such vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness."
