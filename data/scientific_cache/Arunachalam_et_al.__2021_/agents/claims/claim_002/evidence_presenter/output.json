      "quote": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor formatting differences. The content is semantically equivalent: 'POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.' This matches the quote to verify in all relevant factual content.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that traditional split or subunit influenza vaccines, which are produced in embryonated chicken eggs or mammalian host cells (i.e., cell- and egg-based vaccines), have the potential to acquire adaptive mutations in the HA (hemagglutinin) protein during manufacture. It further states that such mutations may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine. This is a direct and explicit confirmation of the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."

      "quote": "Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, in the section discussing potential antigenic mismatch of influenza vaccine virus grown in egg or cells due to adaptive mutations. The text states: 'Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glut amine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'glutamine' split as 'glut amine'). All technical content and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a concrete example (from Raymond et al.) of a mutation (glutamine to arginine at position 226) arising during egg-based vaccine production, which led to the immune response being directed more toward the vaccine strain than the circulating wild type virus. This illustrates how such mutations can reduce vaccine effectiveness, as the antibodies produced may not optimally target the circulating virus. The document explicitly connects adaptive mutations during production to reduced effectiveness, thus substantiating the claim."

      "quote": "During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the section titled 'POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE.' The document states: 'During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156 Q, G186 V, and S219 Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.' The factual content, numbers, and technical details are preserved and match the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example where mutations (H156Q, G186V, and S219Y) developed during egg-based vaccine production, and explicitly states that these mutations were attributed to a reduction in vaccine effectiveness (41%) for H3N2 in the 2012-2013 season. This demonstrates that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness, as asserted in the claim."

      "quote": "Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, in the section discussing the potential antigenic mismatch of influenza vaccine virus grown in egg or cells due to adaptive mutations in the HA primary structure. The sentence in the document reads: 'Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.' This matches the provided quote in both content and meaning.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness for H3 N2 in multiple influenza seasons. This demonstrates that mutations can develop during production (specifically in egg-based systems) and that these mutations may reduce vaccine effectiveness, which is exactly what the claim asserts."

      "quote": "During the 2014-2015 influenza season, a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26. For the 2016-2017 season, the influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26. However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, though with minor wording differences. The factual content is preserved: 'During the 2014-2015 influenza season, a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain possessing anew predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26. For the 2016-2017 season, the influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26.

The meaning, technical content, and numbers are all present and match the quote to verify.. The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example where an egg-adapted influenza vaccine virus lost a glycosylation site during production, resulting in antibodies that poorly neutralized the circulating virus. This demonstrates that mutations (in this case, loss of a glycosylation site) can occur during production in eggs, and these mutations can reduce vaccine effectiveness. The quote is explicit and does not require inference beyond what is stated."

      "quote": "The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.",
      "explanation": "The quote 'The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.' appears in the document, near the end of page 6. The wording is an exact match, and the context is about how recombinant protein technology avoids the risk of antigenic mismatch that can arise from changes in HA structure during egg or cell adaptation.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that egg- or cell-based vaccine production carries a risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes (mutations) in the primary HA structure during adaptation, which is the basis for reduced effectiveness. The statement contrasts this risk with recombinant technology, which eliminates it, thereby affirming that the risk exists for egg- and cell-based vaccines."
