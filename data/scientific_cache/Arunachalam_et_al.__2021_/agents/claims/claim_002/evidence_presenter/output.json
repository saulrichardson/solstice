      "quote": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that traditional split or subunit influenza vaccines, which are produced in embryonated chicken eggs or mammalian host cells, have the potential to acquire adaptive mutations during manufacture. It further states that such mutations in the HA (hemagglutinin) peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine. This is a direct affirmation of the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness."

    {
      "quote": "Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example (Raymond et al.) where an egg-adapted influenza vaccine strain acquired a mutation (glutamine to arginine at position 226) during production. This mutation altered the immune response, causing antibodies to preferentially bind the vaccine-derived HA rather than the circulating wild type virus, which could reduce vaccine effectiveness. This is explicit evidence that mutations can arise during egg-based vaccine production and may impact effectiveness, as the claim asserts."

    {
      "quote": "During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a concrete example where mutations (H156Q, G186V, S219Y) acquired during egg-based vaccine production were linked to reduced vaccine effectiveness (41%) in the 2012-2013 flu season. This is explicit evidence that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness, as stated in the claim."
    },
    {
      "quote": "Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness in multiple influenza seasons, specifically for H3N2. This directly substantiates the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."

    {
      "quote": "The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly addresses the claim. It states that there is a chance (albeit low due to quality control) of introducing deleterious mutations during the adaptation of seed virus in egg or cell-based manufacturing, and that such mutations can occur during vaccine production. It further explains that recombinant DNA technology avoids this risk because it does not use live virus. This supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "quote": "The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch that can occur due to changes in the primary HA structure from egg- or cell-adaptation. This directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote confirms that such mutations (adaptive changes) are a known risk in egg- or cell-based production, and that recombinant technology avoids this risk."
