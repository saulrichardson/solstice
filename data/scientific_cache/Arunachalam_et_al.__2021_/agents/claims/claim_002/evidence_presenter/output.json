    {
      "quote": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that traditional split or subunit influenza vaccines (which are cell- and egg-based) have the potential to acquire adaptive mutations during production in eggs or mammalian cells, and that these mutations in the HA protein may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. This is a direct and explicit confirmation of the claim, with no inference required."
    },
    {
      "quote": "Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a concrete example (from Raymond et al.) where an egg-adapted influenza vaccine strain acquired a mutation during production, which altered the immune response such that antibodies preferentially recognized the vaccine strain over the circulating wild type virus. This illustrates how mutations arising during egg-based vaccine production can reduce vaccine effectiveness, thus substantiating the claim."

    {
      "quote": "During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example where mutations (H156Q, G186V, and S219Y) developed during egg-based vaccine production, and explicitly states that these mutations were attributed to reduced vaccine effectiveness (41%) in the 2012-2013 season. This demonstrates that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness, as asserted in the claim."
    },
    {
      "quote": "Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation during vaccine manufacturing have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness in multiple influenza seasons. This demonstrates that mutations can develop during production in egg-based (and by extension, cell-based) vaccines, and that these mutations may reduce vaccine effectiveness, which is exactly what the claim asserts."
    },
    {
      "quote": "The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that there is a known risk of adaptive mutations occurring in cell- and egg-based vaccine production, which can reduce vaccine effectiveness. It further clarifies that while current quality control reduces this risk, it does not eliminate it, and recombinant technology avoids this risk entirely. This directly substantiates the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "quote": "The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that recombinant protein technology (as opposed to egg- or cell-based production) eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch that can arise from 'potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation.' This affirms that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations (adaptive changes) during production, which may reduce their effectiveness, thus supporting the claim."
