  "explanation": "A schematic process flow diagram illustrating recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine production using a baculovirus expression system in insect cells: shows PCR-direct cloning of full-length cDNA into a transfer plasmid with a polyhedrin promoter, recombination to generate baculovirus (BV) expression vector carrying the HA gene, cell seeding and infection in a bioreactor, followed by harvest (disc-stack centrifugation), extraction, depth filtration (clarification), capture, purification, DNA removal, and tangential flow filtration (TFF) formulation. does not support the claim because the figure only depicts a recombinant baculovirus-cell culture production and purification workflow and contains no data or statements about mutations arising in cell- or egg-based flu vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness",
