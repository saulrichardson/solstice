  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic workflow diagram illustrating the production of a recombinant HA influenza vaccine using a baculovirus expression vector system in insect cells. The left side shows PCR cloning of full-length cDNA into a transfer plasmid, recombination to create a baculovirus (BV) expression vector carrying the HA gene, followed by steps of cell seeding, infection with virus bank, expansion in bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration for clarification, chromatographic capture, purification with DNA removal, and tangential flow filtration/formulation. does not support the claim \u2013 the figure only shows the recombinant baculovirus-insect cell process flow and does not present any data or discussion about mutations arising during cell- or egg-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness. Note: The image quality is sufficient to interpret the process flow; no mutation or effectiveness data are displayed.",
