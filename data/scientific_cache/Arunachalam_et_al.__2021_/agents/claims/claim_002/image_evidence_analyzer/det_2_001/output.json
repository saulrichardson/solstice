  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the production process of a baculovirus-based vaccine: full-length cDNA PCR cloning into a transfer plasmid under a polyhedrin promoter, recombination to generate a baculovirus (BV) expression vector carrying the HA gene, cell seeding and infection in a bioreactor, harvest by disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration for clarification, chromatographic capture and purification steps with DNA removal, and final tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure illustrates the technical workflow for producing a baculovirus-based vaccine and contains no information about mutations arising during egg- or cell-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and focused on manufacturing steps; no sections mention mutation development or antigenic changes.",
