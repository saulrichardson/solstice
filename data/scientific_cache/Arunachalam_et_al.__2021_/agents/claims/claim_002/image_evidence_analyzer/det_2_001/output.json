  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic workflow illustrating the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system for manufacturing a recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4). It shows steps from cloning of the HA gene into a baculovirus expression vector, infection of insect cells in a bioreactor, harvest, disc-stack centrifugation, extraction, depth filtration for clarification, capture, purification with DNA removal, and tangential flow filtration/formulation. The figure is a process diagram of a baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system and contains no information about the occurrence of mutations during production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim.",
