  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two schematic cartoons of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) proteins (panels a and b) showing the globular head and fibrous stem domains, glycosylation sites annotated with complex polysialylated glycans (panel a) or paucimannose glycans (panel b), cleavage status of the fusion peptide, and inter-disulfide bonds, all depicted relative to the viral membrane. The figure illustrates HA structure and glycan compositions but contains no data or statements about mutations arising during egg- or cell-based vaccine production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis based solely on visible schematic; no mention of production methods or mutational changes, but image labels are clear and sufficiently legible to assess content.",
