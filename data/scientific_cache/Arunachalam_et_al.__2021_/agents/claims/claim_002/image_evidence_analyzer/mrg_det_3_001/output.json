  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic comparison of influenza hemagglutinin proteins, showing a cleaved HA1/HA2 heterodimer with polysialylated complex glycans (panel a) and an uncleaved HA0 monomer with paucimannose glycans (panel b), including labels for globular head, fibrous stem, fusion peptide, disulfide bonds, and membrane topology. The figure illustrates glycosylation and cleavage differences in hemagglutinin proteins produced under different conditions but makes no mention of mutations arising during vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim.",
