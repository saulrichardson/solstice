      "quote": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can acquire adaptive mutations during production, specifically in the HA protein, and that these mutations may reduce vaccine effectiveness, supporting the claim."

      "quote": "Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides a concrete example of a mutation arising during egg-based vaccine production, which altered the immune response to favor the vaccine strain over the circulating virus, illustrating how such mutations can reduce effectiveness."

      "quote": "During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.",

      "quote": "Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for H3 N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to circulating strains 27. Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote notes that even when vaccine strains are well matched, changes (including mutations and glycosylation differences) arising during production can reduce effectiveness, supporting the claim about production-induced mutations."

      "quote": "During the 2014-2015 influenza season, a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26. For the 2016-2017 season, the influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26. However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides a specific example of how egg adaptation during vaccine production led to the loss of a glycosylation site in the HA protein, resulting in reduced neutralization of the circulating virus and thus supporting the claim that mutations during production can reduce vaccine effectiveness.",
