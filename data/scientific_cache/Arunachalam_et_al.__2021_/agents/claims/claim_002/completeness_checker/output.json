      "quote": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26.",

      "quote": "Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24.",

      "quote": "During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25.",

      "quote": "During vaccine manufacture, the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in determining HA N-glycan composition 72 73. Glycoproteins expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated, paucimannosidic or oligomannosidic glycans)74. An et al.72 showed that egg derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cell derived HA predominantly contained highly branched complex or high mannose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9 insect cells had relatively small paucimannose glycans (Fig. 2)72.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that the host cell type (egg or mammalian) used in vaccine production can alter the glycosylation pattern of the HA protein, which is a form of mutation or modification that can affect the antigenic properties and thus the effectiveness of the vaccine.",

      "quote": "The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use 'live' influenza virus.",
