POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26. Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glut amine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24. During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156 Q, G186 V, and S219 Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25. Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27. Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for H3 N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to circulating strains 27. Differences in HA glycosylation between the

This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the benefits of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epi to pes is critical for imparting cross protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.

avian flu pandemics, when egg supply may be impacted. The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more efficient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quad rival ent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok®, Sup emtek® [EU, Canada], San of i pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for in activated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an una djuv anted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using aba culo virus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculo virus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of aba culo virus poly he drin pro motor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and purified from the clarified cell extract using column chromatograph ies followed by Q membrane filtration. Purified rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential flow filtration and passed through sterile filt ti f t d f lti 22 RIV4 h d

responses in healthy adults with favourable to ler ability. The E. coli expression system has been shown to generate ahigh yields of rHA (200 mg/L of purified HA protein) using a minimal number of bio reactors 31. The authors projected that the strategy could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a medium scale pharmaceutical production facility 31. This approach will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process 32. However, E. coli expressed rHA proteins can be subject to mis folding, contain impurities (e.g., host cell proteins), and do not undergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive processing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native conformation 31. The resulting processed proteins are less immunogenic than egg derived antigens, with around a 10 fold greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in animal models 31. These inherent complications have prevented large scale manufacturing and eventual commercial is ation of E. coli expressed influenza vaccines. Vaccines containing plant derived rHA either in soluble form or in virus like particles (VLPs) have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans 34 37. A plant derived recombinant quad rival ent VLP (QVLP) at 30 µg dose per strain was found to be non inferior in terms of vaccine efficacy against respiratory

RECOMBINANT HA EXPRESSION SYSTEMS Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been used for the manufacture of rHA vaccine antigens. The first candidate recombinant influenza vaccines to be successfully manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA protein genetically fused with the Toll like receptor 5 ago nist, Salmonella typhimurium flag ellin type 229. The resultant vaccines elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse models 29. In Phase 1 clinical evaluation, aprototypic quad rival ent vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune responses in healthy adults with favourable to ler ability 30.

2016-2017 season, the influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26. However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26. Contrary to the egg derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that efficiently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 virus 26. The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use ‘live’ influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculo virus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type fl f

vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26. During the 2014-2015 influenza season, a clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain possessing anew predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26. For the 2016-2017 season, the influenza vaccine was updated to include

illness and influenza like illness to a quad rival ent in activated influenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quad rival ent, Glaxo smith kline) given at 15 µg dose strain in adults aged 18 to 64 years 37. However, inconsistency in the expression levels of target proteins, due to non specific integration of trans gene (s) into the host genome, has been a major challenge with plant based expression systems 34. The unpredictable yield could adversely impact timely vaccine production, which typically involves updating at least one HA component of the vaccine to reflect antigenic change in the circulating influenza viruses each season. A unique positive attribute of plant derived rHA is that it can stimulate innate immunity that predominantly facilitates Type 1 pro inflammatory cellular immune responses, potentially as a direct effect of the plant origin lipids/glycolipids in the vaccine formulation 38. These sti mula tory components in a plant derived vaccine may need to be controlled and kept at a constant level, for commercial is ation, to avoid potential severe adverse events caused by enhanced immune responses in vaccine es.

Elimination of these unwanted proteins from the vaccine required extensive disassembly and reassembly processing of purified VLPs, which is acon strainst for the commercial scale manufacturing of vaccines annually. It also raises the cost and the time it takes to bring the vaccines to the market. The yield and the cost of various manufacturing processes and technologies are critical elements to ensure adequate supply of vaccine at an affordable cost, especially in a pandemic situation. This aspect of the vaccine manufacturing has been discussed exhaustively in a report published by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) and is not covered here 47.

exclusion high performance liquid chromatography is monitored for the release and the stability of RIV4. Further character is ation by cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the HA rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniformly starfish shaped; whereas in the split vaccine they are mostly non symmetrical and agglomerated into huge structures, resulting in both starfish- and peanut shaped heterogeneous particles 55. Additional electron microscopy analysis of split vaccine clusters showed a highly heterogeneous mixture containing different types of viral particles containing HA and NA as well as split viral membrane folded in various shapes, slightly disrupted virions, and whole virions66. In Canada between 2000 and 2004, an unusual number of cases of a syndrome termed as oculo-respiratory syndrome (ORS) were reported following immunisation with the in activated influenza split virus vaccine 68. Detailed analysis revealed that ORS, induced within 2 to 24 hof vaccination, was suspected to be due to the presence of micro aggregates of un split virions in the conventional egg derived influenza vaccines 69. High levels of aggregate content in the split vaccine are believed to have

When these are extracted from influenza viruses, they form clusters of varying sizes.

RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines.

antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials . RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross reactive antibody responses to antigenic ally drifted A/H3 N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belong i a et al.82, participants aged 65-74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high dose split virion in activated trivalent influenza vaccine (Flu zone High Dose, SanofiPasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3 N2 viruses including a cell propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenic ally advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post vaccination titre against the antigenic ally drifted H3 N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0 003.

In a study by Nach bag auer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem specific neutral ising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haem agglutinin in an age dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epi topes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell derived subunit vaccine (Flu cel vax [Trivalent 77. Higher magnitudes of haem agglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell derived split vaccines (Flu cel vax Tetra, Seq i rus, and Flu zone quad rival ent SD, San of i Pasteur 60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12 81.

y p g y ( g ) The peptide sequences around gly cosy lati on sites are highly conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions could provide broader specificity. Anti ser a raised against simple mono gly cosy lated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against lethal challenge with H5 N1 compared to anti ser a raised against fully gly cosy lated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of gly cans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine induced protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler gly cans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76-79. The presence of simpler gly cans appears to be equally efficient to that of chicken or mammalian cell derived gly cosy lati on in ensuring the proper folding of HA, and exposes conserved regions of the molecule for the induction of immunity

THE N-LINKED GLYCAN STRUCTURE OF RECOMBINANT HA PRODUCED IN INSECT CELLS DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM HA IN OTHER INFLUENZA VACCINES Influenza HA has a variable number of N-linked glycosylation sites (depending on the virus strain and subtype) in the globular head region and the conserved stem region 71. The glycosylation of HA has various functions, including regulation of the virus life cycle and arole in disease pathogenesis71. During vaccine manufacture, the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in determining HA N-glycan composition 72 73. Glycoproteins expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated, paucimannosidic or oli go mannos i dic glycans)74. An et al.72 showed that egg derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cell derived HA predominantly contained highly branched complex or high man nose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9 insect cells had relatively small pau cim an nose glycans (Fig. 2)72.

Moreover, another study of commercial influenza vaccine preparations detected other viral proteins such as nucleoprotein and matrix protein (confirmed by a chromatographic separation) that are not shown to be relevant for vaccine effectiveness, and viral RNA fragments (confirmed by activity as say 90 91. Such egg derived or other influenza virus derived proteins (as described above) and influenza viral RNA fragments are not present in recombinant vaccines. Although uncommon, some individuals may be at increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions to component proteins such as oval bum in and those who are sensitised may be at higher risk of clinical manifestations of allergic disease upon exposure 92. Egg protein, viral RNA, and process impurities such as in activating agents or hydro cortisone that are typically present in conventional vaccines are absent in RIV4 would eliminate potential adverse reactions, although rare, to these components in vulnerable individuals 93.

This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent influenza viruses similar to the multiple A/ H3 N2 virus strains evaluated by Belong i a et al.82.

This unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved. The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross protection against mismatched influenza strains 12 75.

, p genrichment. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral in activation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process impurities such as in activating agents or residual egg protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza and or COVID-19.
