      "text": "POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26. Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1 N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glut amine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild type virus 24. During the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3 N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild type influenza viruses in three positions, H156 Q, G186 V, and S219 Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3 N2 in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25. Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3 N2 in other influenza seasons 26 27. Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for H3 N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to circulating strains 27.

The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more efficient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quad rival ent influenza vaccine (RIV4, FlublokÂ®, Sup emtekÂ® [EU, Canada], San of i pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for in activated split virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an una djuv anted vaccine containing 45 Âµg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using aba culo virus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculo virus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of aba culo virus poly he drin pro motor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and purified from the clarified cell extract using column chromatograph ies followed by Q membrane filtration.

However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 strain 26. Contrary to the egg derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that efficiently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2 a H3 N2 virus 26. The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use â€˜liveâ€™ influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level 28. As such, the primary amino acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculo virus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wild type fl f",

The E. coli expression system has been shown to generate ahigh yields of rHA (200 mg/L of purified HA protein) using a minimal number of bio reactors 31. The authors projected that the strategy could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a medium scale pharmaceutical production facility 31. This approach will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process 32. However, E. coli expressed rHA proteins can be subject to mis folding, contain impurities (e.g., host cell proteins), and do not undergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive processing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native conformation 31. The resulting processed proteins are less immunogenic than egg derived antigens, with around a 10 fold greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in animal models 31. These inherent complications have prevented large scale manufacturing and eventual commercial is ation of E. coli expressed influenza vaccines.

Elimination of these unwanted proteins from the vaccine required extensive disassembly and reassembly processing of purified VLPs, which is acon strainst for the commercial scale manufacturing of vaccines annually. It also raises the cost and the time it takes to bring the vaccines to the market. The yield and the cost of various manufacturing processes and technologies are critical elements to ensure adequate supply of vaccine at an affordable cost, especially in a pandemic situation. This aspect of the vaccine manufacturing has been discussed exhaustively in a report published by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) and is not covered here 47. Insect cell derived rHA (RIV4) has been studied extensively by various groups in both pre clinical models and humans. The rHA contained in RIV4 differs from that expressed in other systems in",

However, inconsistency in the expression levels of target proteins, due to non specific integration of trans gene (s) into the host genome, has been a major challenge with plant based expression systems 34. The unpredictable yield could adversely impact timely vaccine production, which typically involves updating at least one HA component of the vaccine to reflect antigenic change in the circulating influenza viruses each season. A unique positive attribute of plant derived rHA is that it can stimulate innate immunity that predominantly facilitates Type 1 pro inflammatory cellular immune responses, potentially as a direct effect of the plant origin lipids/glycolipids in the vaccine formulation 38. These sti mula tory components in a plant derived vaccine may need to be controlled and kept at a constant level, for commercial is ation, to avoid potential severe adverse events caused by enhanced immune responses in vaccine es.

      "text": "THE N-LINKED GLYCAN STRUCTURE OF RECOMBINANT HA PRODUCED IN INSECT CELLS DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM HA IN OTHER INFLUENZA VACCINES Influenza HA has a variable number of N-linked glycosylation sites (depending on the virus strain and subtype) in the globular head region and the conserved stem region 71. The glycosylation of HA has various functions, including regulation of the virus life cycle and arole in disease pathogenesis71. During vaccine manufacture, the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in determining HA N-glycan composition 72 73. Glycoproteins expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated, paucimannosidic or oli go mannos i dic glycans)74. An et al.72 showed that egg derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cell derived HA predominantly contained highly branched complex or high man nose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9 insect cells had relatively small pau cim an nose glycans (Fig. 2)72.

We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral in activation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process impurities such as in activating agents or residual egg protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza and or COVID-19.
