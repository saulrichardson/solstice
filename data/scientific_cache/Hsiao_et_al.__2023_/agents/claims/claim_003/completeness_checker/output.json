      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that recombinant vaccines are not affected by antigenic drift during manufacturing, which is a key mechanism by which vaccine mismatch occurs. This supports the claim that recombinant technology may provide broader immune responses and cross-protection in mismatch seasons."

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote details that the recombinant vaccine uses a hemagglutinin protein identical to the selected strain and at a higher dose, which is associated with increased protective antibodies. This supports the idea that recombinant technology can elicit a broader and potentially more effective immune response."

      "quote": "However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall in a year with a mismatch and from the higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",
