      "quote": "The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall in a mismatch season.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly addresses the claim. It states that the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing (implying a broader immune response), and that during a season when the circulating strain was poorly matched to both vaccine types, the recombinant vaccine still showed a benefit over the standard dose vaccine. The authors specifically note that the observed benefit is more likely due to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall in a mismatch season, which supports the idea of broader immune response and potential cross-protection even when there is a mismatch.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 10 of the document, with only minor differences in wording and formatting. The factual content and meaning are preserved. The relevant passage is: 'The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.

      "explanation": "A forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% CIs) of a recombinant influenza vaccine versus comparator across multiple high-risk subgroups (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, and any of these) for three outcomes: PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. Each subgroup has a point estimate to the right of the zero line, indicating positive relative effectiveness. Evidence: All subgroup estimates in a mismatch season have positive relative vaccine effectiveness with confidence intervals that do not cross zero, indicating consistent protection across conditions. The figure supports the claim by demonstrating positive relative effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine across multiple subgroups during a mismatch season, implying cross-protection even when circulating strains are mismatched. Note: Cannot directly observe mechanistic data on immune breadth; evidence is clinical effectiveness in subgroups rather than immunologic assays.",
