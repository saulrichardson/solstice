      "quote": "Quadri valent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that recombinant vaccines are not affected by antigenic drift during manufacturing, which is a key mechanism by which vaccine mismatch occurs. This supports the claim that recombinant technology may provide broader immune responses and cross-protection in mismatch seasons."

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes how recombinant technology produces a vaccine antigen that is genetically identical to the selected strain and at higher antigen dose, both of which are associated with a broader and potentially more protective immune response, supporting the claim."

      "quote": "The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly contrasts the susceptibility of standard vaccines to antigenic drift (which can cause mismatch) with the stability of recombinant vaccines, supporting the idea that recombinant technology can provide broader protection even in mismatch seasons."

      "quote": "However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall in a season with a mismatch and from the higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that the recombinant vaccine showed higher effectiveness even in a season with a mismatched circulating strain, supporting the claim that recombinant technology leads to broader immune responses and cross-protection."
