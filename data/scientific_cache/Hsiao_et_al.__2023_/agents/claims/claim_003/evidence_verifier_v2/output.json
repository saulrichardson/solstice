      "quote": "The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall in a mismatch season.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly addresses the claim. It states that the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing (implying a broader immune response), and that during a season when the circulating strain was poorly matched to both vaccine types, the recombinant vaccine still showed a benefit over the standard dose vaccine. The authors specifically note that the observed benefit is more likely due to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall in a mismatch season, which supports the idea of broader immune response and potential cross-protection even when there is a mismatch.",
