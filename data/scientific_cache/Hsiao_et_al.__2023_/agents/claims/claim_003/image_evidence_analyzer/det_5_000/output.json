  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the selection of study cohorts from 2,776,278 vaccinated participants aged 18\u201364 years over three influenza seasons (2018\u20132021). The population is split into those who received recombinant vaccine (1,018,043) and standard-dose vaccine (1,758,235), with successive exclusions for non-KPNC members, inpatient vaccinations, vaccinations outside the eligible date range, missing facility identifiers, and inability to assign facility-specific propensity scores. Final cohorts include 632,962 recombinant vaccine recipients and 997,366 standard-dose recipients (with age subgroup counts). The figure only outlines cohort selection and does not present any immunologic data or outcomes regarding breadth of immune response or cross-protection, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clear but limited to design and participant counts; no immune response or cross-protection results are shown.",
