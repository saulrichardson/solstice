  "explanation": "A flow diagram illustrating the selection and exclusion process for study participants aged 18\u201364 years who received either a recombinant influenza vaccine (n=1,018,043) or a standard-dose vaccine (n=1,758,235) over three seasons, detailing successive exclusion criteria (non-membership, inpatient vaccinations, dates out of range, missing facility identifiers, unassigned propensity scores) and the final cohort sizes for the 2020\u20132021 season (recombinant: 632,962; standard-dose: 997,366) with age subgroup counts. The figure only shows participant flow and cohort sizes and does not support the claim because it contains no data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or mismatch season outcomes. Note: The analysis is limited to what is visible; no immunogenicity or efficacy data are presented in this flowchart.",
