  "explanation": "The figure shows a schematic of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) service area facilities, grouping of similarly sized facilities into Block A or Block B, and a table illustrating the weekly alternating administration schedule of two influenza vaccine formulations (standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent [SD-IIV4] and recombinant quadrivalent [RIV4]) for each facility over four weeks. The image depicts the randomization design and vaccine administration schedule but does not present any immunologic or clinical data on immune response breadth or cross-protection; therefore, it does not support the claim.",
