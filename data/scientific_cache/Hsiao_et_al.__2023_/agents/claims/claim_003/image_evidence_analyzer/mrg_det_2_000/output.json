  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic figure showing Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) facilities grouped by service area and size, randomly assigned to two blocks (A and B), followed by a table of alternating weekly vaccinations over four weeks (SD-IIV4 versus RIV4) for each facility. The figure presents the randomization of facilities and the weekly alternation of standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) but provides no data on immune responses, breadth of immunity, or cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and legible but contains only study design and scheduling information, with no immunogenicity or efficacy results.",
