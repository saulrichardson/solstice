  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing outcomes between a recombinant influenza vaccine (N=279,400) and a standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852), showing number of cases per 1000, unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI), relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI), and p-values for primary (PCR-confirmed influenza) and secondary outcomes (PCR-confirmed influenza A and B, hospitalizations for influenza, pneumonia, cardiorespiratory events). The table reports relative vaccine effectiveness and hazard ratios but does not present any data on broader immune response or cross-protection in mismatch seasons, so it does not support the claim. Note: No mention of mismatch season or cross-protection context is provided; analysis limited to the visible effectiveness data.",
