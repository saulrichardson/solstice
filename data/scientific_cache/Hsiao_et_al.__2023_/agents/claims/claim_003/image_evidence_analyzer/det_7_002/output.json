  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A table comparing clinical outcomes between recipients of a recombinant influenza vaccine (N=279,400) and an egg-based influenza vaccine (N=395,852), showing number of cases per 1000 for PCR-confirmed influenza (primary outcome) and several secondary outcomes, along with unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios, vaccine effectiveness estimates (with 95% CIs), and P values. does not support the claim because the table presents comparative effectiveness in one season without any data on breadth of immune response or cross-protection in a mismatch season and does not address recombinant technology\u2019s immunogenic breadth. Note: No information on mismatch seasons or immunogenicity; limited to clinical effectiveness outcomes in a single setting.",
