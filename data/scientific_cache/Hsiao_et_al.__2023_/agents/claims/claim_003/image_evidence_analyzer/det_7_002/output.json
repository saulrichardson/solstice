  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular comparison of clinical outcomes in adults receiving a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (n=279,400) versus a standard-dose vaccine (n=395,852), showing number of cases per 1,000 for PCR-confirmed influenza (overall, A, and B), hospitalizations for influenza, pneumonia, and cardiorespiratory events, along with unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI), relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI), and P values. The table reports relative effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine against PCR-confirmed influenza and related hospitalizations but does not provide any data on breadth of immune response, cross-protection, or performance in antigenically mismatched seasons; it does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear and legible but lacks any immunogenicity or mismatch-season subgroup analyses; conclusions about cross-protection cannot be drawn from these outcome data alone.",
