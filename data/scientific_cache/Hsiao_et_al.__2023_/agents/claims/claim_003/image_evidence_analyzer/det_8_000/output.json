  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Forest plot showing subgroup analysis of relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI) of a recombinant influenza vaccine compared with a standard-dose vaccine among participants aged 50\u201364 years, stratified by preexisting conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above) for three outcomes: PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. The figure presents relative effectiveness estimates by comorbidity subgroup but does not address immune response breadth or cross-protection in mismatch seasons, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The plot focuses on subgroup VE comparisons and does not include data on antigenic mismatch, cross-reactivity, or immunogenicity measures.",
