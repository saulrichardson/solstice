  "claim_id": "claim_003",
  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% CIs) of a recombinant influenza vaccine versus comparator across multiple high-risk subgroups (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, and any of these) for three outcomes: PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. Each subgroup has a point estimate to the right of the zero line, indicating positive relative effectiveness. Evidence: All subgroup estimates in a mismatch season have positive relative vaccine effectiveness with confidence intervals that do not cross zero, indicating consistent protection across conditions. The figure supports the claim by demonstrating positive relative effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine across multiple subgroups during a mismatch season, implying cross-protection even when circulating strains are mismatched. Note: Cannot directly observe mechanistic data on immune breadth; evidence is clinical effectiveness in subgroups rather than immunologic assays.",
