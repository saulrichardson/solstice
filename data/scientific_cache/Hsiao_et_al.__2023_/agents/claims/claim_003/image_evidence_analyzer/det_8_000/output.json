  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) of a recombinant influenza vaccine compared to a standard comparator across clinical subgroups (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, and any of the above) for three outcomes: PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. The x-axis is percentage relative effectiveness with a null line at 0%. The figure presents subgroup-specific comparative effectiveness of a recombinant vaccine versus another vaccine but does not address immune breadth, cross-protection, or performance during a mismatch season; therefore, it does not support the claim Note: No data on mismatch seasons or immunologic breadth are shown; some confidence intervals are wide and may cross the null",
