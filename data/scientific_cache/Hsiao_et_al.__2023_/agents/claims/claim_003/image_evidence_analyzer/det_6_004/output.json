  "explanation": "A table listing demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, race/ethnic group, Hispanic ethnicity, coexisting illnesses, prior-year flu vaccination) of participants receiving recombinant vaccine, standard-dose vaccine, and all vaccinees. does not support the claim because the table only provides baseline participant characteristics and contains no data on immune responses, breadth of response, or cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: The table is demography-focused and does not include immunogenicity or cross-protection outcomes; thus it cannot address the claim.",
