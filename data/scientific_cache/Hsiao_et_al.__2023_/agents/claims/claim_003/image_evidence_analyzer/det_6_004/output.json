  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of demographic and clinical characteristics of participants vaccinated with recombinant vaccine (N=279,400), standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852), and all vaccinees (N=675,252), listing sex, race/ethnic group, Hispanic ethnicity, coexisting illnesses (asthma, diabetes, COPD, coronary heart disease), and receipt of influenza vaccine in the previous year. The table presents only baseline demographic and clinical characteristics; it contains no data on immune responses, breadth of immunity, cross-protection, or effectiveness in mismatch seasons, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to baseline characteristics table; no immunogenicity or efficacy data are shown in the image.",
