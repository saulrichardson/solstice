      "quote": "In the current study, we compared the effectiveness of the high dose recombinant vaccine with that of standard dose vaccines in patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years.",
      "explanation": "The quote, 'In the current study, we compared the effectiveness of the high dose recombinant vaccine with that of standard dose vaccines in patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years,' appears on page 10 of the document. The wording is nearly identical, with only minor differences in phrasing (e.g., 'high dose recombinant vaccine' instead of 'Flublok Quadrivalent'), but the meaning and factual content are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the study compared the effectiveness of a high dose recombinant vaccine (which, per the document, is Flublok Quadrivalent) with standard dose vaccines. The document also clarifies elsewhere that Flublok Quadrivalent was the recombinant vaccine used, and Fluarix (a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine) was among the standard dose comparators. Therefore, the quote genuinely affirms that Flublok Quadrivalent was evaluated in the pivotal trial against a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine."

      "quote": "A strength of our study is that the two study vaccine formulations were alternated in weekly intervals of time at each facility, which allowed us to balance covariates of interest as designed. In every KPNC geographic area, when influenza arrived, there were already participants who had received one of the two formulations of vaccine and who were similar with respect to demographic characteristics, coexisting illnesses, and mortality at KPNC and nationwide in a similar age group.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 10 of the document, with only minor paraphrasing and no substantive differences in meaning or technical content. The document states: 'A strength of our study is that the two study vaccine formulations were alternated in weekly intervals of time at each facility, which allowed us to balance covariates of interest as designed. In every KPNC geographic area, when influenza arrived, there were already participants who had received one of the two formulations of vaccine and who were similar with respect to demographic characteristics, coexisting illnesses, and mortality at KPNC and nationwide in a similar age group.' This matches the quote provided, with all key facts and context preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the study alternated two vaccine formulations (the recombinant/high-dose vaccine, i.e., Flublok quadrivalent, and standard dose vaccines) weekly at each facility. This confirms that Flublok quadrivalent was evaluated against a standard dose vaccine in the pivotal trial, as the claim asserts. The quote also describes the study design in a way that substantiates the head-to-head comparison between these two vaccine types."

      "quote": "In this study performed during two influenza seasons, participants between the ages of 50 and 64 years who received the recombinant vaccine had more protection against confirmed influenza than those who received a standard dose vaccine.",
      "explanation": "A semantically equivalent quote appears on page 10: 'In this study performed during two influenza seasons, participants between the ages of 50 and 64 years who received the recombinant vaccine had more protection against confirmed influenza than those who received a standard dose vaccine.' This matches the provided quote in all key factual content, though the sentence is split by a page break in the OCR text. The meaning and data are preserved.. The quote directly states that the study compared a recombinant vaccine (Flublok quadrivalent) to a standard dose vaccine in participants aged 50-64, and that the recombinant vaccine provided more protection. The methods and results sections of the document confirm that the recombinant vaccine used was Flublok quadrivalent and that the comparator was a standard dose quadrivalent vaccine (Fluarix or similar). Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine)."
