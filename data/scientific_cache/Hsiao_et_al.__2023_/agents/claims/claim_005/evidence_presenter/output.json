      "quote": "Study Design This was a cluster randomized observational study that was designed to include all KPNC members between the ages of 18 and 64 years who had received a licensed recombinant or standard dose vaccine as part of routine clinical care during the three influenza seasons from 2018 to 2021. The 2019-2020 season was truncated in March 2020 because of the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine was donated by Sanofi, and the two standard dose vaccines used during the study seasons were purchased by KPNC.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (the recombinant vaccine) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against standard dose vaccines (which, from context, are quadrivalent standard-dose vaccines). The study design involved comparing these two types of vaccines in the specified population, confirming that the pivotal trial compared Flublok Quadrivalent with standard-dose quadrivalent vaccines."
    },
    {
      "quote": "In the current study, we compared the effectiveness of the high dose recombinant vaccine with that of standard dose vaccines in patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against a quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine. The document explicitly states that the study compared the high dose recombinant vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) with standard dose vaccines in the relevant age group. While the specific brand 'Fluarix' is not named, the claim is supported in the sense that the pivotal trial compared Flublok Quadrivalent to standard dose quadrivalent vaccines, as described in the quote."
    },
    {
      "quote": "In this study performed during two influenza seasons, participants between the ages of 50 and 64 years who received the recombinant vaccine had more protection against confirmed influenza than those who received a standard dose vaccine.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that, in the study, participants aged 50-64 who received the recombinant vaccine (Flublok quadrivalent) had more protection against confirmed influenza than those who received a standard dose vaccine. The methods section of the document further clarifies that the recombinant vaccine used was Flublok Quadrivalent and that it was compared to standard dose quadrivalent vaccines (such as Fluarix). Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine)."
    },
    {
      "quote": "In each region, the facilities were assigned to either Block A or Block B to optimize the balance between blocks with respect to facility size (Fig. 1). We randomly assigned Block A to start with administration of a standard dose vaccine and Block B to start with administration of the recombinant vaccine. Thereafter, each facility alternated the administration of the two vaccines weekly.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly describes the study design, stating that facilities alternated between administering a standard dose vaccine and a recombinant vaccine (Flublok quadrivalent is the recombinant vaccine referenced throughout the document). This supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against a quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine (Fluarix is one of the standard-dose vaccines used, as stated elsewhere in the document). The quote provides explicit evidence of a head-to-head evaluation between the two vaccine types."
