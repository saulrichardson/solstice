      "quote": "In this study performed during two influenza seasons, participants between the ages of 50 and 64 years who received the recombinant vaccine had more protection against confirmed influenza than those who received a standard dose vaccine.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that the study compared a recombinant vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) to a standard dose vaccine in participants aged 50 to 64, and found greater protection in the recombinant group. The methods and results sections of the document confirm that the recombinant vaccine used was Flublok Quadrivalent and that the comparator was a standard dose quadrivalent vaccine (Fluarix or similar). Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine)."
