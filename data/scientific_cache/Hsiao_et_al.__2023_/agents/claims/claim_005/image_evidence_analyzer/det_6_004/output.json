  "explanation": "A table of participant demographic and clinical characteristics divided into two groups labeled \u2018recombinant vaccine (N=279,400)\u2019 and \u2018standard vaccine (N=395,852)\u2019, showing age, sex, race/ethnicity, preexisting illness, and prior-year vaccination percentages. The table does not explicitly name Flublok or Fluarix or indicate that the standard-dose vaccine is Fluarix, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table columns are labeled generically and the product names are not visible; image cut-off limits confirmation of vaccine names.",
