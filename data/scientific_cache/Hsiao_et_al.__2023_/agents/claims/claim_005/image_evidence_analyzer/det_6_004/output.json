  "explanation": "Table displaying demographic and clinical characteristics of participants in a study comparing a recombinant vaccine (N=279,400) with a standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852), including sex, race or ethnic group, Hispanic ethnicity, coexisting illnesses, and prior influenza vaccination status. The table compares a generic 'recombinant vaccine' versus a 'standard-dose vaccine' but does not identify the products as Flublok or Fluarix, therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Brand names and quadrivalent status are not specified in the image, limiting the ability to confirm the exact vaccines evaluated.",
