  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing clinical outcomes (e.g., PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalizations) comparing two groups: 'Recombinant Vaccine (N=279,400)' versus 'Standard-Dose Vaccine (N=395,852)', with columns for unadjusted rate ratio, adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI), relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI), and P values. Evidence: The table compares a generic 'Recombinant Vaccine' against a generic 'Standard-Dose Vaccine' but does not name Flublok or Fluarix anywhere in the headers or footnotes. The table does not support the claim because it does not explicitly identify Flublok (quadrivalent) or Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) as the products under comparison, so it does not support the claim. Note: Brand names are absent; interpretation is limited to what is visible.",
