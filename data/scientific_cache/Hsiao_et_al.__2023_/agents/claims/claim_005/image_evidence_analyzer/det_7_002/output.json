  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table displaying clinical outcomes comparing a recombinant vaccine (N=279,400) to a standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852), listing number of cases per 1,000 for PCR-confirmed influenza (primary outcome) and several secondary outcomes, along with unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI), relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI), and P values. does not support the claim because the table only refers to a generic recombinant vaccine versus a generic standard-dose vaccine without naming Flublok or Fluarix or indicating quadrivalent formulations, so it does not confirm that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent). Note: Table content is clear but lacks specific vaccine brand names and quadrivalent designation, preventing confirmation of the claim.",
