  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of primary and secondary clinical outcomes (e.g., PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalizations) comparing two vaccine groups (N=279,400 and N=395,852) with columns for unadjusted rate ratio, adjusted rate ratio, hazard ratio, effectiveness, and P values. The table shows outcome comparisons between two vaccine cohorts but does not identify either vaccine as Flublok or Fluarix and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Vaccine names are not visible in the cropped image; inability to confirm which vaccines were compared.",
