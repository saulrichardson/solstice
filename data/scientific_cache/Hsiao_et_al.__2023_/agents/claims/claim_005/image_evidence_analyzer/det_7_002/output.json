  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing outcomes (primary and secondary) for two groups: a Recombinant Vaccine (N=279,400) and a Standard-Dose Vaccine (N=395,852), showing number of cases per 1000, unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI), relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI), and P values for PCR-confirmed influenza A and B, hospitalizations for confirmed influenza, community-acquired pneumonia, and cardiorespiratory events. The table compares a recombinant vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine but does not name the products or state that the standard-dose vaccine is Fluarix; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: None; the table is legible but lacks specific vaccine brand names.",
