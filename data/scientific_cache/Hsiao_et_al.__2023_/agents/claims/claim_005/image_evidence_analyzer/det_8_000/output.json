  "explanation": "A multi\u2010panel forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% CIs) across subgroups (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above) for outcomes: PCR\u2010confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR\u2010confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community\u2010acquired pneumonia. The x\u2010axis is percentage effectiveness from \u201350% to +55%, with points and horizontal lines representing subgroup estimates. The figure does not name the vaccines being compared (no mention of Flublok or Fluarix) and thus doesn't support the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard\u2010dose vaccine). Note: Analysis limited to visible labels; if vaccine names appear elsewhere in the document they are not shown in this figure.",
