  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% CIs) for various subgroups (PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia) stratified by underlying conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above). The x-axis displays percentage relative effectiveness from \u201350% to +55%. The figure presents relative effectiveness of a quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine versus a quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine across clinical subgroups, but it does not name the comparator as Fluarix. Therefore this evidence does not support the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated specifically against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine). Note: The figure is clear but lacks brand names, so the specific comparator vaccine cannot be confirmed.",
