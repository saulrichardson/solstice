  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",

  "explanation": "Forest plot showing subgroup analysis of relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% CI) against PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia among participants aged 50\u201364, according to preexisting conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any condition). The plot compares a recombinant vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine, with percentage effectiveness on the x-axis. The figure does not support the claim because it only refers generically to a recombinant vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine and does not name Flublok or Fluarix, so it doesn\u2019t support the claim that Flublok quadrivalent was evaluated against Fluarix quadrivalent. Note: Limited by the figure labeling: vaccines are described generically without brand names, and no trial name or comparator vaccine brand is specified.",
