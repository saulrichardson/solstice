  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Forest plot displaying relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) across several subgroups: PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. Within each outcome, subgroups include cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, and any of the above conditions. Data points and horizontal CI bars are plotted on a percentage axis ranging from \u201350% to +55%, with a vertical reference line at 0%. The figure shows relative vaccine effectiveness across clinical subgroups but does not name the vaccines compared or indicate that Flublok quadrivalent was evaluated against Fluarix quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The plot lacks any vaccine names or labels indicating which vaccines were compared; conclusions are limited to what is visible in the figure.",
