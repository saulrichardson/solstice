  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic diagram showing nine KPNC facilities of various sizes grouped into service areas, randomly assigned to Block A or Block B based on size matching, and a table illustrating alternating weekly administration of SD-IIV4 (standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent) and RIV4 (recombinant influenza vaccine quadrivalent) over four weeks. The figure describes operational assignment of SD-IIV4 versus RIV4 across facilities and does not name Fluarix nor describe a pivotal trial comparing Flublok (RIV4) to Fluarix. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The figure shows only SD-IIV4 without specifying brand and depicts a routine alternating strategy rather than a pivotal trial; image quality is sufficient to discern labels.",
