  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Diagram and table showing a cluster-randomized crossover design in which Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities, matched by size into Block A or B, alternated weekly between SD-IIV4 (standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine) and RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine) over four weeks. The image depicts a practical alternating-week vaccine assignment (SD-IIV4 vs RIV4) in health care facilities and does not name Flublok or Fluarix or describe a pivotal trial comparison, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No brand names or pivotal trial context are provided; evidence is limited to a pragmatic cluster crossover design.",
