  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Diagram of Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities randomized into two blocks, with a table showing alternating weekly administration of RIV4 (quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine) and SD-IIV4 (quadrivalent standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines) across facilities over four weeks. Evidence: The figure displays alternating use of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 but does not name Flublok or Fluarix. The image presents a generic comparison between RIV4 and SD-IIV4 without specifying the brands Flublok or Fluarix, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image only uses generic vaccine abbreviations, no brand names provided.",
