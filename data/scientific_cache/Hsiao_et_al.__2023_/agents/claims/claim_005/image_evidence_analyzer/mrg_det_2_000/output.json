  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel schematic showing: 1) a service area with nine facilities of various sizes; 2) similar\u2013sized facilities paired and randomized into Block A or Block B; and 3) a table listing weekly alternating administration of SD-IIV4 and RIV4 across four weeks for each facility. The figure depicts cluster randomization of facilities and weekly alternation between SD-IIV4 and RIV4 vaccines but does not mention Flublok or Fluarix by name or indicate a pivotal trial comparing Flublok (quadrivalent) against Fluarix (quadrivalent). Therefore, this does not support the claim. Note: Brand names and pivotal trial context are not shown; interpretation limited to visible labels SD-IIV4 and RIV4.",
