  "explanation": "A two-arm flowchart showing how many adults aged 18\u201364 years received a recombinant vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine across three influenza seasons (2018\u20132019, 2019\u20132020, 2020\u20132021) and how many were excluded at each step (non-members, inpatient vaccinations, out-of-range dates, missing facility identifiers, etc.), culminating in final cohort sizes for each group. The figure does not support the claim because it only labels groups as \"recombinant vaccine\" and \"standard-dose vaccine\" without naming Flublok or Fluarix or indicating a pivotal trial comparison between these specific products, so it doesn't support the claim. Note: Based solely on the visible flowchart; no brand names or trial details are specified.",
