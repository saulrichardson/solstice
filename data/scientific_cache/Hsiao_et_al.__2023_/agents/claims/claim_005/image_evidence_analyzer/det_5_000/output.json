  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart illustrating the selection of 18\u201364-year-old participants vaccinated over the 2018\u20132019, 2019\u20132020, and 2020\u20132021 seasons. It splits 2,776,278 vaccinated individuals into those who received a recombinant vaccine (n=1,018,043) and those who received a standard-dose vaccine (n=1,758,235). Each branch shows successive exclusions (non-members, inpatient vaccinations, out-of-range dates, missing facility identifiers, unassigned propensity scores) leading to final cohorts of 632,962 recombinant vaccine recipients and 997,366 standard-dose vaccine recipients, with age breakdowns. does not support the claim because the figure presents an observational cohort flowchart without naming specific products or describing a pivotal trial comparing Flublok quadrivalent against Fluarix quadrivalent. Note: The figure does not label vaccine products by brand and appears to represent real-world data over multiple seasons rather than a randomized pivotal trial; context may be limited by cropped or omitted text.",
