  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-arm flowchart showing numbers of 18\u201364-year-old participants vaccinated over three influenza seasons, split into those receiving a ''recombinant vaccine'' (left) and those receiving a ''standard-dose vaccine'' (right), with successive exclusions (non-members, inpatient vaccinations, out-of-range dates, missing facility identifiers, etc.) leading to final cohort sizes for each arm. does not support the claim because the figure does not mention Flublok or Fluarix by name and appears to depict an observational cohort selection process rather than a pivotal trial comparing Flublok (quadrivalent) against Fluarix (quadrivalent). Note: Brand names and trial context are not visible; the figure appears to reflect retrospective cohort attrition rather than a randomized pivotal trial.",
