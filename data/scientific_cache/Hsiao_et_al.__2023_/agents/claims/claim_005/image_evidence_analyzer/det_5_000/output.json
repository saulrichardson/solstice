  "explanation": "Flowchart diagram showing the selection of 2,776,278 participants aged 18\u201364 years vaccinated over three seasons (2018\u20132021), split into those who received a recombinant vaccine (n\u22481,018,043) and those who received a standard-dose vaccine (n\u22481,758,235), followed by exclusions for membership, inpatient vaccinations, date range, facility identifiers, propensity score assignment, and season-specific vaccinations, resulting in final cohorts for recombinant (n=632,962) and standard-dose (n=997,366) vaccines. The figure does not mention Flublok or Fluarix by name, nor does it describe a randomized pivotal trial comparing quadrivalent recombinant vaccine with quadrivalent standard-dose Fluarix; it presents an observational cohort selection process and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The flowchart text is clear but no brand names or trial design details are given; analysis limited to visible content.",
