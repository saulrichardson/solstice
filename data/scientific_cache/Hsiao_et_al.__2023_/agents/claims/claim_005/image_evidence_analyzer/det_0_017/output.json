The image only displays the article title and authors without naming specific vaccines such as Flublok or Fluarix or indicating a quadrivalent comparison, so it does not support the claim. Note: Only the title page is visible; details about specific vaccine comparisons may appear elsewhere in the document but are not shown here.",
