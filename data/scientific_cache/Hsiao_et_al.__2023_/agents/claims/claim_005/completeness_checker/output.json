      "quote": "METHODS In this cluster randomized observational study, Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities routinely administered either a high dose recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) or one of two standard dose influenza vaccines during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 influenza seasons to adults 50 to 64 years of age (primary age group) and 18 to 49 years of age. Each facility alternated weekly between the two vaccine formulations. The primary outcome was influenza (A or B) confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.",
