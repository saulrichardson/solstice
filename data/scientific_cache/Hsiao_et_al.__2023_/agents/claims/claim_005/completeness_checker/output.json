Each facility alternated weekly between the two vaccine formulations. The primary outcome was influenza (A or B) confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.",

The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. To estimate the relative effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine as compared with standard dose vaccines against laboratory confirmed influenza and influenza related outcomes, we compared the two formulations of vaccines among members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health care system who were between 18 and 64 years of age during the two influenza seasons of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020.",

The 2019-2020 season was truncated in March 2020 because of the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine was donated by Sanofi, and the two standard dose vaccines used during the study seasons were purchased by KPNC.",
