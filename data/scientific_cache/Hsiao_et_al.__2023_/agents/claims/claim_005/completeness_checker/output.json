      "quote": "METHODS In this cluster randomized observational study, Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities routinely administered either a high dose recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) or one of two standard dose influenza vaccines during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 influenza seasons to adults 50 to 64 years of age (primary age group) and 18 to 49 years of age. Each facility alternated weekly between the two vaccine formulations. The primary outcome was influenza (A or B) confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.",

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. To estimate the relative effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine as compared with standard dose vaccines against laboratory confirmed influenza and influenza related outcomes, we compared the two formulations of vaccines among members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health care system who were between 18 and 64 years of age during the two influenza seasons of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020.",

The 2019-2020 season was truncated in March 2020 because of the outbreak of the coronavirus. The KPNC system includes seven geographic regions, each containing 8 to 12 medical facilities. In each region, the facilities were assigned to either Block A or Block B to optimize the balance between blocks with respect to facility size (Fig. 1). We randomly assigned Block A to start with administration of a standard dose vaccine and Block B to start with administration of the recombinant vaccine. Thereafter, each facility alternated the administration of the two vaccines weekly.",
