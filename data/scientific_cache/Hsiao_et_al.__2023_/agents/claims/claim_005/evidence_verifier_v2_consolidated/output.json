The wording is nearly identical, with only minor differences in phrasing (e.g., 'high dose recombinant vaccine' instead of 'Flublok Quadrivalent'), but the meaning and factual content are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the study compared the effectiveness of a high dose recombinant vaccine (which, per the document, is Flublok Quadrivalent) with standard dose vaccines. The document also clarifies elsewhere that Flublok Quadrivalent was the recombinant vaccine used, and Fluarix (a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine) was among the standard dose comparators. Therefore, the quote genuinely affirms that Flublok Quadrivalent was evaluated in the pivotal trial against a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine.",

This confirms that Flublok quadrivalent was evaluated against a standard dose vaccine in the pivotal trial, as the claim asserts. The quote also describes the study design in a way that substantiates the head-to-head comparison between these two vaccine types.",
