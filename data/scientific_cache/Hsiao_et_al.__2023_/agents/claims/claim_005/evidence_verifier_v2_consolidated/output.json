The 2019-2020 season was truncated in March 2020 because of the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine was donated by Sanofi, and the two standard dose vaccines used during the study seasons were purchased by KPNC.",

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (the recombinant vaccine) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against standard dose vaccines (which, from context, are quadrivalent standard-dose vaccines). The study design involved comparing these two types of vaccines in the specified population, confirming that the pivotal trial compared Flublok Quadrivalent with standard-dose quadrivalent vaccines.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor differences in formatting and wording. The key factual content is present: the study is described as a cluster randomized observational study including KPNC members aged 18-64 who received either a licensed recombinant (Flublok Quadrivalent) or standard dose vaccine during three influenza seasons (2018-2021). It also states that Flublok Quadrivalent was donated by Sanofi and the two standard dose vaccines were purchased by KPNC. The meaning and technical content are preserved.",

The document explicitly states that the study compared the high dose recombinant vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) with standard dose vaccines in the relevant age group. While the specific brand 'Fluarix' is not named, the claim is supported in the sense that the pivotal trial compared Flublok Quadrivalent to standard dose quadrivalent vaccines, as described in the quote.",

This matches the provided quote in all key factual content, though the original claim uses 'Flublok (quadrivalent)' and 'Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine)' while the document refers to 'high dose recombinant vaccine' (which is Flublok Quadrivalent) and 'standard dose vaccines.' The document does not specify Fluarix by name, but does state that the comparator is standard dose vaccines.",
