It explicitly states that the study compared the recombinant vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) to a standard dose vaccine in participants aged 50 to 64 years, and found greater protection in the recombinant vaccine group. The document also details that the study was a head-to-head comparison between Flublok Quadrivalent and standard dose quadrivalent vaccines, confirming the claim's accuracy.",

The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor differences in punctuation and formatting, but the factual content is preserved.",
