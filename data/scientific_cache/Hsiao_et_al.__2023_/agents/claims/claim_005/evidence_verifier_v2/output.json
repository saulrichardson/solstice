The methods and results sections of the document confirm that the recombinant vaccine used was Flublok Quadrivalent and that the comparator was a standard dose quadrivalent vaccine (Fluarix or similar). Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
