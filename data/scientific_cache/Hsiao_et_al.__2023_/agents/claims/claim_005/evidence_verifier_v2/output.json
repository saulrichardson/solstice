The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the study compared the effectiveness of a high dose recombinant vaccine (which, per the document, is Flublok Quadrivalent) with standard dose vaccines. The document also clarifies elsewhere that Flublok Quadrivalent was the recombinant vaccine used, and Fluarix (a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine) was among the standard dose comparators. Therefore, the quote genuinely affirms that Flublok Quadrivalent was evaluated in the pivotal trial against a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine.",

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. To estimate the relative effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine as compared with standard dose vaccines against laboratory confirmed influenza and influenza related outcomes, we compared the two formulations of vaccines among members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health care system who were between 18 and 64 years of age during the two influenza seasons of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020.",

The 2019-2020 season was truncated in March 2020 because of the outbreak of the coronavirus. The KPNC system includes seven geographic regions, each containing 8 to 12 medical facilities. In each region, the facilities were assigned to either Block A or Block B to optimize the balance between blocks with respect to facility size (Fig. 1). We randomly assigned Block A to start with administration of a standard dose vaccine and Block B to start with administration of the recombinant vaccine. Thereafter, each facility alternated the administration of the two vaccines weekly.",
