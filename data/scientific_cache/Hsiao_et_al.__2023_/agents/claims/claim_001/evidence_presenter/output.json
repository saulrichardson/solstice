      "quote": "BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. Data are needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines against influenza related outcomes in adults under the age ABSTR ACT g Amber Hsiao, Ph. D., M. P. H., Arnold Yee, M. B. A., Bruce Fireman, M. A., John Hansen, M. P. H., Ned Lewis, M. P. H., and Nicola P. Klein, M. D., Ph. D.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines. Additionally, elsewhere in the document, it is stated that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies, which relates to greater immunogenicity. Therefore, the quote and the surrounding context in the document genuinely support the claim."

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, and that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. This links the higher HA content to greater immunogenicity, as the claim asserts. No inference is required; the document makes the connection clear."
