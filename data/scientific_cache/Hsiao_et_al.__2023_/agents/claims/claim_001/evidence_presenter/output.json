      "quote": "BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the following form: 'BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' This matches the quoted text in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').. The quote directly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines, which supports the first part of the claim. Additionally, elsewhere in the document, it is stated that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies, which is a measure of immunogenicity. Therefore, the quote, in conjunction with the surrounding context, genuinely supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines and that this has been linked to greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document on page 2, with only minor formatting differences. The relevant passage is: 'The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.' This matches the quote to verify in all substantive facts and numbers.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, and that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. This supports both parts of the claim: the higher antigen content and the link to greater immunogenicity (as measured by protective antibodies) compared to standard-dose flu vaccines."

      "quote": "During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accord with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 10 of the document, with only minor differences in wording. The document states: 'During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accord with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.' This matches the quote to be verified in both meaning and technical content.. The quote directly links the observed benefit (i.e., higher effectiveness) of the recombinant vaccine to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen. This supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen of standard-dose vaccines and that this increased HA content is associated with greater immunogenicity and effectiveness. The document also explicitly states in the background that the recombinant vaccine contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, and that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim."
