      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the following form: 'BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' This matches the quoted text in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').. The quote directly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines, which supports the first part of the claim. Additionally, elsewhere in the document, it is stated that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies, which is a measure of immunogenicity. Therefore, the quote, in conjunction with the surrounding context, genuinely supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines and that this has been linked to greater immunogenicity.",
