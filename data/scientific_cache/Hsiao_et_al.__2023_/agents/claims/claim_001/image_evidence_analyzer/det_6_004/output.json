  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, coexisting illnesses, prior influenza vaccination) of participants receiving a recombinant vaccine (N=279,400) versus a standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852). The table only presents participant demographics and clinical baseline characteristics and provides no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table is clear but contains no data on HA antigen amounts or immunogenicity outcomes.",
