  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, coexisting illnesses, prior influenza vaccination) of participants receiving either a recombinant influenza vaccine (N=279,400) or a standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852), with counts and percentages. The table only presents participant demographics and clinical characteristics for recombinant versus standard-dose vaccine groups and does not provide any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis is limited to visible table content; no antigen concentration or immunogenicity data are present.",
