  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants (age, sex, race/ethnicity, preexisting conditions, prior influenza vaccination) broken down by vaccine group (recombinant vaccine vs standard-dose vaccine vs all vaccines). The table only lists participant demographics and clinical characteristics by vaccine group; it does not include any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear but does not address antigen content; no additional context on HA dosage is provided.",
