  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Partial page from a clinical article titled 'Recombinant or Standard-Dose Influenza Vaccine in Adults under 65 Years of Age,' showing the abstract stating: 'trivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines\u2026' Evidence: \u2018trivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines\u2019 The image shows that the recombinant vaccine has 3\u00d7 the HA antigen content of standard-dose vaccines but does not present any data or statement linking this increased antigen content to greater immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim in full. Note: Text is partially cut off and no immunogenicity results are visible",
