  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing (1) a map-like schematic of 9 Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities of varying sizes within a service area, (2) grouping of similarly sized facilities into two randomized blocks (A and B), and (3) a table listing each facility, its block assignment, and the weekly alternation of two vaccine formulations labeled SD-IIV4 (standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine) and RIV4 (quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine) over four weeks. The figure describes the cluster randomization design and weekly alternation of SD-IIV4 versus RIV4 across facilities but does not present any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or its comparison (e.g., 3\u00d7 HA content) nor link antigen dose to immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The text and table are legible and clear; no information on HA antigen content or immunogenicity is provided in this figure.",
