  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic showing (1) KPNC service area facilities of various sizes represented by labeled rectangles (Facility 1\u20139), (2) random assignment of similarly sized facilities into Block A or Block B with arrows linking matched facilities, and (3) a table listing each facility\u2019s block and its Week 1\u20134 alternating vaccination schedule (SD-IIV4 vs RIV4). does not support the claim because the figure only shows facility randomization and vaccine schedule (standard-dose inactivated vs recombinant quadrivalent) and does not present any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative immunogenicity.",
