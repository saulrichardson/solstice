  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing outcomes among recipients of a recombinant influenza vaccine (N=279,400) versus a standard-dose influenza vaccine (N=395,852), showing cases per 1000 for primary (PCR-confirmed influenza) and secondary outcomes, unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios, and relative vaccine effectiveness percentages with 95% CIs and P values. The table provides clinical effectiveness data and relative vaccine effectiveness but contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, and thus does not support the claim.",
