  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing the recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok) to the standard\u2010dose egg\u2010based vaccine, showing number of cases per 1,000, unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios, relative vaccine effectiveness percentages, and P values for outcomes such as PCR\u2010confirmed influenza (A and B) and various hospitalizations. The table reports comparative clinical effectiveness data (cases, rate ratios, vaccine effectiveness) but does not present any information about hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity measures; therefore, it does not support the claim.",
