  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing clinical outcomes in two vaccine groups (Flublok, N=279,400; standard-dose vaccine, N=395,852). It lists primary and secondary outcomes (PCR-confirmed influenza A and B, hospitalizations) with number of cases per 1000, unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios, vaccine effectiveness percentages, and P values. does not support the claim because the table provides clinical outcome and effectiveness data but contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or a comparison of antigen doses. Note: Analysis limited to visible table; image quality is sufficient but antigen content details are not present.",
