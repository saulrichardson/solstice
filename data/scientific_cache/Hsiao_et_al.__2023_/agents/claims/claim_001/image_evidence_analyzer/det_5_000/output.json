  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A flowchart showing the number of participants aged 18\u201364 vaccinated over three flu seasons, stratified into those receiving a recombinant (Flublok) vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine, with successive exclusions leading to final cohort sizes. does not support the claim because the image only presents participant flow and cohort selection data and contains no information on HA antigen content or immunogenicity comparisons.",
