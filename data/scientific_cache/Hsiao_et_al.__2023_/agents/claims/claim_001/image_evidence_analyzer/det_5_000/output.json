  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart showing selection of study participants aged 18\u201364 vaccinated during the 2018\u20132021 seasons, split into those who received a recombinant (Flublok) vaccine and those who received a standard-dose vaccine, with successive exclusion steps and final cohort sizes listed for each group. The figure only presents participant counts and exclusion criteria for recombinant versus standard-dose vaccine cohorts; it does not provide any information about hemagglutinin antigen content or relative dosing, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited by image content showing only cohort selection flow; no mention of HA antigen levels.",
