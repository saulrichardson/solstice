  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart showing the number of study participants aged 18\u201364 vaccinated in each flu season (2018\u20132021), divided into those receiving a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine, with sequential exclusion criteria leading to the final analytic cohorts and age breakdowns. The figure is a participant flow diagram and does not provide any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: None",
