  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) of a recombinant influenza vaccine versus standard-dose vaccines across various subgroups (PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia) and risk categories (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above). The image presents relative effectiveness data by clinical outcome and risk subgroup but does not provide any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or direct measures of immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clear but focused solely on vaccine effectiveness outcomes, with no mention of HA antigen doses or immunogenicity metrics.",
