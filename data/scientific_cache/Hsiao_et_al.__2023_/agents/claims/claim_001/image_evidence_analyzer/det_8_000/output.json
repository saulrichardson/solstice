  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A forest plot summarizing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) for various clinical endpoints (PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia) across subgroups (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above conditions). The x-axis shows percentage effectiveness relative to a comparator. The figure presents relative vaccine effectiveness data across clinical subgroups and does not provide any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim about Flublok having 3\u00d7 the HA antigen content linked to greater immunogenicity. Note: Resolution of the image is sufficient to see all subgroup labels and data; however, no antigen content or immunogenicity metrics are shown.",
