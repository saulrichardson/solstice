  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% CIs) of a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose influenza vaccine among participants aged 50\u201364, stratified by preexisting conditions and outcomes (PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia). The figure presents subgroup analyses of relative vaccine effectiveness, but it does not provide any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or its comparison (e.g., 3\u00d7 HA) between Flublok and standard-dose vaccines, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear regarding effectiveness outcomes but contains no information on antigen content or immunogenicity differences related to HA quantity.",
