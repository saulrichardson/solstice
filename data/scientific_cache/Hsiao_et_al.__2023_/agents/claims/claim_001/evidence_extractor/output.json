      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein compared to standard dose vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim."

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote confirms that Flublok contains three times the hemagglutinin protein of standard dose vaccines and that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies, supporting both the antigen content and the link to greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "Several studies have shown benefit for the recombinant vaccine and other high dose influenza vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or older, findings that have been attributed to an improved immune response.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that the improved immune response (greater immunogenicity) of recombinant and high dose vaccines compared to standard dose vaccines has been observed in studies, supporting the second part of the claim."

    {
      "id": 4,
      "quote": "During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accord with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote links the higher effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen, directly supporting the claim that increased HA content is associated with greater immunogenicity and effectiveness."
