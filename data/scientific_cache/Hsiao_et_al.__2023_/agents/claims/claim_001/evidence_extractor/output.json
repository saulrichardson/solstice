      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote confirms that Flublok contains three times the hemagglutinin protein of standard dose vaccines and links this higher antigen content to increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies, supporting the claim that higher HA content is associated with greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "Several studies have shown benefit for the recombinant vaccine and other high dose influenza vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or older, findings that have been attributed to an improved immune response.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that the improved immune response (greater immunogenicity) of recombinant and high dose vaccines compared to standard dose vaccines has been observed in studies, supporting the second part of the claim."
