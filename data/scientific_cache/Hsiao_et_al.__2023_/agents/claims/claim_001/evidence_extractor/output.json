      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein compared to standard dose vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim."

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote confirms that Flublok contains three times the hemagglutinin protein of standard dose vaccines and links this higher antigen content to increased protective antibodies, supporting both the antigen content and immunogenicity aspects of the claim."

      "quote": "Several studies have shown benefit for the recombinant vaccine and other high dose influenza vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or older, findings that have been attributed to an improved immune response.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that higher dose (including recombinant) vaccines are associated with improved immune response compared to standard dose vaccines, supporting the claim that greater antigen content is linked to greater immunogenicity."

      "quote": "In this study performed during two influenza seasons, participants between the ages of 50 and 64 years who received the recombinant vaccine had more protection against confirmed influenza than those who received a standard dose vaccine.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that the recombinant vaccine (with higher HA content) provided more protection than standard dose vaccines, supporting the link between higher antigen content and greater immunogenicity/effectiveness."
