The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",

      "quote": "A strength of our study is that the two study vaccine formulations were alternated in weekly intervals of time at each facility, which allowed us to balance covariates of interest as designed. In every KPNC geographic area, when influenza arrived, there were already participants who had received one of the two formulations of vaccine and who were similar with respect to demographic characteristics, coexisting illnesses, handling of potential confounding bias has not been formally studied. Our intent was to minimize imbalances between the participants who received each vaccine, both within and between facilities. We also included several sensitivity analyses to address potential biases from clustering according to facility. Sensitivity analyses that were stratified either according to facility or week (to compare between facilities) showed a relative vaccine effectiveness of approximately 15%, similar to the findings of our primary analysis.",

      "quote": "In the current study, we compared the effectiveness of the high dose recombinant vaccine with that of standard dose vaccines in patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years. The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3 N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3 N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly links the higher effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen, supporting the claim that increased HA content is associated with greater immunogenicity and protection.",
