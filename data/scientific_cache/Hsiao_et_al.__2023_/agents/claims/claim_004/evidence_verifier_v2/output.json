The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor differences in formatting and spacing (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadivalent'), but all factual content and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines. This is a key mechanistic fact supporting the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines, as hemagglutinin content is directly related to immunogenicity. While the quote does not explicitly state that the antibody response is more robust, it provides the specific factual basis (higher antigen dose) that underpins the claim, and thus genuinely supports it.",

      "quote": "The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 10 of the document, with only minor differences in wording and structure. The key factual content is preserved: the effectiveness of standard dose vaccines, the issue of antigenic drift in egg-based manufacturing, the lack of such drift in recombinant vaccines, the California Department of Public Health data about H3N2 circulation and mismatch, and the conclusion that the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine is more likely due to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen. The document states: 'The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3 N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season 18 and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines 19 20 During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3 N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overll in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.'. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine compared to the standard dose vaccine is in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen. This links the higher dose in the recombinant vaccine to greater effectiveness, which is consistent with the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines. The document also notes that increased hemagglutinin antigen is correlated with increased protective antibodies, further supporting the claim.",
