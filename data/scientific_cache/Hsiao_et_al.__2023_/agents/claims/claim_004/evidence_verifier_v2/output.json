      "quote": "The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3 N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3 N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",

This directly supports the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines, as it links the higher dose of antigen in the recombinant vaccine to increased effectiveness.",
