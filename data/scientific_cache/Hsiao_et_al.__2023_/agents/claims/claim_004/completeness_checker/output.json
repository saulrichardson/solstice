Data are needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines against influenza related outcomes in adults under the age.",

The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",

      "quote": "A strength of our study is that the two study vaccine formulations were alternated in weekly intervals of time at each facility, which allowed us to balance covariates of interest as designed. In every KPNC geographic area, when influenza arrived, there were already participants who had received one of the two formulations of vaccine and who were similar with respect to demographic characteristics, coexisting illnesses, and gall associated with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote highlights that the study design allowed for a fair comparison between the high-dose recombinant and standard-dose vaccines, specifically noting the higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen in the recombinant vaccine, which is directly relevant to the claim about inducing a more robust antibody response.",

      "quote": "The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3 N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3 N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by attributing the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine over the standard-dose vaccine to its higher dose of hemagglutinin, which is linked to a more robust immune response.",
