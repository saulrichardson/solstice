      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the recombinant vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains three times the hemagglutinin protein compared to standard dose vaccines, and that this increased level has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. This directly addresses the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines, as it links the higher dose to a stronger antibody response.",

      "quote": "The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines. During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine compared to the standard dose vaccine is likely due to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen. This higher dose is linked to increased effectiveness, which implies a more robust antibody response, as hemagglutinin is the primary immunogenic component of the flu vaccine. The document also notes earlier that increased hemagglutinin content is correlated with increased protective antibodies. Thus, the quote provides direct, explicit support for the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 10 of the document, with only minor differences in wording and formatting. The key factual content is preserved: the effectiveness of standard dose vaccines, the issue of antigenic drift in egg-based manufacturing, the recombinant vaccine's lack of susceptibility to such drift, the California Department of Public Health data about H3N2, and the conclusion that the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine is more likely due to its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen. The passage in the document reads: 'The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3 N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season 18 and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines 19 20 During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3 N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall, in accordance with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.'",
