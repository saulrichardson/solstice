      "quote": "Quadivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. Data are needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines against influenza related outcomes in adults under the age.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that the recombinant vaccine has a higher dose of hemagglutinin protein, which is a key antigen for inducing antibody responses, directly supporting the claim that the higher-dose recombinant vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines."

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that the higher dose of hemagglutinin in the recombinant vaccine has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies, directly supporting the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response."

      "quote": "For the primary objective, the relative vaccine effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine as compared with standard dose vaccines against all PCR-confirmed influenza was 15.3% (95% CI, 5.9 to 23.8; P = 0.002). The estimate of relative vaccine effectiveness for the secondary objective of PCR-confirmed influenza A was 15.7% (95% CI, 6.0 to 24.5; P = 0.002).",
