Data are needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines against influenza related outcomes in adults under the age.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that the recombinant vaccine has a higher dose of hemagglutinin protein, which is a key antigen for inducing antibody responses, directly supporting the claim that a higher-dose recombinant vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines."

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that the higher dose of hemagglutinin in the recombinant vaccine has been correlated with increased protective antibodies, directly supporting the claim that the higher-dose recombinant vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response."

      "quote": "Several studies have shown benefit for the recombinant vaccine and other high dose influenza vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or older, findings that have been attributed to an improved immune response.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote references studies showing that high-dose and recombinant vaccines provide greater benefit than standard-dose vaccines, attributing this to an improved immune response, which supports the claim regarding a more robust antibody response."
