      "quote": "Quadivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. Data are needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines against influenza related outcomes in adults under the age.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that the recombinant vaccine has a higher dose of hemagglutinin protein than standard egg-based vaccines, which is a key mechanistic basis for expecting a more robust antibody response."

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly links the higher hemagglutinin content in the recombinant vaccine to increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies, supporting the claim that a higher-dose recombinant vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response."

      "quote": "Several studies have shown benefit for the recombinant vaccine and other high dose influenza vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or older, findings that have been attributed to an improved immune response.",

      "quote": "In this study performed during two influenza seasons, participants between the ages of 50 and 64 years who received the recombinant vaccine had more protection against confirmed influenza than those who received a standard dose vaccine.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence from the study that the recombinant vaccine (which is higher dose) conferred more protection, implying a more robust immune response compared to standard-dose vaccines."

The estimate of relative vaccine effectiveness for the secondary objective of PCR-confirmed influenza A was 15.7% (95% CI, 6.0 to 24.5; P = 0.002).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides quantitative data showing that the recombinant vaccine was more effective than the standard-dose vaccine, which supports the claim that it induces a more robust antibody response."
