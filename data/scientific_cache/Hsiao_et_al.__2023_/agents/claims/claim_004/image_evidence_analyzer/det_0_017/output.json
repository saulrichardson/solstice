  "claim_id": "claim_004",
  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image shows the title of a clinical article ('Recombinant or Standard-Dose Influenza Vaccine in Adults under 65 Years of Age'), author names, the 'ABSTRACT' heading, and the beginning of the abstract text stating that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines. Evidence: Statement that recombinant vaccines contain three times the hemagglutinin protein compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines. The image does not support the claim because it provides only antigen dose information without any data on antibody responses or comparative immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The abstract text is partially visible and cut off, so immunogenicity results may appear later but are not shown in this image.",
