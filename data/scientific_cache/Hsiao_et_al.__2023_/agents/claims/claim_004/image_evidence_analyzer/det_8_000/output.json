  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A forest plot of relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI) comparing two influenza vaccines across various subgroups (PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia) and comorbidity categories (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any condition). Each subgroup has a point estimate and confidence interval plotted on a percentage scale from \u201350% to +55%. The figure presents clinical effectiveness outcomes (relative reduction in confirmed influenza and hospitalizations) rather than immunogenicity or antibody titer measurements, and therefore does not support the claim about a more robust antibody response. Note: The image is clear but focuses on vaccine effectiveness endpoints, not serologic or immunologic data.",
