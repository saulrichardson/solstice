  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Forest plot of subgroup analysis showing relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI) of a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose egg-based vaccine against PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia in participants aged 50\u201364 years, stratified by preexisting conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above). The figure presents clinical effectiveness outcomes (relative vaccine effectiveness) by subgroup, not immunogenicity or antibody\u2010response data. Therefore, it doesn't support the claim about a more robust antibody response and does not support the claim.",
