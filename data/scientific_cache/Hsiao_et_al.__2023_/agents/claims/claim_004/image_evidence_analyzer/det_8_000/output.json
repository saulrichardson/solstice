  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% CI) for various clinical subgroups (PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia) and comorbid conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above). Each subgroup has a point estimate and horizontal error bar plotted on a percentage scale from \u201350% to +55%. The figure presents clinical effectiveness estimates (relative reduction in influenza or pneumonia outcomes) across subgroups, but does not show any data on antibody titers or immunogenicity. Therefore, this image does not support the claim about inducing a more robust antibody response. Note: Analysis limited to what is visible; image resolution is sufficient to determine that antibody response data are not presented.",
