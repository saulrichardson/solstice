  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) for different clinical outcomes\u2014PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia\u2014across various patient subgroups (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, and any of the above). The x-axis shows percentage relative effectiveness ranging from \u201350% to +55%, with most estimates favoring the comparator vaccine. does not support the claim because the figure reports clinical vaccine effectiveness outcomes rather than any measures of antibody response or immunogenicity comparing higher-dose recombinant and egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody titer data are presented; the specific vaccines compared are not explicitly labeled in the figure.",
