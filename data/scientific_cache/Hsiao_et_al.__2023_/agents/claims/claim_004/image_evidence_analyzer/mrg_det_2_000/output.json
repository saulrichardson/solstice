  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic showing 9 KPNC facilities of varying sizes grouped into two blocks (A and B) based on similar size and then randomized to alternating weekly vaccination with SD-IIV4 (egg-based standard-dose quadrivalent) or RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent) over four illustrative weeks. It includes block diagrams and a table indicating which vaccine each facility administered in weeks 1\u20134. does not support the claim because the figure only depicts the cluster-randomized scheduling of SD-IIV4 versus RIV4 across facilities and provides no data on antibody responses or immunogenicity to compare the robustness of the immune response between higher-dose recombinant and egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: Analysis limited to what is visible in the schematic; no outcome or immunogenicity data are shown.",
