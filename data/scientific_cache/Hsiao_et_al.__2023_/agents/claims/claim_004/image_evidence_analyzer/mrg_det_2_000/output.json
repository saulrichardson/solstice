  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Three-part figure showing: 1) a schematic of a Kaiser Permanente Northern California service area containing facilities of various sizes labeled Facility 1\u20139; 2) matching of similarly sized facilities into Block A and Block B with arrows indicating pairs; 3) a table listing each facility, its block assignment, and a 4-week schedule alternating two vaccine formulations (SD-IIV4 in yellow and RIV4 in blue) administered weekly. The figure only depicts the randomization and alternating weekly administration schedule of standard-dose egg-based (SD-IIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines across facilities. It does not present any antibody response or immunogenicity data, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Figure shows study design and vaccine scheduling only; no direct immunogenicity or antibody titer results are provided.",
