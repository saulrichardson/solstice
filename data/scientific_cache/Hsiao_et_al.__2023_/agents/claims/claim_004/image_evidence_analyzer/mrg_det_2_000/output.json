  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic illustrating the Kaiser Permanente Northern California service area facilities of various sizes, their assignment into two randomization blocks (Block A and Block B) based on similar facility size, and a table showing weekly alternating assignment of quadrivalent standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) and quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) across nine facilities over four weeks. The image solely depicts the cluster randomization design and weekly vaccine allocation schedule (SD-IIV4 versus RIV4) without any presentation of immunogenicity or antibody response data, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No antibody response or clinical outcome data are visible; the figure focuses only on study design and vaccine assignment.",
