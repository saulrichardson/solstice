  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Diagram showing service\u2010area facilities grouped by size, randomized into two blocks (A and B), and a 4-week alternating schedule of vaccine administration (standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) versus recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4)) for each facility. The figure presents the study's cluster randomization and weekly alternation between SD-IIV4 and RIV4 across facilities but contains no immunogenicity or antibody response data; it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; no data on antibody titers or immunogenicity are presented.",
