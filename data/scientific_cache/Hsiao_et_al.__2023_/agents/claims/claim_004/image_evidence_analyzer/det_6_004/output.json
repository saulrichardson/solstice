  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, coexisting illnesses, prior influenza vaccination) of participants who received a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine, with counts and percentages for each group. The table only presents participant baseline characteristics and does not include any immunogenicity or antibody-response data, so it doesn't support the claim regarding a more robust antibody response. Note: Analysis limited by absence of any immunogenicity or serologic results in the provided image.",
