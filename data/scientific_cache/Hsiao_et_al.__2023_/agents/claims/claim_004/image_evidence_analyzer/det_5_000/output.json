  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flow diagram showing the selection of study participants aged 18\u201364 years for two vaccine groups (recombinant vaccine and standard-dose egg-based vaccine) over three influenza seasons, with stepwise exclusions (non-members, inpatient vaccinations, outside date range, missing facility identifier, missing propensity score) leading to final cohorts: 632,962 in the recombinant group and 997,366 in the standard-dose group, each stratified by age (18\u201349 and 50\u201364 years). The figure only presents participant flow and cohort sizes for recipients of recombinant versus standard-dose vaccines; it contains no data on antibody responses or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear in showing cohort selection but provides no immunologic or antibody titer data, so conclusions about antibody response cannot be drawn.",
