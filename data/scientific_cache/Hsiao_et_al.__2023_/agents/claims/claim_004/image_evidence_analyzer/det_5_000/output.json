  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart diagram detailing the selection and exclusion of study participants aged 18\u201364 who received either a recombinant influenza vaccine (N starting at 1,018,043) or a standard-dose egg-based vaccine (N starting at 1,758,235) over three seasons (2018\u20132021). Boxes show successive exclusions (non-members, inpatient vaccinations, outside date range, missing identifiers, unassigned scores) and final cohort sizes (632,962 recombinant vs. 997,366 standard-dose). The figure only shows participant flow and cohort sizes for recombinant versus standard-dose vaccines and does not present any antibody response or immunogenicity data, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible, but it contains no data on antibody titers or immune response.",
