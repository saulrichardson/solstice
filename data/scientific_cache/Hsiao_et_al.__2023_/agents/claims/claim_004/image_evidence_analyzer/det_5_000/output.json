  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the selection and exclusion of study participants aged 18\u201364 years vaccinated over three influenza seasons (2018\u20132021), comparing those who received a recombinant vaccine (n \u22481,018,043 initially, 632,962 in final cohort) versus a standard-dose vaccine (n \u22481,758,235 initially, 997,366 in final cohort), with stepwise exclusions for nonmembers, inpatient vaccinations, outside date ranges, missing facility identifiers, and inability to assign propensity scores. The image is a participant flow diagram and does not present any data on antibody responses or immunogenicity; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to confirm that no immunogenicity or antibody response data are shown.",
