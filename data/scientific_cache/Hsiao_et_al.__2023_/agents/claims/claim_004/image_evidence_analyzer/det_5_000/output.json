  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the selection and exclusion of participants aged 18\u201364 years across three flu seasons who received either a recombinant influenza vaccine (1,018,043 initially; 632,962 in the final cohort) or a standard\u2010dose egg\u2010based vaccine (1,758,235 initially; 997,366 in the final cohort), with stepwise exclusions for nonmembers, inpatient vaccinations, off\u2010date vaccinations, missing facility identifiers, and missing propensity scores, and final age\u2010group breakdowns. The figure is a participant flow diagram showing enrollment and exclusions; it does not present any antibody titers or immunogenicity comparisons and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Figure quality is clear; no immunogenicity data are present in this image.",
