  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing outcomes for recombinant vaccine (N=279,400) versus standard-dose egg-based vaccine (N=395,852), showing number of cases per 1,000, unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs, relative vaccine effectiveness percentages, and p values for PCR-confirmed influenza (primary outcome) and several secondary outcomes including influenza A, influenza B, and various hospitalizations. The table presents clinical effectiveness data (incidence rates, hazard ratios, and relative vaccine effectiveness) but contains no measurements of antibody titers or immunogenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim that a higher-dose recombinant vaccine induces a more robust antibody response. Note: The table is clear and complete for clinical endpoints; lack of antibody data is evident.",
