  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing clinical outcomes between recipients of high-dose recombinant influenza vaccine (N=279,400) and standard-dose egg-based influenza vaccine (N=395,852), showing the number of PCR-confirmed influenza cases per 1000, rate ratios (unadjusted and adjusted), vaccine effectiveness percentages with 95% CIs, and p-values for primary and secondary outcomes. The table presents real-world clinical effectiveness (reduction in PCR-confirmed influenza cases) but contains no data on antibody titers or immunogenicity. Therefore it does not support the claim regarding a more robust antibody response with the higher-dose recombinant vaccine. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody response data are provided; conclusions are based solely on clinical outcome measures.",
