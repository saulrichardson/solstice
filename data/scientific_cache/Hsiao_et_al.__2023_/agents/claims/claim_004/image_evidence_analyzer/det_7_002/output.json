  "claim_id": "claim_004",
  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing outcomes for recipients of a higher-dose recombinant influenza vaccine (N=279,400) versus an egg-based standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852). Columns show numbers of cases per 1,000 persons for PCR-confirmed influenza (primary outcome) and several secondary outcomes (influenza A, influenza B, hospitalizations), along with unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% CI), relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% CI), and P values. Evidence: Primary outcome: PCR-confirmed influenza cases per 1,000 were 2.00 for recombinant vs 2.34 for standard-dose, adjusted hazard ratio 0.85 (0.76\u20130.94), relative vaccine effectiveness 15.3% (5.9\u201323.8), P=0.002. The table provides clinical effectiveness data but does not include any measurements of antibody titers or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim regarding a more robust antibody response with the higher-dose recombinant vaccine. Note: The table is clear and data are readable, but limited to clinical outcome measures; immunogenicity or serologic response data are not presented.",
