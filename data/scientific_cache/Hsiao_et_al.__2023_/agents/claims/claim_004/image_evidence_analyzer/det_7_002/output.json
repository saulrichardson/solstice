  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing clinical outcomes in adults receiving a higher-dose recombinant influenza vaccine (N=279,400) versus a standard-dose egg-based vaccine (N=395,852). The table lists the number of PCR-confirmed influenza cases and hospitalizations per 1,000 persons, unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI), relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI), and P values for primary and secondary outcomes. The table presents clinical effectiveness outcomes (PCR-confirmed influenza cases and hospitalizations) and relative vaccine effectiveness, but contains no data on antibody titers or immunogenicity measures. Therefore, it does not support the claim about a more robust antibody response. Note: Analysis is limited to what is visible; the table is focused on clinical endpoints, not serologic or immunogenicity data.",
