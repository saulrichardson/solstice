  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) across patient subgroups (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above) for PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. The figure provides comparative effectiveness data for vaccines in different clinical subgroups but does not present any information about mutations arising during vaccine production, so it does not support the claim. Note: The plot is clear in showing effectiveness measures but contains no mechanistic or production-related data. Confidence is limited by the absence of mutation or manufacturing context.",
