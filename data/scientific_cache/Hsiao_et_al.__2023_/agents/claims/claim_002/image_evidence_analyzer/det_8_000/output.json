Subgroups are defined by PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia, each stratified by conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above conditions). does not support the claim: the figure only presents comparative vaccine effectiveness data and does not include any information about mutations arising during cell- or egg-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness.",
