  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) for various subgroups (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, and any of the above) across three endpoints: PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. The x-axis displays percentage values from \u201350% to +55%. does not support the claim because the figure presents subgroup effectiveness data and does not address vaccine production methods or mutation development during egg- or cell-based manufacturing. Note: Limited by the absence of any mention of mutations or production processes in the figure; context of comparison (e.g., cell-based vs egg-based) is not specified explicitly in the image.",
