  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A table comparing outcomes (PCR-confirmed influenza and hospitalizations) per 1000 people between two vaccine groups (N=279,400 vs N=395,852), showing unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios, effectiveness percentages, and P values for primary and secondary outcomes. The table presents clinical effectiveness and rate ratios for two influenza vaccine groups but contains no data or statements about the development of mutations during egg- or cell-based vaccine production and thus does not support the claim Note: The table is focused on clinical outcomes and effectiveness; no mechanistic or production details on mutations are provided",
