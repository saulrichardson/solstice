  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing recombinant influenza vaccine (N=279,400) versus standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852) across primary and secondary clinical outcomes, showing number of cases per 1000, unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs, relative vaccine effectiveness percentages, and P values for outcomes such as PCR-confirmed influenza A and B, and various hospitalization endpoints. The table presents comparative clinical effectiveness data between recombinant and standard-dose vaccines and does not mention or provide any information on mutations arising during egg- or cell-based vaccine production; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible table content; no mention of production methods or mechanistic data on mutations is present.",
