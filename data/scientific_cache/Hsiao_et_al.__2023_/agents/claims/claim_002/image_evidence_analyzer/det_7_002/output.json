  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing outcomes (PCR-confirmed influenza, influenza A/B, hospitalizations) between recombinant vaccine (N=279,400) and standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852), showing cases per 1,000, unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CI, relative vaccine effectiveness percentages and P values. The table presents comparative effectiveness data between recombinant and standard-dose (egg-based) vaccines but contains no information about mutations arising during production in eggs or cell cultures; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Table does not mention production methods or mutation data; clarity of image sufficient for outcome measures only.",
