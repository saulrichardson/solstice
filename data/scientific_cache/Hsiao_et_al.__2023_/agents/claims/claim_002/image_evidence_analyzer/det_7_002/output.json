  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing outcomes for recombinant vaccine (N=279,400) versus standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852), showing number of cases per 1000 for PCR-confirmed influenza and various secondary outcomes, along with unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios, relative vaccine effectiveness percentages, and P values. The table presents comparative effectiveness data between recombinant and standard-dose (egg-based) vaccines but does not mention mutations during production or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim.",
