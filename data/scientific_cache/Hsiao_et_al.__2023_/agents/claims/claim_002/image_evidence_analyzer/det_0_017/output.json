  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image shows the title and authors of a clinical article titled \u201cRecombinant or Standard-Dose Influenza Vaccine in Adults under 65 Years of Age,\u201d followed by the beginning of the abstract. The visible text notes that recombinant influenza vaccines contain more hemagglutinin protein than standard-dose egg-based vaccines and states that recombinant vaccines \u201care not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.\u201d Evidence: The text explicitly mentions that egg-based vaccines are susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, but does not mention cell-based vaccines. The image only indicates that egg-based vaccines can undergo antigenic drift during production but provides no evidence regarding cell-based vaccine mutations, so it does not support the claim in full. Note: The abstract is partially visible and may omit additional context; no mention of cell-based vaccines is present in the visible portion.",
