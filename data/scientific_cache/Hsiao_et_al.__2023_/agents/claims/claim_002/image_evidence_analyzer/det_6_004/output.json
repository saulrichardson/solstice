  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants (sex, race/ethnicity, coexisting illnesses, prior influenza vaccination) in two vaccine groups (recombinant vs standard-dose) and overall. The table only presents participant demographics and clinical characteristics; it contains no information on vaccine production methods, mutation occurrence, or effects on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; table is cut off at the bottom but does not appear to address production mutations.",
