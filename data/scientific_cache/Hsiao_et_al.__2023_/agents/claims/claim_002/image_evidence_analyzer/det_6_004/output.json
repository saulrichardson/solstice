  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A table presenting the number and percentage of study participants stratified by age group (18\u201349 years, 50\u201364 years, and all participants) and by vaccine type (cell-based vaccine, egg-based vaccine, and all vaccines). The table lists demographic characteristics (sex, race or ethnic group), clinical conditions (asthma, diabetes, COPD, coronary heart disease), and history of influenza vaccination in the previous year. The table provides demographic and clinical characteristics of participants by vaccine type but contains no information about the development of mutations during vaccine production or any impact on vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim.",
