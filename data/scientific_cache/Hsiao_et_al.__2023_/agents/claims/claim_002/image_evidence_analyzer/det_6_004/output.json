  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing demographic and clinical characteristics of vaccine recipients divided into recombinant vaccine (N=279,400), standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852), and all vaccinees (N=675,252), including sex, race/ethnicity, Hispanic ethnicity, coexisting illnesses (asthma, diabetes, COPD, coronary heart disease), and receipt of influenza vaccine in the previous year. The table provides only demographic and clinical characteristics of participants and contains no information about vaccine production methods, mutations, or effectiveness, so it does not support the claim.",
