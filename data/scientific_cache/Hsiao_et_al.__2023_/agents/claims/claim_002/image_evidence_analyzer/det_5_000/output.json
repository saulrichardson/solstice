  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A flowchart detailing the selection and exclusion of participants aged 18\u201364 years vaccinated over three seasons, showing numbers receiving recombinant versus standard-dose influenza vaccines and the stepwise exclusions leading to final cohort sizes for each group. The figure only outlines participant flow and cohort assembly for recombinant and standard-dose vaccine recipients; it contains no information on cell- or egg-based production methods, mutation development, or vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim.",
