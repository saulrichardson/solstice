  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining the selection and exclusion of participants aged 18\u201364 years vaccinated over three flu seasons, showing numbers receiving recombinant versus standard-dose vaccines, reasons for exclusion at each step, and final cohort sizes by age group. does not support the claim because the figure only presents participant enrollment and exclusion criteria for recombinant and standard-dose influenza vaccines, without any data or statements about mutations arising during cell- or egg-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness",
