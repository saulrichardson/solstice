  "explanation": "Flowchart showing the selection and exclusion of participants aged 18\u201364 who received either a recombinant flu vaccine or a standard-dose vaccine over the 2018\u20132021 seasons. It details initial vaccination counts, exclusions for non\u2013KPNC membership, inpatient vaccinations, out-of-range dates, missing facility identifiers, inability to assign facility-specific scores, and final cohort sizes. The figure is a CONSORT-style flow diagram of cohort selection and does not address vaccine production methods, mutation potential during production, or effectiveness implications, and therefore does not support the claim.",
