  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the selection and exclusion of 2,776,278 vaccinated adults aged 18\u201364 over three influenza seasons (2018\u20132021), showing numbers who received recombinant vaccine versus standard-dose vaccine, sequential exclusion for non-KPNC membership, inpatient vaccinations, out-of-range vaccine dates, missing facility identifiers, inability to assign facility-specific propensity scores, and final cohort counts by age group. The figure presents participant flow and cohort selection criteria for recombinant versus standard-dose vaccines and does not present any data or statements regarding mutations arising during cell- or egg-based vaccine production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim.",
