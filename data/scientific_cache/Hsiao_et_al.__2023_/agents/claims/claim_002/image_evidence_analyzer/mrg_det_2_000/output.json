  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic figure showing how Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) service\u2010area facilities of various sizes were grouped into two blocks (A and B) for cluster randomization, and a table detailing weekly alternating assignments of two influenza vaccine formulations (SD\u2010IIV4 and RIV4) for nine facilities over four weeks. The figure depicts facility grouping and randomized weekly assignment of two vaccine formulations but contains no information on cell\u2010 or egg\u2010based vaccine production processes or mutation potential, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Image quality is sufficient to determine it illustrates study design and vaccine assignment only; there is no mention of production methods or mutations.",
