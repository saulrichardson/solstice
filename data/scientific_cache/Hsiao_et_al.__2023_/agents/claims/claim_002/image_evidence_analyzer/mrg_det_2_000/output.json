  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic figure illustrating the design of a cluster-randomized crossover trial across Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) facilities. Panel 1 shows service area with facilities of various sizes. Panel 2 shows similarly sized facilities paired and randomized to Block A or B. Panel 3 shows that facilities in each block alternated weekly between standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) over four weeks. The figure depicts trial design and vaccine assignment schedules comparing egg-based SD-IIV4 and recombinant RIV4 across facilities, but contains no information on cell-based vaccine production, mutations, or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image resolution sufficient to read labels; limitation is that focus is on trial design, not biologic mechanisms.",
