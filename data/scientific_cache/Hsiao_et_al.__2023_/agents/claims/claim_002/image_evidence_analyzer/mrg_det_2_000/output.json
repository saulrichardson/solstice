  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel schematic showing (1) a service area with variously sized facilities, (2) random assignment of similarly sized facilities into Block A or Block B, and (3) a table listing each facility's weekly alternating influenza vaccine formulation (SD-IIV4 vs. RIV4) over four weeks. The figure only illustrates randomization of facilities and their alternating use of two vaccine formulations; it includes no information on production-related mutations in cell- or egg-based flu vaccines or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and shows only study design and vaccine scheduling, with no mutation or effectiveness data.",
