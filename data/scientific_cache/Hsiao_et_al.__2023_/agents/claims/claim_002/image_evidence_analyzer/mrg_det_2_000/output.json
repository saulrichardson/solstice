  "explanation": "A diagram showing 9 healthcare facilities of varying sizes grouped into service areas, randomly assigned to Block A or Block B by similar size, and a table detailing a 4-week alternating schedule of two influenza vaccine formulations (SD-IIV4 vs RIV4) given to each facility by week. The figure illustrates facility size matching, randomization into blocks, and alternating administration of two vaccine formulations (standard-dose inactivated vs recombinant), but it does not address cell- or egg-based vaccine production, mutations during manufacturing, or any effects on vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim.",
