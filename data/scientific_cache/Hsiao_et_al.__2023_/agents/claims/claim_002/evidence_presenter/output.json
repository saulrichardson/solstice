      "quote": "BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that recombinant influenza vaccines are not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which is a process that can lead to mutations. By contrasting recombinant vaccines with egg-based vaccines, the quote implies that egg-based vaccines are susceptible to antigenic drift (i.e., mutations) during production. This directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."

      "quote": "The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the effectiveness of standard dose (egg-based) vaccines may be reduced ('attenuated') by antigenic drift (mutations) that occur during egg-based manufacturing, and contrasts this with recombinant vaccines, which are not susceptible to such drift. This directly addresses the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness."
