The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote highlights that egg-based vaccines use chicken eggs for manufacturing, which can lead to mutations, while recombinant vaccines avoid this by producing a protein that is genetically identical to the selected strain. This supports the claim that cell- and egg-based vaccines can develop mutations during production, potentially reducing effectiveness.",
