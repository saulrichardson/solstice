      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that standard dose egg-based vaccines are susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which can lead to mutations that may reduce vaccine effectiveness. It also contrasts this with recombinant vaccines, which are not susceptible to such drift, directly supporting the claim."

The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote highlights that egg-based vaccines use chicken eggs for manufacturing, which can lead to mutations, while recombinant vaccines avoid this by producing a genetically identical protein, directly supporting the claim about mutation risk in egg-based production.",
