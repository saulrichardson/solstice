      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that standard dose egg-based vaccines are susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which can lead to mutations that may reduce vaccine effectiveness. It also contrasts this with recombinant vaccines, which are not susceptible to such drift, directly supporting the claim."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly affirms that antigenic drift (mutations) can occur during egg-based vaccine manufacturing, potentially reducing the effectiveness of these vaccines, which supports the claim."
