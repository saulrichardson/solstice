      "explanation": "The quote directly states that the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which implies that standard dose egg-based vaccines are susceptible to such drift. Antigenic drift during manufacturing refers to the development of mutations that can reduce vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, the quote explicitly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

This matches the provided quote in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent'). The factual content and technical details are preserved.",

      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the effectiveness of standard dose (egg-based) vaccines may be reduced ('attenuated') by antigenic drift (mutations) that occur during egg-based manufacturing. It also contrasts this with recombinant vaccines, which are not susceptible to such drift. This directly affirms that mutations during production can reduce the effectiveness of egg-based (and by extension, cell-based if similar processes apply) flu vaccines, as the claim asserts.",
