      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the following form: 'BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' This matches the provided quote in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').. The quote explicitly states that recombinant influenza vaccines are 'not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' By contrasting this with standard dose egg-based vaccines, it implies that egg-based vaccines are susceptible to antigenic drift (which is caused by mutations during production). Since antigenic drift can reduce vaccine effectiveness, this statement directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 10 of the document: 'The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift.' This matches the provided quote in both meaning and technical content, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'H3N2' vs 'H3 N2').. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the effectiveness of standard dose (egg-based) vaccines may be reduced ('attenuated') by antigenic drift (mutations) that occur during egg-based manufacturing. It also contrasts this with recombinant vaccines, which are not susceptible to such drift. This directly addresses the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness.",
