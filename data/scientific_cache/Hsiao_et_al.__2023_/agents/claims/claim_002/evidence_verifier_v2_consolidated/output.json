      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that recombinant influenza vaccines are 'not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' Since the comparison is with 'standard dose egg based vaccines,' and the context is about manufacturing, this directly implies that egg-based vaccines are susceptible to antigenic drift (which is caused by mutations during production). Antigenic drift during manufacturing can reduce vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, the quote directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

This matches the provided quote in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent').",

      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the effectiveness of standard dose (egg-based) vaccines may be reduced ('attenuated') by antigenic drift (mutations) that occur during egg-based manufacturing. It also contrasts this with recombinant vaccines, which are not susceptible to such drift. This directly addresses the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness.",

The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'H3N2' vs 'H3 N2'). The factual content and meaning are preserved.",
