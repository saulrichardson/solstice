      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that recombinant influenza vaccines are not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which is a process that can lead to mutations. By contrasting recombinant vaccines with egg-based vaccines, the quote implies that egg-based vaccines are susceptible to antigenic drift (i.e., mutations) during production. This directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the effectiveness of standard dose (egg-based) vaccines may be reduced ('attenuated') by antigenic drift (mutations) that occur during egg-based manufacturing, and contrasts this with recombinant vaccines, which are not susceptible to such drift. This directly addresses the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness.",
