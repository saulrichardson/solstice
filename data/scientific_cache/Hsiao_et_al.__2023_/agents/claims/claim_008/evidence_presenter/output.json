      "quote": "BACKGROUND Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the 'BACKGROUND' section: 'Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing.' This matches the quoted text in both meaning and factual content.. The quote directly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines. Since the standard dose is known to be 15 mcg per strain, this supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg per strain (3 x 15 mcg = 45 mcg). The document does not explicitly state the microgram amounts, but the 'three times' statement is a direct factual basis for the claim."

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document on page 2: 'The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines. Since the standard dose is 15 mcg per strain (a widely accepted fact in influenza vaccine literature, but not directly stated in this document), the quote provides the necessary ratio (3x) to support the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg per strain versus 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose vaccines. The document does not state the microgram amounts directly, but the 3x relationship is sufficient to substantiate the claim as framed."

      "explanation": "Title and abstract of an article comparing recombinant and standard-dose influenza vaccines in adults under 65 years, including a sentence stating that trivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines. Evidence: \u201cTrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines.\u201d The statement that recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein compared to standard-dose vaccines supports the claim that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) delivers 45 mcg per strain versus 15 mcg per strain in a standard-dose vaccine. Note: The image does not explicitly name Flublok or specify the 45 mcg and 15 mcg values; it only provides the 3-fold relationship."
