Since the standard dose is known to be 15 mcg of HA per strain, this supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain (3 x 15 mcg = 45 mcg). The quote provides explicit comparative information about the HA content, which substantiates the claim.",

The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor differences in phrasing (e.g., 'egg based' vs. 'egg-based'), but the factual content is the same.",

While it does not provide the exact numbers (45 mcg vs 15 mcg), it directly supports the claim's core assertion about the relative HA content per strain.

However, it does not directly state the HA content per strain, so it is only weakly supportive."
