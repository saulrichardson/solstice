  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants (age, sex, race, ethnicity, comorbidities, prior influenza vaccination) across different vaccine groups, with counts and percentages. The table provides participant demographics and clinical characteristics but does not include any information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per vaccine strain, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible but contains no data on antigen dosage; limitation is that dosage information may be present elsewhere in the document.",
