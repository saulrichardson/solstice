  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-step flowchart showing the number of participants aged 18\u201364 vaccinated over three influenza seasons, divided into those who received a recombinant vaccine (left) and those who received a standard-dose vaccine (right). At each step, numbers excluded for reasons such as nonmembership, inpatient vaccination, vaccination outside the eligible date range, missing facility identifier, and inability to assign a facility-specific propensity score are shown, culminating in the final cohort sizes by age group. The figure does not mention hemagglutinin (HA) microgram amounts per strain for either Flublok or standard-dose vaccines and thus does not support the claim. Note: The flowchart is clear but contains no dosage or HA content information.",
