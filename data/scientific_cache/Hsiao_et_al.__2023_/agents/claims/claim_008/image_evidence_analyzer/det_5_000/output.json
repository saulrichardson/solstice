  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the selection and exclusion process for study participants aged 18\u201364 who received either a recombinant influenza vaccine or a standard-dose influenza vaccine across three seasons, with numbers at each step of exclusion and the final cohort sizes. The figure details participant enrollment and exclusions for recombinant versus standard-dose vaccines but contains no information about hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain, and thus does not support the claim. Note: None; the image's content is clear and fully legible, showing only cohort numbers and exclusion criteria without HA dosage information.",
