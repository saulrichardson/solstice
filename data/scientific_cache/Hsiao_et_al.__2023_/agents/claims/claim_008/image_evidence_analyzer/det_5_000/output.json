  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the selection and exclusion of study participants aged 18\u201364 who received either a recombinant influenza vaccine or a standard-dose influenza vaccine across three seasons (2018\u20132021). Boxes show the number of vaccinated individuals, exclusions for nonmembership, inpatient vaccinations, vaccination date range, missing facility identifiers, inability to assign propensity scores, and final cohort sizes. The figure is a participant flow diagram without any information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per vaccine strain, so it does not support the claim.",
