  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table showing primary and secondary clinical outcomes (e.g., PCR-confirmed influenza A and B, hospitalizations for PCR-confirmed influenza, community-acquired pneumonia, cardiorespiratory events) with case rates per 1000, unadjusted rate ratios, hazard ratios with 95% CIs, vaccine effectiveness percentages, and P values for two vaccine groups (Flublok and standard-dose). The table presents clinical outcome data comparing two vaccines but does not provide any information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain, and thus does not support the claim.",
