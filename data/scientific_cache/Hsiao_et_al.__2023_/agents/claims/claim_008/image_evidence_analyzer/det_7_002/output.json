  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing clinical outcomes between a recombinant influenza vaccine and a standard-dose influenza vaccine. Columns include number of cases per 1000, unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios, relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI), and P values for primary and secondary outcomes (e.g., PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalizations). does not support the claim because the table presents clinical outcome data and effectiveness comparisons without any information on hemagglutinin (HA) micrograms per strain in either vaccine Note: The table does not include any vaccine composition or dosage information; it focuses solely on effectiveness and safety outcomes.",
