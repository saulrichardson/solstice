  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing clinical outcomes for a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine, showing numbers of PCR-confirmed influenza cases and hospitalizations per 1000, unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios, relative vaccine effectiveness, and P values. The table presents effectiveness and outcome data for recombinant versus standard-dose influenza vaccines but does not report antigen content (HA micrograms per strain) for either vaccine, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear and legible; the lack of dosage information limits any inference about HA content.",
