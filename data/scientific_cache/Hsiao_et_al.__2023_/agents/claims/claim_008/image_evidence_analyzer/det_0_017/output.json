  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",

  "explanation": "Title and abstract of an article comparing recombinant and standard-dose influenza vaccines in adults under 65 years, including a sentence stating that trivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines. Evidence: \u201cTrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines.\u201d The statement that recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein compared to standard-dose vaccines supports the claim that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) delivers 45 mcg per strain versus 15 mcg per strain in a standard-dose vaccine. Note: The image does not explicitly name Flublok or specify the 45 mcg and 15 mcg values; it only provides the 3-fold relationship.",
