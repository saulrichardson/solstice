  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Forest plot illustrating relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) of two influenza vaccines across patient subgroups (e.g., cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, obesity, diabetes) for outcomes including PCR-confirmed influenza and hospitalizations. The figure presents comparative effectiveness percentages and confidence intervals by subgroup and does not include any information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain, so it does not support the claim Note: The image is sufficiently clear to determine that no antigen content information is provided",
