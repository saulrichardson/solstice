  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Forest plot of relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% CI) across multiple subgroups (e.g., cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, obesity, diabetes) for outcomes including PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. The image shows relative vaccine effectiveness data across clinical subgroups but contains no information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain; therefore it does not support the claim Note: Limited to the displayed forest plot; no mention of antigen dosage or HA content",
