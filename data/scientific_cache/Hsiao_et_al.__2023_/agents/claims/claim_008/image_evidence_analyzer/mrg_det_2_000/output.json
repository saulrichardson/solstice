  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic flow diagram showing how nine KPNC facilities of various sizes were grouped into service areas, randomized into Block A or Block B, and then a table illustrating a 4-week alternating schedule of two vaccine formulations (SD-IIV4 and RIV4) at each facility. does not support the claim because the figure solely depicts site randomization and weekly vaccine formulation assignments without providing any information on hemagglutinin microgram content per strain for either SD-IIV4 or RIV4. Note: The figure does not include any dosage or antigen content details; information on micrograms of HA per strain is not present.",
