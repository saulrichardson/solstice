  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Figure showing study cluster randomization by service area and facility size, with facilities grouped into Block A and Block B and a table of weekly alternation between SD-IIV4 and RIV4 vaccines over four weeks. The image only presents the cluster randomization design and weekly assignment of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4; it contains no information on HA microgram content per strain and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clear but does not include dosing information; no limitations in interpreting absence of dosage data.",
