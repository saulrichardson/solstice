  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image shows a schematic of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) service area facilities of various sizes grouped into Blocks A and B, along with a table illustrating a 4-week schedule in which facilities alternate between SD-IIV4 (standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine, quadrivalent) and RIV4 (recombinant influenza vaccine, quadrivalent). does not support the claim because the figure only depicts facility randomization and vaccine administration schedules; it contains no information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain for Flublok or standard-dose vaccines.",
