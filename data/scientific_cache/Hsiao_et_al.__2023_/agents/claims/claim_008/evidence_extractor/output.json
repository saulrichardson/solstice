      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that the recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok) contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein compared to standard dose vaccines. Since the standard dose is 15 micrograms (mcg) per strain, this directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg per strain."

      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. The vaccine also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines, an increased level that has been correlated with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote confirms that Flublok contains three times the hemagglutinin protein of standard dose vaccines, which, given the standard dose is 15 mcg per strain, means Flublok contains 45 mcg per strain, directly supporting the claim."
