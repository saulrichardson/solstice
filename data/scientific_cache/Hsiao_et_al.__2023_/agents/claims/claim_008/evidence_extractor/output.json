      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that the recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok) contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein compared to standard dose vaccines. Since the standard dose is 15 micrograms (mcg) per strain, this directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg per strain."
