      "explanation": "The quote directly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines. Since the standard dose is known to be 15 mcg per strain, this supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg per strain (3 x 15 mcg = 45 mcg). The document does not explicitly state the microgram amounts, but the 'three times' statement is a direct factual basis for the claim.",

This matches the quoted text in both meaning and factual content, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'egg based' vs 'egg-based').",
