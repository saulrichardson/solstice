This matches the quoted text in both meaning and factual content.. The quote directly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (such as Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg-based vaccines. Since the standard dose is known to be 15 mcg per strain, this supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg per strain (3 x 15 mcg = 45 mcg). The document does not explicitly state the microgram amounts, but the 'three times' statement is a direct factual basis for the claim.",

The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose vaccines. Since the standard dose is 15 mcg per strain (a widely accepted fact in influenza vaccine literature, but not directly stated in this document), the quote provides the necessary ratio (3x) to support the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg per strain versus 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose vaccines. The document does not state the microgram amounts directly, but the 3x relationship is sufficient to substantiate the claim as framed.",
