      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok's hemagglutinin protein is 'genetically identical to that in the selected strain.' Since the selected strain refers to the strains chosen by health authorities (such as WHO and FDA) for vaccine composition, this statement explicitly supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with those selected strains. No inference is required; the support is direct and explicit.",

This matches the provided quote in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, spacing, and the word 'Sanofi' being split by a line break in the OCR). The factual content is preserved.",
