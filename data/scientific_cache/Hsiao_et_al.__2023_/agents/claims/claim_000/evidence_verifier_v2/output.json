This matches the provided quote in both content and meaning, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly states that the hemagglutinin protein in Flublok is 'genetically identical to that in the selected strain.' Since the selected strain refers to the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains for the season, this supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with those strains. The quote is explicit and does not require inference.",
