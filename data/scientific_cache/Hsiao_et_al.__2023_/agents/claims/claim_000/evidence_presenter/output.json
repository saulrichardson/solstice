      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok's hemagglutinin protein is 'genetically identical to that in the selected strain.' Since the selected strain refers to the strains chosen by health authorities (such as WHO and FDA) for vaccine composition, this statement explicitly supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with those selected strains. No inference is required; the support is direct and explicit."
