      "quote": "The Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Sanofi) is manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical to that in the selected strain.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok's hemagglutinin protein is genetically identical to that in the selected strain. Since the selected strain refers to the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains for the season, this statement explicitly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with those strains. No inference is required; the document makes this connection clear."
