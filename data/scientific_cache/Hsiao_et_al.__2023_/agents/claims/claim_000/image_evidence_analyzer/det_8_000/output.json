  "explanation": "A forest plot titled 'Subgroup Analysis of Relative Vaccine Effectiveness (95% CI)' showing point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the relative effectiveness of a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine among participants aged 50 to 64 years, stratified by preexisting conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above) for three outcomes: PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. The figure presents relative effectiveness data but contains no information on antigenic composition or match to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No direct antigenic match data are provided in this image.",
