  "explanation": "A forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI) percentages for Flublok vs comparator across subgroups (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above) and outcomes (PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia). The figure presents subgroup clinical effectiveness data and contains no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim.",
