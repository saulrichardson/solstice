This page contains only the article title, author list, and introductory abstract text; it does not provide any information about Flublok\u2019s antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected strains and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited to the visible title and abstract excerpt; no data on antigenic match is shown",
