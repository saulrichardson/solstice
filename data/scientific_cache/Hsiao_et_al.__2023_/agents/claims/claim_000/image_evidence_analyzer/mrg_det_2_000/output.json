  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Schematic diagram showing: 1) A KPNC service area with nine facilities of various sizes; 2) Random assignment of similarly sized facilities into Block A or Block B; 3) A table listing weekly alternation of two influenza vaccine formulations (SD-IIV4 and RIV4) across facilities for the first four weeks of the season. The figure illustrates the design of facility-level randomization and weekly alternation between standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4). It contains no information about Flublok or its antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Figure is clear but unrelated to antigenic matching or Flublok; confidence in this assessment is high.",
