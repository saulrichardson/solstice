  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure illustrating (1) KPNC service area facilities of various sizes represented as boxes, (2) random assignment of similarly sized facilities into Block A or Block B groups, and (3) a table showing a 4-week alternating vaccination schedule between SD-IIV4 and RIV4 for each facility. The figure depicts site grouping and randomization procedures and weekly SD-IIV4 vs RIV4 administration schedules. It does not address Flublok or its antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected strains and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The figure focuses solely on trial design and vaccine scheduling; there are no data or statements regarding antigenic matching or Flublok.",
