  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

  "explanation": "Three\u2010panel schematic showing (1) layout of nine KPNC facilities of various sizes in a service area, (2) random assignment of similarly sized facilities into Block A or Block B, and (3) a table of four weeks of alternating vaccine formulations (SD-IIV4 vs RIV4) by facility block. The figure only illustrates how KPNC facilities were grouped and alternated between standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) on a weekly schedule. It contains no information about antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and focused on randomization and scheduling; no antigen composition or matching data are shown.",
