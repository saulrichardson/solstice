  "explanation": "A schematic of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California service area facilities of various sizes, grouped into two blocks (A and B) of similarly sized facilities, and a table showing weekly alternating assignment of two vaccine formulations (SD-IIV4 and RIV4) to each facility over a 4-week schedule. The figure describes cluster randomization of facilities to receive either standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) or recombinant quadrivalent vaccine (RIV4) on a weekly alternating basis; it does not present any information on Flublok antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains and therefore does not support the claim.",
