  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

  "explanation": "A comparative table showing number of cases per 1000 for recombinant vaccine (N=279,400) versus standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852) across primary and secondary outcomes (PCR-confirmed influenza A and B, hospitalizations for influenza or related conditions), along with unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI), relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI), and P values. The table presents clinical effectiveness outcomes and statistical comparisons between a recombinant vaccine and a standard-dose vaccine, without any data or statements regarding antigenic composition or matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and therefore does not support the claim.",
