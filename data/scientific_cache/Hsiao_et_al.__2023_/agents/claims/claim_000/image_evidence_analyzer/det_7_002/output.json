  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A comparative table showing outcomes for recombinant vaccine (N=279,400) versus standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852), including number of PCR-confirmed influenza cases per 1000, unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios, relative vaccine effectiveness percentages with 95% CIs, and P values for primary and secondary outcomes (influenza A, influenza B, hospitalizations). The table reports vaccine effectiveness and clinical outcome data but contains no information on antigenic matching or references to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and therefore does not support the claim.",
