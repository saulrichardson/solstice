  "explanation": "A flow diagram illustrating the selection and exclusion of study participants aged 18\u201364 years vaccinated between 2018 and 2021, showing numbers who received recombinant versus standard-dose influenza vaccines and stepwise exclusions (non-members, inpatient vaccinations, out-of-range dates, missing facility data, unassignable propensity scores) leading to final cohort counts and age breakdowns. does not support the claim because the figure only details participant inclusion and exclusion criteria and provides no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains. Note: Figure clearly shows only study population flow; no strain or antigenic match data are present.",
