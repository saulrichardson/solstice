  "explanation": "A flow diagram showing selection and exclusion of participants aged 18\u201364 vaccinated over three flu seasons, splitting into recombinant vaccine (Flublok) and standard-dose vaccine arms, with successive exclusion criteria and final cohort sizes. The figure is a participant flowchart and contains no information on antigenic matching with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: No relevant antigenic or strain-match data are present in the image.",
