  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The figure illustrates a three\u2010step schematic and table related to a clinical study design at KPNC facilities: (1) a diagram of nine facilities of various sizes within a service area; (2) assignment of similarly sized facilities to Block A or Block B; (3) a table showing a sample 4\u2010week schedule of alternating vaccine formulations (SD\u2010IIV4 vs RIV4) at each facility by block. The image describes facility block assignment and weekly alternation of standard-dose IIV4 (SD-IIV4) and recombinant IIV4 (RIV4) vaccines, but it contains no information about Flublok\u2019s production platform, recombinant HA expression in insect cells, or the baculovirus expression vector system. Therefore, it does not support the claim.",
