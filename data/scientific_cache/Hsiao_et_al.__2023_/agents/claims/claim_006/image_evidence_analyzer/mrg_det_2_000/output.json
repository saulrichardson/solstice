  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Schematic diagrams and a table showing KPNC service areas with facilities of various sizes, random assignment of similarly sized facilities into Block A or Block B, and a 4-week alternating schedule of SD-IIV4 and RIV4 across nine facilities. The figure focuses exclusively on site stratification, block randomization, and vaccine scheduling (SD-IIV4 vs. RIV4) but does not describe vaccine production methods, insect cell expression, or use of a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim.",
