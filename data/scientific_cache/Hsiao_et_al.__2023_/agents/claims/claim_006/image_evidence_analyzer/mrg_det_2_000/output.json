  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image contains a schematic of Kaiser Permanente Northern California service-area facilities grouped into similarly sized Blocks A and B for a cluster-randomized trial, and a table listing Week 1\u20134 alternating vaccine assignments (SD-IIV4 vs RIV4) for each facility, with a footnote defining RIV4 as quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine and SD-IIV4 as quadrivalent standard inactivated influenza vaccine. does not support the claim: the figure only shows randomization of facilities and defines RIV4 as a recombinant influenza vaccine, but provides no information on the production platform, insect cells, or baculovirus expression vector system for Flublok. Note: The image focuses on study design and vaccine assignment; manufacturing details are not depicted.",
