  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A forest plot showing subgroup analyses of relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) of a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine among participants aged 50\u201364, stratified by preexisting conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any condition) for outcomes including PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. The image presents effectiveness data for a recombinant influenza vaccine compared to a standard-dose vaccine but does not mention Flublok\u2019s production platform, insect cells, or a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim.",
