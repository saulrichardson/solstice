  "explanation": "A flowchart diagram showing the number of participants aged 18\u201364 vaccinated across three seasons, divided into those who received a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine, with successive exclusions (non-members, inpatient vaccinations, out-of-range dates, missing identifiers, unassigned propensity scores) leading to final cohort sizes by age group. The figure presents cohort selection and participant counts for recombinant versus standard-dose influenza vaccines but contains no information on Flublok\u2019s production platform, expression system, or use of insect cells and BEVS, and therefore does not support the claim.",
