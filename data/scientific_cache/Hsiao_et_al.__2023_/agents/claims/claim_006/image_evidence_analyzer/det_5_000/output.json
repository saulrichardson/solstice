  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the selection and exclusion of study participants aged 18\u201364 years who received either a recombinant influenza vaccine or a standard-dose vaccine over three influenza seasons (2018\u20132021), with numbers at each exclusion step (nonmembers, inpatient vaccinations, out-of-range dates, missing facility identifiers, unassignable propensity scores) leading to final cohort sizes. The figure shows participant flow and cohort selection for recombinant versus standard-dose influenza vaccines and does not mention Flublok production methods or the use of insect cells or baculovirus expression vector systems, therefore it does not support the claim.",
