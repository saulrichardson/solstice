  "explanation": "A table listing clinical outcomes comparing a recombinant influenza vaccine (N=279,400) versus a standard-dose vaccine (N=395,852). Outcomes include PCR-confirmed influenza (overall, A and B), hospitalizations for PCR-confirmed influenza, community-acquired pneumonia, and cardiorespiratory events, with columns for cases per 1,000, unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI), relative vaccine effectiveness (95% CI), and P values. The table presents clinical effectiveness and safety outcomes of a recombinant vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine but contains no information on manufacturing methods or production platforms and therefore does not support the claim.",
