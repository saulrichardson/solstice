  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing clinical outcomes (PCR-confirmed influenza A and B, hospitalizations, etc.) per 1,000 persons between a recombinant influenza vaccine cohort (N=279,400) and a standard-dose vaccine cohort (N=395,852), showing unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios, relative vaccine effectiveness percentages with 95% CIs, and p values. The table provides comparative effectiveness data for a recombinant influenza vaccine versus a standard-dose vaccine but contains no information on how the recombinant vaccine is produced. It doesn't support the claim regarding the novel baculovirus expression vector system in insect cells. Note: Analysis is limited to the visible table content; no production method details are present.",
