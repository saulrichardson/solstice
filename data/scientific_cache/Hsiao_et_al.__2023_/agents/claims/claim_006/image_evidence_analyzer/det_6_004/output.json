  "explanation": "A table listing demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants (age, sex, race/ethnicity, preexisting conditions, prior influenza vaccination) stratified by vaccine group (recombinant vaccine, standard-dose vaccine, all vaccines). The table presents participant demographics and clinical characteristics and does not support the claim about Flublok\u2019s production platform.
