  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) for different clinical subgroups (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, any of the above) across three outcomes: PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. The figure presents clinical vaccine effectiveness percentages across patient subgroups and does not show any data on antibody responses, HA antigen production methods, or comparisons of broadly cross-reactive antibodies induced by BEVS-derived versus egg-derived vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear but does not include immunogenicity or antibody data; conclusions limited to clinical effectiveness outcomes.",
