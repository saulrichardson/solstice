  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A forest plot showing subgroup analyses of relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) of a recombinant influenza vaccine compared with a standard-dose egg-derived vaccine, across various preexisting conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, and any of the above) for PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia in participants aged 50\u201364 years. The image presents clinical effectiveness outcomes (relative vaccine effectiveness) by subgroup, not immunogenicity data on broadly cross-reactive antibody levels against conserved HA regions; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Figure content is clear but limited to clinical endpoints and does not report antibody responses or cross-reactivity measures.",
