  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Forest plot showing relative vaccine effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) of recombinant influenza vaccine versus egg-based vaccines across subgroups: PCR-confirmed influenza, hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia, each stratified by comorbid conditions (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, and any of the above). The x-axis shows percentage relative effectiveness from \u201350% to +55%. does not support the claim: the figure presents clinical relative vaccine effectiveness data across patient subgroups, but does not provide any immunogenicity measurements or data on broadly cross-reactive antibody levels against conserved HA regions induced by recombinant versus egg-derived vaccines.",
