  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",

  "explanation": "Flow diagram showing the Kaiser Permanente Northern California service area facilities of various sizes, randomly assigned into Block A or Block B clusters, and a table listing weekly alternation of vaccine formulations (SD-IIV4 vs RIV4) for each facility over four weeks. The figure depicts the cluster randomization design and vaccination schedule across facilities, but it does not present any immunogenicity or antibody response data. Therefore, it does not support the claim.",
