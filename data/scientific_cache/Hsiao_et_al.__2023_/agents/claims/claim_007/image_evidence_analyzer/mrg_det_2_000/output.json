  "page_number": 3,
  "block_id": "mrg_det_2_000",
  "claim_id": "claim_007",
  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The figure presents a schematic of KPNC service area facilities of various sizes, the process of randomly assigning similarly sized facilities into two blocks (Block A and Block B), and a table showing the weekly alternation of two influenza vaccine formulations (SD-IIV4 and RIV4) over four weeks at each facility. The figure only illustrates the randomization and scheduling of egg-derived (SD-IIV4) versus recombinant (RIV4) vaccine administration across facilities. It does not present any immunogenicity data or antibody measurements, and therefore does not support the claim about higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies induced by BEVS-produced HA antigens. Note: The image quality is sufficient to confirm that no immunologic or antibody titer data are shown; the figure is purely methodological.",
