  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic figure illustrating a cluster-randomized study design across nine facilities in a Northern California service area. Panel 1 shows the distribution of facilities of varying sizes. Panel 2 shows facilities paired by size into Block A and Block B via random assignment. Panel 3 is a table listing each facility\u2019s block assignment and the weekly alternating use of standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) versus recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) over four weeks. does not support the claim because the figure only depicts study design and vaccine administration schedules; it provides no data on antibody responses or comparative immunogenicity of BEVS-derived recombinant HA antigens versus egg-derived vaccines.",
