  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, coexisting illnesses, prior influenza vaccination) of participants receiving a recombinant vaccine versus a standard-dose (egg-derived) vaccine. does not support the claim because the table only presents participant demographics and clinical characteristics; it contains no data on antibody levels, cross-reactivity, or conserved HA region immunogenicity comparing BEVS-derived versus egg-derived vaccines. Note: The table is clear and complete for baseline characteristics but does not report any immunogenicity or antibody response data.",
