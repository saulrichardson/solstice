  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A clinical outcomes table comparing recombinant influenza vaccine versus standard-dose (egg-derived) vaccine: number of PCR-confirmed influenza cases per 1000, unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios, relative vaccine effectiveness percentages, and P values for primary and secondary outcomes. The table reports clinical effectiveness outcomes (case counts, hazard ratios, relative effectiveness) but contains no data on antibody levels, breadth of cross-reactivity, or responses to conserved HA regions. It therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to the visible clinical outcomes; no immunogenicity or serological data are shown.",
