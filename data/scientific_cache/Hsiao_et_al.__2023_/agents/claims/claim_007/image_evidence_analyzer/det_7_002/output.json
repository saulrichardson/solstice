  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A comparative table of clinical outcomes in recipients of recombinant influenza vaccine versus standard-dose (egg-derived) vaccine, showing number of cases per 1000, unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios, relative vaccine effectiveness percentages, and P values for PCR-confirmed influenza (overall, A and B) and hospitalizations for influenza, pneumonia, and cardiorespiratory events. The table presents clinical effectiveness data (case rates, hazard ratios, relative effectiveness) but contains no immunologic measurements of antibody levels or specificity to conserved HA regions. Therefore, it does not support the claim about broadly cross-reactive antibodies induced by BEVS-derived HA. Note: Table quality is clear; however, it addresses clinical outcomes not serologic or mechanistic antibody responses.",
