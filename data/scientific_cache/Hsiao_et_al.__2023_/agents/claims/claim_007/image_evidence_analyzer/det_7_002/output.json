  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A comparative table of primary and secondary clinical outcomes (e.g., PCR-confirmed influenza A and B cases, hospitalizations for influenza, pneumonia, cardiorespiratory events) between two vaccine groups, showing number of cases per 1000, unadjusted rate ratios, adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs, vaccine effectiveness percentages, and P values. The table presents clinical effectiveness outcomes (infection rates and hospitalizations) and does not include any immunogenicity data on antibody levels, cross-reactivity, or HA regions, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for clinical outcomes but contains no information on antibody responses; no additional relevant data are visible.",
