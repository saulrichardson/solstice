  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A flow diagram outlining the selection and exclusion of study participants aged 18\u201364 years who received either a recombinant influenza vaccine or a standard-dose (egg-derived) vaccine during the 2018\u20132021 seasons, showing numbers at each stage of exclusion and the final cohort sizes. does not support the claim because the figure only presents cohort selection and vaccine counts, without any data on levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies or comparisons between BEVS-produced and egg-derived HA antigens.
