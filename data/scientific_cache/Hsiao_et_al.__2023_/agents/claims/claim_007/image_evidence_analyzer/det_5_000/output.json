  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flow diagram detailing the selection of study participants aged 18\u201364 years vaccinated in the 2018\u20132019, 2019\u20132020, and 2020\u20132021 seasons, showing counts receiving recombinant vaccine versus standard\u2010dose vaccine, successive exclusion criteria, and final cohort sizes by age group. does not support the claim because the figure only presents participant flow and vaccine administration counts, with no immunogenicity or antibody response data comparing egg-derived and BEVS-produced recombinant antigens. Note: The image lacks any data on antibody levels or cross-reactivity; it only shows cohort selection and enrollment numbers.",
