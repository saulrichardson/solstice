METHODS In this cluster randomized observational study, Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities routinely administered either a high dose recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quad rival ent or one of two standard dose influenza vaccines during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 influenza seasons to adults 50 to 64 years of age (primary age group) and 18 to 49 years of age. Each facility alternated weekly between the two vaccine formulations. The primary outcome was influenza (A or B) confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Secondary outcomes included influenza A, influenza B, and influenza related hospitalization outcomes. We used Cox regression analysis to estimate the hazard ratio of the recombinant vaccine as compared with the standard dose vaccines against each outcome We calculated the relative vaccine effectiveness as 1 minus the hazard

BACKGROUND Quad rival ent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard dose egg based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. Data are needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines against influenza related outcomes in adults under the age ABSTR ACT g Amber Hsiao, Ph.

Most of the participants had been vaccinated before the beginning of the influenza season and were included in every risk set throughout the season. The Cox model also used stabilized weights that were based on propensity scores. The statistical analysis plan pre specified the use of propensity scores if imbalances were found in any study variables. We observed modest imbalances at some facilities in one or both seasons, although not overall (Tables S4 and S5). Thus, we created propensity scores that were specific for each facility and season. The propensity scores were

On the basis of previous data, we estimated the occurrence of 2.18 PCR-confirmed influenza cases per 1000 participants in the standard dose group. We used Cox regression analysis to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals for the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine for each outcome. The model specified a calendar time scale and included adjustments for sex, race or ethnic group, and age and an age squared factor (in case age and risk had either a linear or curvilinear association). Risk sets were formed on each date on which at least one outcome event occurred in either study group Each risk set

Statistical Analysis We tested the null hypotheses that the recombinant vaccine would not be any more or any less effective than a standard dose vaccine against influenza, using a two sided test with a P value of less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance. We estimated that the administration of 400 000 doses each of the two vaccine formulations to patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years each influenza season would provide the

For the primary objective, the relative vaccine effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine as compared with standard dose vaccines against all PCR-confirmed influenza was 15.3% (95% CI, 5.9 to 23.8; P = 0 002. The estimate of relative vaccine effectiveness for the secondary objective of PCR-confirmed

Conversely, a finding of no association between receipt of the recombinant vaccine and RSV infection would be reassuring that our estimates of relative vaccine effectiveness were not biased by unmeasured factors that might affect the risk of both laboratory confirmed RSV infection and influenza. All data analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

tic i pants at baseline were similar in the two vaccine groups and in the two age groups (Table 1 and Table S6). There was some variation in the timing of the administration of the two vaccines according to geographic region, although during the two influenza seasons, most vaccinations in the two groups had occurred by mid to late November (Tables S4 and S5).

For secondary objectives in participants between the ages of 50 and 64 years, we adjusted for multiplicity by Holm’smethod.10 Subgroup analyses involving participants with preexisting conditions were not adjusted for multiplicity. We conducted sensitivity analyses in which we used propensity scores in alternative ways, used a robust variance estimator, stratified risk sets according to facility and vaccination week, and specified age as a spline (see the Supplementary Methods section). To assess possible residual confounding, we examined PCR-confirmed RSV infection as a negative control outcome because we would not expect influenza vaccination to be associated with a reduction in this infection.

A strength of our study is that the two study vaccine formulations were alternated in weekly intervals of time at each facility, which allowed us to balance covariates of interest as designed. In every KPNC geographic area, when influenza arrived, there were already participants who had received one of the two formulations of vaccine and who were similar with respect to demo-

Several studies have shown benefit for the recombinant vaccine and other high dose influenza vaccines as compared with standard dose vaccines in adults who are 65 years of age or older, findings that have been attributed to an improved immune response 5 14 17 In the current study, we compared the effectiveness of the high dose recombinant vaccine with that of standard dose vaccines in patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years. The effectiveness of standard dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3 N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg based manufacturing, whereas the recombinant vaccine is not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3 N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season 18 and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard dose vaccines 19 20 During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3 N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overll i d i h ihi h d f h l

However, since standard dose vaccines prevent at most 40 to 60% of influenza cases annually 13 reducing the incidence of breakthrough influenza by 15% would provide asub-

Supported by San of i. Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. We thank many groups within Kaiser Permanente Northern California for their dedication and contributions to this study, including the members of the KPNC Seasonal Flu Program, the clinical teams who managed and administered influenza vaccines, the pharmacy teams, and the KPNC regional laboratory, without whose support this study would not have been possible; and Ruvim Izikson of San of i for scientific discussions and coordination.

in our real world setting, compliance with the weekly assigned vaccine schedule occasionally varied because of logistic con strains ts, including supply chain issues for the recombinant vaccine, which led to different numbers of participants in the two groups. Second, our data were limited to two influenza seasons; relative vaccine effectiveness may vary across seasons, depending on the vaccine match with circulating strains. Third, our primary outcome did not include infections in persons who did not undergo PCR testing, which limits its genera liz ability. Fourth, the study had limited power to detect a clinically meaningful benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard dose vaccine with respect to less frequent outcomes, such as hospitalization for PCR-confirmed influenza. Finally, although KPNC has a diverse population, it may not be representative of other populations in the United States. In this study performed during two influenza ...50 d
