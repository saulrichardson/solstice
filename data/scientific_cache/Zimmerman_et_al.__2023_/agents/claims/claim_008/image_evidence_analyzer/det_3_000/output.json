  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flowchart depicting study cohort selection and categorization: initial cohort of 18,467 adults, exclusions (3,264), resulting in an analyzable cohort of 15,203, split into controls (13,385) and influenza cases (1,868), each further subdivided by vaccine type (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4+Adj-IV) and unvaccinated. The figure does not support the claim as it contains no information on HA microgram content per strain for Flublok or standard-dose influenza vaccines. Note: Image quality is sufficient; content is clearly unrelated to HA dosage specifications.",
