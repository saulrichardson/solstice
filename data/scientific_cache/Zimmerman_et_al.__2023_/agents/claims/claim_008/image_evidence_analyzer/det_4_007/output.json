  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing baseline participant characteristics (race, sex, influenza season distribution, influenza case status, high-risk condition) for different vaccine groups (RIV4 vs SD-IIV4 in 18\u201364 and \u226565 age cohorts) The table presents demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants by vaccine type and age group, with no information on HA microgram content per strain; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear but contains no vaccine composition details such as HA dosage, so content-based conclusions cannot be drawn.",
