  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing demographic and clinical characteristics (race, sex, season, influenza case status, high-risk condition) of study participants by age group (18\u201364 and \u226565 years) and vaccine received (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4, Adj-IV), with counts, percentages, and P-values. The table presents participant demographics and vaccine distribution; it does not report hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for the table shown; no information on HA dosage is present.",
