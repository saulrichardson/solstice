  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine effectiveness (VE) percentages (with 95% confidence intervals) for different influenza vaccines (recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine RIV4, standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine SD-IIV4, RIV4 combined with high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine HD-IIV4 and adjuvanted influenza vaccine Adj-IV), stratified by age groups (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years). The table contains only VE data and does not include any information on hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image only shows vaccine effectiveness metrics; no antigen dosage details are present.",
