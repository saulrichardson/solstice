  "explanation": "Partial table footnotes and accompanying text from a clinical document defining vaccine abbreviations (e.g., RIV4: Flublok; SD-IIV4: Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, Standard Dose Fluzone and FluCelvax) and discussing vaccine effectiveness outcomes The image does not support the claim because it contains only vaccine names, abbreviations, and effectiveness data but provides no information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain for Flublok or standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim Note: Image is partial and focused on vaccine effectiveness and footnotes; HA dosage information, if present elsewhere, is not visible here",
