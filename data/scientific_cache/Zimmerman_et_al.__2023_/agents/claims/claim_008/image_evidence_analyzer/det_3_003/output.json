  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing demographic and clinical characteristics (race, sex, season, age group, influenza case status, high-risk condition) of study participants who received RIV4 versus standard-dose IIV4, including counts, percentages, and P-values. The table provides participant demographics and outcomes but contains no information on HA content per strain for Flublok or standard-dose influenza vaccines, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but does not address vaccine antigen content; confidence in the assessment is high.",
