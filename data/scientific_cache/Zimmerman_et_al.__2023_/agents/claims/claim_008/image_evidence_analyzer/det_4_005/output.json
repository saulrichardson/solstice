  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE, %) with 95% confidence intervals for different age groups (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years) and subgroups (overall, by sex, risk condition, season) comparing RIV4 and SD-IIV4 (and in \u226565 also HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV). The table only reports vaccine effectiveness percentages and confidence intervals for various groups and seasons; it does not provide any information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain. Therefore, it does not support the claim about Flublok containing 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg in standard-dose vaccine. Note: The image is clear but contains only VE data, with no formulation or dosage details.",
