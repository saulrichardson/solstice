  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial screenshot of two columns of text from page 5138 of a clinical document, discussing vaccine effectiveness against RT-PCR confirmed ILI and retrospective cohort studies. No table is visible showing HA content per strain. The image does not support the claim because it does not show any data on HA microgram content per strain for Flublok or standard-dose influenza vaccines, and contains only text about vaccine effectiveness and study results, so it does not support the claim. Note: The provided image is a text excerpt without any table or dosage information; it\u2019s not possible to verify HA content from this snippet.",
