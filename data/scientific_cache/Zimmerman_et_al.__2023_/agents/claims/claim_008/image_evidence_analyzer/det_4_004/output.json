  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table reporting relative vaccine effectiveness estimates comparing RIV4 (Flublok) versus SD-IIV4 (standard\u2010dose inactivated influenza vaccines) overall and by subgroups, with point estimates and confidence intervals, plus footnotes defining RIV4 and SD-IIV4 and describing the statistical models used. The table presents comparative effectiveness data and definitions of vaccine acronyms but contains no information on hemagglutinin microgram content per strain, so it doesn't support the claim. Note: Table is clear but focused on effectiveness, not formulation details; no dosage information is visible.",
