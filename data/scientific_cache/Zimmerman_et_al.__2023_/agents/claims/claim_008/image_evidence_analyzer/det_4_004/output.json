  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates for RIV4 (Flublok) compared to no vaccination, adjusted VE estimates for standard-dose IIV4 (SD-IIV4) compared to no vaccination, and relative VE of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 across subgroups (overall, by sex, age, risk condition, and season). does not support the claim because the table presents vaccine effectiveness data and does not report antigen (HA) microgram amounts per strain for Flublok or standard-dose influenza vaccine Note: The table is clear but does not include any antigen content information; assessment limited to visible content.",
