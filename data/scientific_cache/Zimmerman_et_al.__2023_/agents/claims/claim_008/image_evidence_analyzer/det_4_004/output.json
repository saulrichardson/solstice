  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table reporting adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) compared to no vaccination and to standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), stratified by demographic subgroups and seasons, with VE expressed as percentages and 95% confidence intervals. The table provides effectiveness data and confidence intervals but contains no information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain for either Flublok or standard-dose vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and legible; absence of HA dose information is definitive in this context.",
