  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the primary analysis populations in a clinical study: participants receiving recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, n=3,047 initially then n=291 in analysis), standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4, n=862 initially then n=114 in analysis), and unvaccinated participants (n=8,878 initially then n=1,398 in analysis). The figure only shows participant numbers and group assignments for RIV4, SD-IIV4, and unvaccinated cohorts; it does not provide any information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain, so it does not support the claim",
