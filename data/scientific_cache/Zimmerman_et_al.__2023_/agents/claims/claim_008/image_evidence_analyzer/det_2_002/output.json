  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flow diagram showing the derivation of the analyzable cohort (N=14,590) from the initial study population (N=18,467), exclusions, and subsequent division into controls and influenza cases with group counts for RIV4, SD-IIV4, and unvaccinated subjects. The figure is solely a participant flowchart with group sizes and does not present any information on hemagglutinin antigen content per vaccine strain, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible; no HA dosage data are shown.",
