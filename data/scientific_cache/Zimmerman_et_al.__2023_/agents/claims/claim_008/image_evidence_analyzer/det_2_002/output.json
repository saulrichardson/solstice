  "explanation": "Flowchart depicting cohort selection and distribution of study participants aged 18 years and older (N=18,467), exclusions leading to an analyzable cohort (N=14,590), then splitting into controls (N=12,837) and influenza cases (N=1,803), and further into vaccine groups: RIV4, SD-IIV4, and unvaccinated with respective counts. The figure only outlines participant flow and group sizes for RIV4, SD-IIV4, and unvaccinated cohorts, without presenting any data on hemagglutinin content per strain. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: None",
