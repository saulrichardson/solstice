  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A banner/header from the journal Vaccine (Elsevier) showing the journal title, logo, and homepage URL, without any data or tables about vaccine formulations or HA content. The image does not support the claim because it contains only the journal's title and logo information and provides no details on HA dosage for Flublok or standard-dose vaccines and thus doesn't support the claim. Note: The image appears to be a cover/header page and contains no relevant data. If other pages of the document contain dosage details, those were not visible here.",
