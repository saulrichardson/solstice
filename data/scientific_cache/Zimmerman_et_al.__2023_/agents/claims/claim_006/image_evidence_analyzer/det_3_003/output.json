  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants receiving RIV4 (recombinant influenza vaccine quadrivalent) versus SD-IIV4 (standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent), including counts and percentages for race, sex, season, age group, influenza case status, and high-risk condition, with p-values for differences. The table only presents recipient demographics and clinical characteristics for RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 and does not include any information on vaccine production methods or platforms, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table is clear but contains no manufacturing details; confidence in interpretation is high.",
