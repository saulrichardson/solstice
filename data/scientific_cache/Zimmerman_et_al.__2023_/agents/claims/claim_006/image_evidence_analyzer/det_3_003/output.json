  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Tabular data showing relative vaccine effectiveness comparisons among different influenza vaccines (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4, Adj-IV), including percentages and confidence intervals, with footnotes defining RIV4 as Flublok and SD-IIV4 as various standard-dose vaccines. The table only lists Flublok as RIV4 but provides no information on its production method or use of insect cells/Baculo virus expression system, so it does not support the claim. Note: The view is partial and focused on effectiveness data; no production details are visible.",
