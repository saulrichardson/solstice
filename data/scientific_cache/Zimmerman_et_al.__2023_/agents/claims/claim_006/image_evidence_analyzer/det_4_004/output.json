  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) percentages for RIV4 (Flublok) versus no vaccination and versus standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) across different groups (overall, by sex, age, risk condition, and season). does not support the claim because the table presents only vaccine effectiveness data and contains no information about Flublok's production platform, recombinant HA expression, insect cells, or baculovirus expression vector system. Note: Image is clear but focuses solely on effectiveness outcomes rather than manufacturing methods.",
