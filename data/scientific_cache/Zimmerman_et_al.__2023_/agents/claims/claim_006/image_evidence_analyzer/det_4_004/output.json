  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of RIV4 (Flublok) versus no vaccination and versus standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (SD-IIV4) across various subgroups (overall, sex, age groups, risk conditions, seasons) with percentages and 95% confidence intervals, including adjustments using different statistical methods. The table provides vaccine effectiveness data for Flublok (RIV4) compared to no vaccination and to SD-IIV4, but it contains no information about production methods, expression systems, or use of insect cells and baculovirus vectors, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear and legible, but its content is limited to effectiveness metrics and lacks manufacturing or platform details.",
