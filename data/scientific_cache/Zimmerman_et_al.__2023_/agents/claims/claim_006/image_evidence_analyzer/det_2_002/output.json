  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart showing participant numbers in a clinical study grouped by vaccine received: recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard dose influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), and unvaccinated, with counts for primary analyses. The image presents a CONSORT-style flowchart of study participants by vaccine group but contains no information on the production platform, expression system, or use of baculovirus in insect cells, and therefore does not support the claim.",
