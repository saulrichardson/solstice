  "explanation": "A flowchart of a study cohort (N=18,467) showing exclusions (n=3,347) to yield an analyzable cohort (N=14,590), which is split into controls (N=12,837) and influenza cases (N=1,803). Both groups are further subdivided by vaccine status: RIV4, SD-IIV4, and unvaccinated, with corresponding participant counts. The figure depicts participant flow and vaccine group sizes but provides no information on Flublok's production method or the use of a baculovirus expression vector system, so it does not support the claim.",
