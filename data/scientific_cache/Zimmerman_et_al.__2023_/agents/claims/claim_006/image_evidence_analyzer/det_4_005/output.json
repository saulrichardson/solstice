  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine effectiveness (VE, % with 95% CI) for different influenza vaccines (RIV4, SD-IIV4, and RIV4 with HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV) across two age groups (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years), broken down by overall population, sex, high-risk condition status, and influenza seasons. The table provides effectiveness data for RIV4 and other vaccines but contains no information on Flublok\u2019s production method or the use of recombinant HA expression in insect cells with a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible; however, it only addresses clinical effectiveness, not manufacturing processes.",
