  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A page excerpt showing narrative text describing clinical effectiveness of IIV4 against RT-PCR\u2013confirmed influenza-like illness with percentage and confidence interval data and a quote from a 2019 editorial by Flannery and Fry about evidence informing policy, plus truncated footer pagination (\u20185138\u2019). No table on production methods is visible. The image only presents clinical effectiveness data and an editorial quote; it does not support the claim about Flublok\u2019s novel production platform with recombinant HA expressed in insect cells using BEVS, as it contains no manufacturing details. Note: The visible portion may be truncated; if the actual table is elsewhere on the page, that content is not shown here.",
