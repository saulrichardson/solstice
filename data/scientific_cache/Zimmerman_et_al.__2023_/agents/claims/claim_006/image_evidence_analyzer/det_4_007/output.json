  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (race, sex, season, influenza case status, high-risk condition) for study participants aged 18\u201364 and \u226565 years, stratified by vaccine received (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4, Adj-IV) with counts, percentages, and P-values. The table presents participant demographics and vaccine types but contains no information about Flublok's production platform or use of insect cells and baculovirus vector system, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table content is clear; no production method details are present.",
