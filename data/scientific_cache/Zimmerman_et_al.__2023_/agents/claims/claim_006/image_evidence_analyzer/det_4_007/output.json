  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing vaccine effectiveness (VE, % with 95% CI) of various influenza vaccines, including recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), RIV4 + high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4) + adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Adj-IV), stratified by age groups (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years). The table presents clinical vaccine effectiveness data and does not include any information on production platform or expression system, therefore it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but focuses solely on effectiveness data; production details are not addressed.",
