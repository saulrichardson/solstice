  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining the study cohort (N=18,467 adults \u226518 years), exclusions (n=3,264), resulting analyzable cohort (N=15,203), and categorization into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868), each further subdivided by vaccine type: RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV, and unvaccinated. The figure presents a participant flowchart and vaccine group breakdown but does not include any information about Flublok's production platform, recombinant HA expression, insect cells, or use of a baculovirus expression vector system. Therefore, it does not support the claim.",
