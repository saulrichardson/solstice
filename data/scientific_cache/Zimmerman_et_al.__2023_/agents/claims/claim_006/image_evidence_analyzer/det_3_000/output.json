  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flow diagram showing the study cohort of adults \u226518 years (N=18,467), exclusions (n=3,264), resulting analyzable cohort (N=15,203) split into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868), with both groups further subdivided by vaccine type: recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), high-dose/adjuvanted IIV4, and unvaccinated, along with participant counts for each. The figure only presents participant flow and vaccine group labels (including RIV4) without any details on Flublok\u2019s production platform or use of insect cells and BEVS, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is a flowchart of study design and does not include technical or manufacturing information.",
