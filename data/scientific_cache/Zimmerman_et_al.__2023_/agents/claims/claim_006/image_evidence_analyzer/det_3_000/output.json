  "explanation": "Flowchart outlining a study cohort of adults \u226518 years (N=18,467), exclusions (n=3,264), resulting in an analyzable cohort (N=15,203) split into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868), each further subdivided by vaccine type: RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4+Adj-IV, and unvaccinated with respective counts. The figure only shows participant flow and vaccine group counts; it does not describe Flublok\u2019s production platform, so it does not support the claim",
