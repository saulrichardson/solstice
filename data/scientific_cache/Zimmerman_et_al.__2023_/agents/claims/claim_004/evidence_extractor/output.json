      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that the recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4, a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) provided better protection compared to the standard-dose egg-based vaccine (SD-IIV4), supporting the claim that RIV4 induces a more robust antibody response."

      "quote": "Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneficiaries study [10] using retrospective data as described above, reported significant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4 against influenza related hospital encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults 50 years old, but not for adults 65 years old [11].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote references two studies that found significant relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) compared to the standard-dose egg-based vaccine (SD-IIV4), providing evidence that RIV4 may induce a more robust antibody response."
