      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct comparative data showing that a higher-dose (HD-IIV4) vaccine has greater relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) than the standard-dose egg-based vaccine, supporting the claim that higher-dose vaccines induce a more robust antibody response."

      "quote": "Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneficiaries study [10] using retrospective data as described above, reported significant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4 against influenza related hospital encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults 50 years old, but not for adults 65 years old [11].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote references studies that found recombinant (higher-dose) flu vaccines (RIV4) to be significantly more effective than standard-dose egg-based vaccines (SD-IIV4), directly supporting the claim."

      "quote": "Adjusted VEs for RIV4 for younger adults were significant across all subgroups, whereas, VE for SD-IIV4 was significant for males only. Among older adults, VE of RIV4 was significant for females (47%; 95% CI = 30, 60) but not males (2%; 95% CI = -33, 21) or for those with and without high risk conditions.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides specific vaccine effectiveness (VE) data showing that RIV4 (recombinant, higher-dose) was more effective than SD-IIV4 (standard-dose, egg-based) in several subgroups, supporting the claim."
