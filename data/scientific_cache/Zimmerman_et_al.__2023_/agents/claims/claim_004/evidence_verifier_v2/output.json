It explicitly states that the study supports the superior effectiveness of RIV4 over SD-IIV4 for adults 18-64 years of age, which is consistent with the claim of a more robust response. The document's context is about vaccine effectiveness, which is a direct measure of the immune response's robustness in a real-world setting.",

The wording is not a perfect match to the provided quote, but the semantic content is the same: it states that the study supports the superior effectiveness of the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) over the standard-dose egg-based vaccine (SD-IIV4) for adults aged 18-64.",
