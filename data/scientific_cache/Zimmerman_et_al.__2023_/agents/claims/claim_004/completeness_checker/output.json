      "quote": "Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneficiaries study [10] using retrospective data as described above, reported significant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4) against influenza related hospital encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults 50 years old, but not for adults 65 years old [11].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly references studies that found recombinant (higher-dose) flu vaccine (RIV4) had significantly greater relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines (SD-IIV4), supporting the claim that RIV4 induces a more robust antibody response."
