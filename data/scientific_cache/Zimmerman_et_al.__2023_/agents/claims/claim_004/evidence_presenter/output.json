      "explanation": "The quote 'all adults, and supports its superior effectiveness over SD IIV4 for adults 18-64 years of age.' appears on page 6 of the document, in the section discussing the study's findings and strengths/limitations. The wording is an exact match, and the context is a summary of the study's results regarding the effectiveness of RIV4 compared to SD-IIV4 in adults 18-64 years old.. The quote directly states that the study supports the superior effectiveness of RIV4 (a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) over SD-IIV4 (egg-based standard-dose vaccine) for adults 18-64 years of age. This directly supports the claim that vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response (as measured by effectiveness) than egg-based standard-dose vaccines, at least in the specified age group."
