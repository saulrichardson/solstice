      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim that vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. It explicitly states that the study supports the superior effectiveness of RIV4 over SD-IIV4 for adults 18-64 years of age, which is consistent with the claim of a more robust response. The document's context is about vaccine effectiveness, which is a direct measure of the immune response's robustness in a real-world setting."
