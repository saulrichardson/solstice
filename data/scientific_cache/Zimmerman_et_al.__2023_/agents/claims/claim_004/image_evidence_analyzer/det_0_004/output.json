  "explanation": "Partial screenshot of the first page header of an Elsevier journal article titled \u2018Vaccine effectiveness of recombinant and standard dose influenza vaccines against influenza related hospitalization using a retrospective\u2026\u2019. It shows the journal name \u2018Vaccine\u2019 and part of the article title. The image does not present any immunogenicity or antibody response data comparing higher-dose recombinant vaccines to egg-based standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim.
