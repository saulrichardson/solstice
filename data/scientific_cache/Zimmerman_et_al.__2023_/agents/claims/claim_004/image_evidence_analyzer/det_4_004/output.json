  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a high-dose recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus no vaccination and of standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) versus no vaccination, as well as relative VE of RIV4 compared to SD-IIV4 across subgroups (overall, sex, age, risk status, seasons). Evidence: Relative VE of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 ranging from 21% to 31% in the overall population and various subgroups. The table presents clinical vaccine effectiveness estimates, not antibody titers or immunogenicity measures, and therefore does not support the claim that a higher-dose recombinant vaccine induces a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: Immunogenicity data (antibody response) are not shown; table focuses on clinical effectiveness. ",
