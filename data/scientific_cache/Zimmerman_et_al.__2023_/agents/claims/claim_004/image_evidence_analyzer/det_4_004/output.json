  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates (percent reduction with 95% confidence intervals) for recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Flublok) versus standard-dose egg-based vaccines (Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, SD Fluzone, FlucelVax). Estimates are shown overall and stratified by sex, age group, risk status, and season, with varying adjustments (unadjusted, adjusted for covariates, propensity score, inverse probability weighting). The table provides observational effectiveness estimates, not measurements of antibody responses; it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible table; immunogenicity data (antibody titers) are not presented.",
