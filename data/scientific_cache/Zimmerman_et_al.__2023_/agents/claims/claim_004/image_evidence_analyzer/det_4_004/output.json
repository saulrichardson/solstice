  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-column table comparing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus no vaccination, adjusted VE of standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) versus no vaccination, and the relative VE of RIV4 compared to SD-IIV4 (percent reduction in outcomes with 95% CIs) across overall and subgroup populations (sex, age, risk condition, season). The table reports clinical vaccine effectiveness outcomes rather than immunogenicity or antibody response data and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear and legible but contains no antibody titre or immune response measurements; conclusions about antibody responses cannot be drawn from VE data.",
