  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants (total N=14,590), subdivided into those who received RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine, n=3,338) and those who received SD-IIV4 (standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine, n=976). Measures include race, sex, season (2018\u20132019 vs 2019\u20132020), age group (18\u201364 vs \u226565 years), influenza case status, and presence of high-risk conditions, with p-values for differences between RIV4 and SD-IIV4 groups. The table does not present any antibody response or immunogenicity data; it only compares participant demographics and case status, and therefore does not support the claim.",
