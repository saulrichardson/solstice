  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics comparing individuals who received the higher-dose recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus those who received the egg-based standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4). It lists counts and percentages for race, sex, season, age group, influenza case status, and presence of high-risk conditions, along with P-values for differences between the two vaccine groups. This table only presents baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of recipients of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 and does not include any data on antibody responses or immunogenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but limited to demographic data; no immunogenicity results are shown.",
