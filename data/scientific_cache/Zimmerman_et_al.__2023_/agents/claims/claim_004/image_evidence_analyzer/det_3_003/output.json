  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A text excerpt from page 4 discussing relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus standard\u2010dose egg\u2010based inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) in adults hospitalized for acute respiratory infections, including overall and subgroup rVE percentages and confidence intervals. The excerpt presents clinical effectiveness data (rVE) for RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 but does not provide any immunogenicity or antibody response results; it does not support the claim about a more robust antibody response. Note: The image is a partial text excerpt focused on effectiveness outcomes; immunogenicity data are not present.",
