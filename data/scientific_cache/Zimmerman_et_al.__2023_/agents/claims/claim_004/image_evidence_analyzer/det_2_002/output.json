  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A flowchart showing participant counts for three groups: recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) n=3,047, standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) n=862, and unvaccinated n=8,878; followed by numbers included in primary analyses: RIV4 n=291, SD-IIV4 n=114, and unvaccinated n=1,398. The figure is only a flow diagram of enrollment and sample sizes and does not support the claim as it contains no data on antibody responses. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody titer data are shown; only participant counts are provided.",
