  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the selection of an adult study cohort (N=18,467), exclusions leading to an analyzable cohort (N=14,590), and division into controls (N=12,837) and influenza cases (N=1,803), each further stratified by vaccine type (recombinant quadrivalent RIV4, egg-based standard-dose SD-IIV4) and unvaccinated groups, with sample sizes for each subgroup. The figure only shows cohort selection and group sizes by vaccine type and case/control status; it contains no data on antibody responses or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody titer data are presented in this flowchart; analysis limited to study population breakdown.",
