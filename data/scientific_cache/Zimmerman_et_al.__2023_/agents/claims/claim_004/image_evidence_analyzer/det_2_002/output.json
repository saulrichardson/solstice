  "explanation": "Flowchart depicting selection of a study cohort (age \u226518 years, N=18,467), exclusions (n=3,347), resulting in an analyzable cohort (N=14,590) divided into controls (N=12,837) and influenza cases (N=1,803), with subgroup counts for recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), and unvaccinated individuals. The figure only shows participant flow and group sizes by vaccine type; it does not show any antibody response or immunogenicity data, so it does not support the claim.",
