  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants by vaccine group (18\u201364 years: RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4; \u226565 years: SD-IIV4, RIV4, and combined RIV4+HD-IIV4+Adj-IV), showing counts, percentages, and P-values for race, sex, season, influenza case status, and high-risk condition. The table presents only baseline demographic and clinical characteristics across vaccine groups and contains no data on antibody responses or immunogenicity measures; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible data; table does not include immunogenicity or antibody titer outcomes.",
