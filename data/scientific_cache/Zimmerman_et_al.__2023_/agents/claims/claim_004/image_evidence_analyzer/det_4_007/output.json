  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table displaying vaccine effectiveness (VE, % with 95% CI) of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), and RIV4 combined with high-dose and adjuvanted IIV4 (HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV), stratified by age groups (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years) and subpopulations (overall, males, females). Evidence: VE estimates: In 18\u201364 years, RIV4 VE 47% (35,56) vs SD-IIV4 VE 27% (8,42); in \u226565 years, RIV4 + HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV VE 24% (11,36) vs SD-IIV4 VE 9% (\u201342,42). The table presents vaccine effectiveness data, not antibody response measurements, and therefore does not support the claim about a more robust antibody response induced by higher-dose recombinant vaccine; it only provides comparative effectiveness estimates, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table reports VE rather than immunogenicity outcomes; image text is partially visible but sufficient for VE values; no direct antibody titer data present.",
