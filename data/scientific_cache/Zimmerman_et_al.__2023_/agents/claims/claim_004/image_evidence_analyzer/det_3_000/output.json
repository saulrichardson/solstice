  "explanation": "A flowchart of a study cohort (N=18,467 adults \u226518 years) showing exclusions (n=3,264), an analyzable cohort (N=15,203), and subdivision into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868) with counts for four groups: RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV, and unvaccinated. The figure is a participant flow diagram with group sizes and does not present any antibody titer or immunogenicity data, so it does not support the claim.",
