  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",

  "explanation": "Flow diagram of study cohort selection: starting with age \u226518 years participants (N=18,467), exclusions for recent influenza, unknown vaccination status, immunocompromised (n=3,264), resulting in an analyzable cohort (N=15,203). This cohort is divided into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868), with each group further subdivided by vaccine type (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4+Adj-IV) and unvaccinated, showing participant counts for each category. The figure presents only participant flow and group sizes by vaccine type and does not include any measurements of antibody response; it does not support the claim. Note: The image is limited to cohort selection and does not display immunogenicity or antibody data; no conclusions about antibody response can be drawn from this figure alone.",
