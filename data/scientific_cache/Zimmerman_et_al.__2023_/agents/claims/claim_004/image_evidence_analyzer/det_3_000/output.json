  "explanation": "Flowchart depicting study cohort selection and vaccine group distribution. Starts with 18,467 adults, excludes 3,264, yielding 15,203 analyzable subjects split into controls (13,385) and influenza cases (1,868). Each group is further divided by vaccine type: RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4+Adj-IV, and unvaccinated, with corresponding sample sizes. The figure only shows participant flow and numbers by vaccine type, without any data on antibody responses, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody titer data are presented in the figure; only cohort counts are shown.",
