  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing vaccine effectiveness (VE, % with 95% CI) of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus egg-based standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) in adults 18\u201364 years and \u226565 years, with subgroup analyses by sex, risk status, and season. For \u226565 years, an additional column shows combined RIV4 + high-dose IIV4 + adjuvanted IIV (Adj-IV) VE. Evidence: In 18\u201364-year-olds, RIV4 VE is 47% (35, 56) versus SD-IIV4 VE 27% (8, 42). The table presents real-world VE data rather than antibody response or higher-dose recombinant vaccine immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim Note: The table reports vaccine effectiveness, not immunogenicity or antibody titers; no high-dose recombinant formulation is shown; some CIs are wide and groupings for \u226565 combine multiple vaccines.",
