  "explanation": "A text excerpt on page 5 showing a table of influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) percentages with 95% confidence intervals against RT-PCR\u2013confirmed and culture-positive influenza-like illness in age groups (50\u201364 years and \u226565 years), referencing a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries and an editorial comment. The content presents vaccine effectiveness estimates against clinical endpoints but does not include any immunogenicity or antibody titer data, so it does not support the claim Note: Table focuses on clinical effectiveness (IVE) rather than antibody responses; limited resolution prevents seeing potential immunogenicity measures, but no such data are visible",
