  "claim_id": "claim_004",
  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing vaccine effectiveness (VE) percentages (with 95% confidence intervals) for recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (SD-IIV4) in two age groups (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years), with additional columns for HD-IIV4 and adjuvanted IIV in the \u226565 group. Evidence: For 18\u201364\u2009year\u2009olds, RIV4 shows VE 47% (35\u201356) versus SD-IIV4 VE 27% (8\u201342); for \u226565\u2009year\u2009olds, RIV4 VE 27% (12\u201339) versus SD-IIV4 VE 9% (\u201342\u201342). The table provides comparative clinical effectiveness data, not antibody response measurements, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear but presents VE data rather than immunogenicity or antibody titers, limiting direct relevance to the claim about antibody response.",
