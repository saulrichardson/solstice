  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing characteristics of three influenza vaccines\u2014quadrivalent recombinant (RIV4), high-dose egg-based inactivated (HD-IIV4), and standard-dose egg-based inactivated (SD-IIV4)\u2014including antigen content per strain, production substrate, and absence of adjuvant. The table only lists formulation details (e.g., HA micrograms per strain, production method) and does not provide any immunogenicity or antibody response data, so it does not support the claim. Note: No antibody titer or clinical immunogenicity results are presented; conclusions about immune response cannot be drawn from this table.",
