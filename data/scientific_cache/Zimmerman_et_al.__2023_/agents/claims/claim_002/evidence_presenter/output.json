      "explanation": "The quote 'because it is not subject to mutations to the A (H3N2) glycosylation binding site that reduce the effectiveness of egg based vaccines.' appears on page 6 of the document. The wording matches the provided quote, and the factual content is preserved.. The quote directly states that egg-based vaccines can develop mutations at the A (H3N2) glycosylation binding site, which reduce their effectiveness. This explicitly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote specifically links mutations in egg-based vaccine production to reduced effectiveness, thus substantiating the claim."
