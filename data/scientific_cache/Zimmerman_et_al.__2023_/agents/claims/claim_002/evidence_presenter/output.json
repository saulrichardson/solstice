      "explanation": "The quote directly states that egg-based vaccines are subject to mutations at the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site, and that these mutations reduce their effectiveness. This explicitly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote specifically addresses egg-based vaccines, confirming the claim for that production method."
