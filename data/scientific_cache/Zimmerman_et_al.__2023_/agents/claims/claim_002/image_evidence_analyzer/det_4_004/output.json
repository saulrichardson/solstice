  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) for recombinant influenza vaccine quadrivalent (RIV4) and standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (SD-IIV4) compared to no vaccination, as well as the relative VE of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 across subgroups (overall, by sex, age, risk condition, and season), with 95% confidence intervals and different adjustment methods. The table provides comparative effectiveness data between RIV4 and SD-IIV4 but contains no information about mutation development during vaccine production or its impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to the visible portion of the table; no mechanism or production details are shown.",
