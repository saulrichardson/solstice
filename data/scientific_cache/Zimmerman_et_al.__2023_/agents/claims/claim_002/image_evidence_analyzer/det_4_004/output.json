  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing relative vaccine effectiveness (VE) of recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4: Flublok) versus standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIV4: Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, SD Fluzone, and Flucelvax) across overall and subgroup populations (sex, age, risk condition, season) using various adjustment methods (unadjusted with a priori variables, propensity score, inverse probability weighting). The table provides VE percentages and confidence intervals for different vaccine formulations and subgroups; it does not present any information about mutations arising during cell- or egg-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Table content is clear but does not address production mutations; resolution and context limit assessment to VE comparisons only.",
