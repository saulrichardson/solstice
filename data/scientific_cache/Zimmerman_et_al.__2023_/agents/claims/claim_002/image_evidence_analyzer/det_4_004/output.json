  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) for recombinant influenza vaccine quadrivalent (RIV4) and standard-dose egg-based influenza vaccine quadrivalent (SD-IIV4) compared to no vaccination, and the relative vaccine effectiveness of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 (percent with 95% CI) across subgroups (overall, sex, age groups, risk condition status, and influenza seasons). The table does not support the claim because it only presents effectiveness data for RIV4 and egg-based SD-IIV4 vaccines without any information on mutations arising during production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness, so it doesn\u2019t support the claim. Note: Table text is clear; no mention of mutations or production-related antigenic changes.",
