  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing demographic and clinical characteristics (race, sex, influenza season, influenza cases, high-risk conditions) among adults aged 18\u201364 and \u226565 who received different influenza vaccines (RIV4 recombinant, SD-IIV4 standard-dose inactivated, and in \u226565 also HD-IIV4 high-dose and adjuvanted). Each cell shows counts (n) and percentages with P-values for group comparisons. The table presents baseline characteristics and influenza case rates for recipients of different vaccine formulations but contains no information on mutations arising during cell- or egg-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table is clear and intact; no mechanistic data on production mutations are present.",
