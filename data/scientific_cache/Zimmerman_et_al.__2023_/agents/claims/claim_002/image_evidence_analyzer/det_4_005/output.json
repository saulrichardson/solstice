  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine effectiveness (VE, % with 95% CI) for different influenza vaccine types (RIV4 and SD-IIV4 for ages 18\u201364; RIV4, RIV4 + HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV, and SD-IIV4 for \u226565) across various subgroups (overall, by sex, risk condition) and seasons (2018\u201319, 2019\u201320). The table reports observed VE percentages for recombinant (RIV4) versus standard egg-based (SD-IIV4) vaccines but contains no information on mutations arising during production or their impact on effectiveness and therefore does not support the claim.
