  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial page of text from a clinical review describing effectiveness estimates for quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) against RT-PCR confirmed ILI and culture-positive ILI in different age groups, followed by commentary from a 2019 editorial on study design and policy decisions. The excerpt contains vaccine effectiveness data and editorial commentary but makes no mention of cell- or egg-based vaccine production or potential mutations arising during manufacturing, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is a cut-off text snippet with no table visible; low resolution and incomplete context but no relevant content on mutations or production methods.",
