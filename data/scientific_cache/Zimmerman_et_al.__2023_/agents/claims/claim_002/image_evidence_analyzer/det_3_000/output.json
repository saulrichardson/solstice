  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "Flowchart illustrating the selection of a study cohort (age \u226518 years), exclusions (e.g., immunocompromised, unknown vaccination status), resulting analyzable cohort (N=15,203), and breakdown of controls and influenza cases by vaccine type (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4+Adj-IV, unvaccinated) with corresponding participant counts. The figure is a cohort flow diagram showing participant inclusion, exclusion, and vaccine group counts; it does not provide any information on mutations arising during cell- or egg-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim.",
