  "explanation": "A flowchart showing participant selection for a study of adults \u226518 years (N=18,467), exclusions (n=3,264), resulting in an analyzable cohort (N=15,203) split into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868), with both groups further subdivided by vaccine type (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4+Adj-IV, and unvaccinated). The figure does not support the claim because it contains only participant numbers and vaccine categories, with no data or statements about mutations occurring during cell- or egg-based vaccine production or effects on effectiveness.
