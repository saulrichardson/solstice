  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the derivation of a study cohort (N=18,467), exclusions (n=3,264), an analyzable cohort (N=15,203), and subsequent division into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868). Each group is further subdivided by vaccine type: RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV, and unvaccinated, with respective counts. The figure only shows participant flow and vaccine group sizes; it does not present any data or statements about mutations arising during egg- or cell-based vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim.",
