  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants (N=14,590) overall and by vaccine received (RIV4 recombinant vaccine n=3,338 vs SD-IIV4 egg-based vaccine n=976). Measures include race, sex, influenza season, age group, influenza case status, high-risk conditions, and p-values for differences between the two vaccine groups. The table provides demographic and case-count data comparing recipients of RIV4 and SD-IIV4 but contains no information on vaccine production methods, mutations during production, or effects on effectiveness and therefore does not support the claim.",
