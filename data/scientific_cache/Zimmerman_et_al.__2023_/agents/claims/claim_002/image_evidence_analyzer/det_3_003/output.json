  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of baseline characteristics for 14,590 subjects, showing counts and percentages of recipients of RIV4 (n=3,338) versus SD-IIV4 (n=976) by race, sex, season, age group, influenza case status, and high-risk conditions, with P-values for differences between vaccine groups. The table only presents demographic and clinical characteristics of vaccine recipients and P-values for group differences; it does not contain any information about vaccine production, mutations, or impacts on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear and complete for its scope, but it does not address vaccine mutation or effectiveness mechanisms.",
