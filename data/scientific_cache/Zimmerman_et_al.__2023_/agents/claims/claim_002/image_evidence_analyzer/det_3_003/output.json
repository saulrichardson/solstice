  "explanation": "Partial capture of a table\u2019s footnotes and accompanying text defining vaccine abbreviations (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4, Adj-IV) and reporting vaccine effectiveness percentages in different age and risk groups. No mention of production mutations. The content does not support the claim because there is no discussion of vaccine production mutations or their impact on effectiveness; it only reports effectiveness comparisons among vaccine types, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image is a partial view and may not include all table sections, but visible text contains no reference to mutations.",
