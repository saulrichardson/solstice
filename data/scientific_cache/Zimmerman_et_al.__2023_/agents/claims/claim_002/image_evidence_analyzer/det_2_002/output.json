  "explanation": "A flowchart showing selection of a study cohort (age \u226518 years, N=18,467), exclusion criteria, resulting in an analyzable cohort (N=14,590) divided into controls (N=12,837) and influenza cases (N=1,803), then further categorized by vaccination status: RIV4, SD-IIV4, and unvaccinated. The figure only presents the study population selection and distribution of vaccine groups; it does not mention mutations during production or effectiveness implications and therefore does not support the claim.",
