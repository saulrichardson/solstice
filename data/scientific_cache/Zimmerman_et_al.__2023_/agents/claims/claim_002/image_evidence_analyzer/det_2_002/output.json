  "explanation": "A flow diagram showing the numbers of study participants included in primary analyses: boxes labeled RIV4 (n=3,047), SD-IIV4 (n=862), and Unvaccinated (n=8,878) for one cohort, and RIV4 (n=291), SD-IIV4 (n=114), and Unvaccinated (n=1,398) for another cohort, with accompanying text describing that only participants receiving recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine, standard dose influenza vaccine, or unvaccinated were included. The figure is a participant flow chart with sample sizes and contains no data or statements about mutations arising during vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness. It does not support the claim. Note: None",
