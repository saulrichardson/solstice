  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flowchart detailing patient selection for a clinical study: initial cohort (N=18,467 adults \u226518 years), exclusions (n=3,347) for recent influenza, unknown vaccination, immunocompromise, or receipt of high-dose/adjuvanted vaccines, yielding an analyzable cohort (N=14,590). This cohort divides into controls (n=12,837) and influenza cases (n=1,803), each further categorized by vaccination status: RIV4, SD-IIV4, and unvaccinated with corresponding counts. The figure only shows study cohort selection and vaccination group sizes; it does not present any data on vaccine production methods, mutations, or their impact on effectiveness and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image quality is clear; content fully visible with no relevant data on mutations or production processes.",
