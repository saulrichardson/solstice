      "explanation": "The quote directly states that egg-based vaccines are subject to mutations at the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site, and that these mutations reduce their effectiveness. This explicitly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote is specific about the type of mutation and its impact on vaccine efficacy, thus directly substantiating the claim.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote 'because it is not subject to mutations to the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site that reduce the effectiveness of egg based vaccines.' appears on page 6 of the document. The wording is an exact match, and the context is discussing the advantages of certain vaccines over egg-based vaccines.",
      "support_explanation": "The quote directly states that egg-based vaccines are subject to mutations at the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site, and that these mutations reduce their effectiveness. This explicitly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote is specific about the type of mutation and its impact on vaccine efficacy, thus directly substantiating the claim.",
      "original_relevance": "This quote explicitly states that egg-based vaccines can develop mutations at the A (H3 N2) glycosylation binding site, which can reduce their effectiveness. This directly supports the claim that mutations during production may impact vaccine efficacy."
