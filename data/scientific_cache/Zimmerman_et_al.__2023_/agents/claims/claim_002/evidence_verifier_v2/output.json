The wording matches the provided quote, and the factual content is preserved.. The quote directly states that egg-based vaccines can develop mutations at the A (H3N2) glycosylation binding site, which reduce their effectiveness. This explicitly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The quote specifically links mutations in egg-based vaccine production to reduced effectiveness, thus substantiating the claim.",

      "quote": "Several studies of cell cultured influenza vaccine were conducted prior to the 2019-2020 season (when all four vaccine strains were cell cultured and have not shown significant rVE against influenza illness compared with SD-IIV4 [9]. A large retrospective study of Medicare beneficiaries (65 years of age) in the 2019-2020 season demonstrated no significant rVE of cell cultured quad rival ent influenza vaccine (ccIIV4) compared with SD-IIV4 against influenza related hospital encounters [10]. However the study was limited by the fact that there were no R. K. Zimmerman, M. Patricia No walk, K. Dauer et al.",

      "original_explanation": "This quote discusses the lack of significant relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of cell-cultured influenza vaccines compared to standard egg-based vaccines, which is relevant because it suggests that mutations or changes during production may impact the effectiveness of cell-based vaccines."
