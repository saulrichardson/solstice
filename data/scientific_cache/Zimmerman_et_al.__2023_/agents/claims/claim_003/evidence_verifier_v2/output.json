      "original_explanation": "This quote directly addresses a mechanism by which recombinant technology avoids a key limitation of traditional egg-based vaccines, supporting the claim that recombinant vaccines can provide broader immune responses and potentially better cross-protection, especially in seasons where circulating strains differ from those used in vaccine production."

      "reason": "does not support claim",

      "quote": "Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneficiaries study [10] using retrospective data as described above, reported significant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4 against influenza related hospital encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults 50 years old, but not for adults 65 years old [11].",
