      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by explaining that recombinant technology avoids a key limitation of egg-based vaccines, which can lead to broader immune responses and potentially better cross-protection, especially in seasons where the circulating strain does not match the vaccine strain due to such mutations."

      "quote": "Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneficiaries study [10] using retrospective data as described above, reported significant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4 against influenza related hospital encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults 50 years old, but not for adults 65 years old [11].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence from multiple studies that recombinant vaccines (RIV4) offer superior protection compared to standard dose inactivated vaccines (SD-IIV4), supporting the idea that recombinant technology leads to a broader and more effective immune response."

      "quote": "Adjusted VEs for RIV4 for younger adults were significant across all subgroups, whereas, VE for SD-IIV4 was significant for males only.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote demonstrates that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) provided significant protection across a wider range of subgroups compared to the standard vaccine, indicating a broader immune response."
