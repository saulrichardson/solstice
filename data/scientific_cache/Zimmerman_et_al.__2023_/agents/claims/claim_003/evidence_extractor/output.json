      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly addresses a mechanism by which recombinant technology avoids a key limitation of traditional egg-based vaccines, supporting the claim that recombinant vaccines can provide broader immune responses and potentially better cross-protection, especially in seasons where circulating strains differ from those used in vaccine production."

      "quote": "Conclusions: Over all adults, both RIV4 and SD-IIV4 were effective against influenza hospitalization, RIV4 providing better protection compared with SD-IIV4 overall, for females, younger adults, and those with no high risk conditions.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This statement provides direct evidence that recombinant technology (RIV4) resulted in better protection than standard dose inactivated vaccines, supporting the claim that recombinant vaccines can lead to a broader or more effective immune response."

      "quote": "Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneficiaries study [10] using retrospective data as described above, reported significant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4 against influenza related hospital encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults 50 years old, but not for adults 65 years old [11].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote references studies showing that recombinant vaccines (RIV4) provided significant protection compared to standard vaccines, which supports the claim that recombinant technology can lead to broader or more effective immune responses, potentially including cross-protection."
