  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine effectiveness (VE) percentages (with 95% CI) for recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), and RIV4 plus high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, compared with no vaccination, stratified by age groups (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years) and subgroups (overall, males, females). The table reports VE percentages for RIV4 and comparator vaccines against influenza, but it does not address broader immune responses, cross-protection, or effectiveness in mismatch seasons, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and complete for VE data, but contains no information on mismatch season performance or cross-protection.",
