  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing baseline characteristics and influenza case counts among recipients of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) and standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) (and high-dose/adjuvanted IIV in \u226565 group) stratified by age group (18\u201364 and \u226565 years), including race, sex, season distribution, influenza case numbers, and high-risk conditions, with P-values for between-group comparisons. The table presents demographic characteristics and influenza case rates by vaccine type but provides no data on immune response breadth or cross-protection in a mismatch season, and so does not support the claim. Note: Table appears to be baseline and clinical outcome data, not immunogenicity or antigenic breadth measures; image quality is sufficient but content is not directly relevant to immune response breadth or cross-protection.",
