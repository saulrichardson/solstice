  "explanation": "A comparative table of baseline characteristics and influenza case rates by vaccine type (RIV4 vs SD-IIV4 in 18\u201364 year olds; SD-IIV4, RIV4, and RIV4+HD-IIV4+Adj-IIV in \u226565 year olds) across two influenza seasons (2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020), showing n (%) and P-values for demographic factors, season distribution, influenza cases, and high-risk conditions. The table presents demographic characteristics and crude influenza case rates by vaccine group, but contains no data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or mismatch season performance by recombinant vaccine versus other platforms, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible table data; no immunogenicity or strain-specific mismatch information provided.",
