  "explanation": "A table showing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus no vaccination, and of standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) versus no vaccination, as well as relative VE of RIV4 compared to SD-IIV4 across subgroups (overall, by sex, age, risk condition) and by season (2018\u20132019, 2019\u20132020). The table presents vaccine effectiveness estimates but does not address breadth of immune response, cross-protection, or mismatch seasons. It contains no data on recombinant technology\u2013induced broader immunity or cross-protection, so it does not support the claim.",
