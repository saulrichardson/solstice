  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing vaccine effectiveness (VE) percentages (with 95% CIs) of the recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4: Flublok) versus standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccines (SD-IIV4: Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, SD Fluzone, FluCelVax) across various subgroups (overall, sex, age groups, high-risk status) and seasons (2018\u20132019, 2019\u20132020), using unadjusted, multivariable, propensity-score, and inverse probability weighting analyses. The table only reports comparative VE estimates by subgroup and season and does not present data on immune response breadth or cross-reactive protection in a mismatch season; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Table does not specify mismatch status or immunogenicity endpoints; conclusions about cross-protection cannot be drawn from VE data alone.",
