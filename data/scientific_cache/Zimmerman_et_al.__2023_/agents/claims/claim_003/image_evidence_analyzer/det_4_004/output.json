  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus no vaccination and standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) versus no vaccination, and the relative VE of RIV4 compared to SD-IIV4, across overall population, sex, age groups, risk condition status, and the 2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020 seasons with 95% confidence intervals. The table provides clinical effectiveness percentages for RIV4 and SD-IIV4 and their relative VE across subgroups and seasons but does not present any immunologic data on breadth of immune response or explicit evidence of cross-protection in mismatch seasons, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table does not indicate which seasons had strain mismatch or include immunologic endpoints; limited to effectiveness outcomes.",
