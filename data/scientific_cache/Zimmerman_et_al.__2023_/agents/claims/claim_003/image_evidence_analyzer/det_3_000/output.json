  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the derivation of a study cohort (N=18,467 adults \u226518 years), exclusions (n=3,264), an analyzable cohort (N=15,203), and the breakdown of controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868) by vaccine type (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV, unvaccinated). The figure only shows cohort numbers and vaccine group assignments; it does not present any data on immune response breadth or cross-protection, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image contains only participant flow and vaccine group counts, with no immunogenicity or cross-protection outcomes.",
