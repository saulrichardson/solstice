  "explanation": "A flow diagram showing study cohort enrollment (N=18,467), exclusions, an analyzable cohort (N=15,203) split into controls and influenza cases, each further categorized by vaccine type (recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine [RIV4], standard-dose IIV4 [SD-IIV4], high-dose IIV4 plus adjuvanted IIV4 [HD-IIV4+Adj-IV], and unvaccinated) with participant counts. A partial table header presents total and subgroup numbers and P-values for demographic differences between RIV4 and SD-IIV4 recipients. The figure only depicts participant flow and subgroup counts without any immunogenicity or cross-protection data, and therefore does not support the claim Note: Figure appears cut off at table; no immunologic or efficacy outcomes shown",
