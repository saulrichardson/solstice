  "explanation": "Flowchart of a clinical study cohort showing enrollment of adults (N=18,467), exclusions (n=3,264), resulting analyzable cohort (N=15,203), then division into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868), with further breakdown by vaccine type (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4+Adjuvant, and unvaccinated) and corresponding counts. The figure only depicts participant flow and group sizes by vaccination status; it contains no immunogenicity data or evidence of breadth of immune response or cross-protection in a mismatch season and therefore does not support the claim.
