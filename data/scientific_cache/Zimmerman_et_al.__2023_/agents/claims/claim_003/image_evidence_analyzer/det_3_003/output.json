  "explanation": "A table comparing total participants (N=14,590) and subgroups who received recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4, n=3,338) or standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4, n=976). Measures include race, sex, season (2018\u20132019 vs 2019\u20132020), age group (18\u201364 vs \u226565 years), influenza case status (case vs non-case), and presence of high-risk conditions, with corresponding counts, percentages, and p-values for differences between RIV4 and SD-IIV4. does not support the claim: the table provides participant demographics, case counts, and p-values but contains no immunogenicity or immune response breadth data assessing cross-protection or performance in a mismatch season. Note: The table is limited to baseline characteristics and influenza case counts; it does not present immunologic outcomes or evidence of broader immune responses.",
