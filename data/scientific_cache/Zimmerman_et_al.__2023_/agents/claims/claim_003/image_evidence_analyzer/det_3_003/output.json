  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants who received recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), including race, sex, season (2018\u20132019 vs 2019\u20132020), age group, influenza case status, and presence of high-risk conditions, with P-values for differences between vaccine groups. The table presents baseline demographics and the proportion of influenza cases in each vaccine group but does not include any data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or performance in mismatch seasons. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible data; table resolution is sufficient to confirm absence of immunogenicity or cross-protection metrics.",
