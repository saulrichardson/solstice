  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial scanned page showing text paragraphs and references, including efficacy data for IIV4 in 50\u201364-year-olds (RT-PCR ILI 42% [95% CI 15, 61]; culture-positive ILI 44% [96% CI 10, 65]) and mention of a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries \u226565 years in 2019\u20132020 by Izurieta et al., plus an editorial quote from Flannery and Fry on study methods. The image contains only efficacy data for standard inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4) and commentary on study design; it does not mention recombinant technology, broader immune responses, or cross-protection in mismatch seasons, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is a text excerpt rather than a table; it does not address recombinant vaccines, so absence of evidence may reflect scope of the excerpt rather than full document.",
