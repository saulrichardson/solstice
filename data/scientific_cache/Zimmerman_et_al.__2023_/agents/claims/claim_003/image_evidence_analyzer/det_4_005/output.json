  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine effectiveness (VE%) with 95% confidence intervals for recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) and standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) in adults aged 18\u201364 and \u226565 years, including subgroups by sex, risk condition, and 2018\u20132019 vs 2019\u20132020 seasons. In the \u226565 group, VE for RIV4, RIV4+HD-IIV4+Adj-IIV, and SD-IIV4 are shown. The table provides overall VE estimates by age, subgroup, and season but does not present data on cross-protection in mismatch seasons or demonstrate broader immune responses, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table does not specify match vs mismatch seasons or strain-specific outcomes, limiting interpretation regarding cross-protection.",
