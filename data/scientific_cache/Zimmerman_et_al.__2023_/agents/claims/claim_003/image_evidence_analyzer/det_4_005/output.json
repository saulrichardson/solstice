  "explanation": "A table reporting vaccine effectiveness (VE, %) with 95% confidence intervals for recombinant influenza vaccine quadrivalent (RIV4) versus standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (SD-IIV4) in adults aged 18\u201364 and \u226565 years, stratified by overall, sex, risk condition status, and by 2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020 seasons (with an additional column for high-dose/adjuvanted vaccines in \u226565). The table shows comparative VE percentages for RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 across age groups and seasons but does not specify vaccine\u2013strain mismatch seasons or demonstrate cross-protection data against heterologous strains. Therefore, it does not support the claim that recombinant technology leads to broader immunity and cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: Analysis limited to visible data; seasonal mismatch status is not indicated in the table.",
