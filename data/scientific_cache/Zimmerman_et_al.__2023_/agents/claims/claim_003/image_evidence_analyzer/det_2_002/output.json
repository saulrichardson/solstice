  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting study participant selection and grouping: starting with a cohort of 18,467 adults, excluding 3,347 for various criteria, yielding an analyzable cohort of 14,590, which is split into 12,837 controls (3,047 RIV4 recipients, 862 SD-IIV4 recipients, 8,878 unvaccinated) and 1,803 influenza cases (291 RIV4, 114 SD-IIV4, 1,398 unvaccinated). does not support the claim because the figure only shows participant counts by vaccination status and case/control status; it provides no data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or mismatch season performance. Note: The figure is a participant flow diagram with no immunogenicity or efficacy details; interpretation is limited to enrollment and grouping.",
