  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting participant counts for primary analyses: initial numbers in three groups (RIV4 n=3,047; SD-IIV4 n=862; Unvaccinated n=8,878), followed by subgroup counts of influenza-positive cases (RIV4 n=291; SD-IIV4 n=114; Unvaccinated n=1,398), culminating in 5,136 participants included in the primary analyses. The figure only presents cohort sizes and case counts for RIV4, SD-IIV4, and unvaccinated groups. It provides no data on breadth of immune response, cross-protection, or mismatch season effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited to participant flow data; no immunological or efficacy results are shown.",
