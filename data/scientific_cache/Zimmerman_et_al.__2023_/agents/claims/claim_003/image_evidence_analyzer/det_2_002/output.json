  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the derivation of a study cohort of adults aged \u226518 years (N=18,467), exclusions (n=3,347 for recent vaccination, unknown status, immunocompromise, or receipt of other vaccines), resulting in an analyzable cohort (N=14,590) split into controls (N=12,837) and influenza cases (N=1,803), with each group further subdivided by vaccination status: RIV4, SD-IIV4, or unvaccinated, showing only participant counts. The figure is a cohort flow diagram showing participant numbers by vaccination status and case/control classification; it does not present immunogenicity data or any evidence of broader immune responses or cross-protection, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but only shows study enrollment and group sizes without immunological or efficacy outcomes.",
