  "explanation": "A table showing vaccine effectiveness (VE%, with 95% CI) for recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) in age groups 18\u201364 years and \u226565 years across subgroups (overall, females, males, high-risk condition, no high-risk condition, and by season). The table presents VE estimates for RIV4 and SD-IIV4 but does not provide any data on antigenic matching with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Limited by absence of any antigenic match information in the table; it only reports effectiveness outcomes.",
