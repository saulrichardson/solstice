  "explanation": "A tabular summary of vaccine efficacy (VE %) with 95% confidence intervals for recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) and, in \u226565-year-olds, high-dose IIV4 plus adjuvant versus SD-IIV4, stratified by age group (18\u201364 and \u226565 years) and subgroups (overall, sex, high-risk condition, season). The table presents vaccine efficacy data and confidence intervals but contains no information on antigenic match or strain selection by WHO or FDA, therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; no antigenic match or strain composition details are shown.",
