This cohort is divided into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868), with further breakdowns showing numbers vaccinated with recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4 + Adj-IIV), and unvaccinated participants. does not support the claim because the figure only presents cohort flow and vaccination group counts, without any information on antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains.
