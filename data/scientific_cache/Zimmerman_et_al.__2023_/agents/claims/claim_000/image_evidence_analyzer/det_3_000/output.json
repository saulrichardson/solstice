  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting study cohort selection: starting with N=18,467 adults \u226518 years, excluding 3,264 for various reasons, yielding an analyzable cohort of N=15,203 divided into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868). Both groups are further broken down by vaccine type (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV) and unvaccinated. The figure solely presents cohort numbers and vaccine group breakdowns and does not provide any information on antigenic matching with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, thus it does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clear in showing only study enrollment and grouping; no antigenic match data are present.",
