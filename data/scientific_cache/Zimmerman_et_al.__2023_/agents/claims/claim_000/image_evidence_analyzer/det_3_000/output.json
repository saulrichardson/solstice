  "explanation": "Flowchart depicting a study cohort of adults \u226518 years (N=18,467) with 3,264 exclusions, yielding an analyzable cohort (N=15,203) divided into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868), each stratified by vaccine type: RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV, and unvaccinated. The figure is a participant flow diagram showing cohort composition by vaccine type and case status. It contains no data or statements about antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected strains and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to the provided flowchart; no antigenic or strain-matching information is present.",
