  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) percentages for RIV4 (Flublok) and standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) compared to no vaccination, and the relative VE of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 across various subgroups (overall, sex, age, risk status) and seasons (2018\u20132019, 2019\u20132020). The table presents vaccine effectiveness data and relative effectiveness comparisons between Flublok (RIV4) and standard-dose IIV4. It does not contain any information on antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited by the scope of the table, which focuses solely on effectiveness metrics and lacks any antigenic match or strain selection details.",
