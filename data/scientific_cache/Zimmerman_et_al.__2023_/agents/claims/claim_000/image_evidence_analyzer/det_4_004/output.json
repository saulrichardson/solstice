  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of RIV4 (Flublok) and standard-dose IIV4 against medically attended influenza in various subgroups (overall, by sex, age groups, high-risk condition status, and influenza season), including relative VE of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 adjusted by different methods. The table presents vaccine effectiveness outcomes and relative VE comparisons but contains no information on antigenic matching or strain selection by WHO or FDA, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Table is clear and legible but does not address antigenic match or regulatory strain selection; no missing relevant sections observed.",
