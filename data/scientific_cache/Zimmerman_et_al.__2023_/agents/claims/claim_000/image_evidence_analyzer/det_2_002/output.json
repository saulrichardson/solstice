  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A participant flow chart for primary analyses showing sample sizes for three groups: recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard dose influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), and unvaccinated, with initial and analyzed numbers. The image is a study flow diagram of participant allocation and does not address antigenic matching of Flublok to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to what is visible: no data on antigenic match or strain selection are presented.",
