  "explanation": "Flowchart depicting the study population: initial cohort of adults \u226518 years (N=18,467), exclusions (n=3,347) leading to an analyzable cohort (N=14,590), divided into controls (N=12,837) and influenza cases (N=1,803), further stratified by vaccination status (RIV4, SD-IIV4, unvaccinated) with corresponding sample sizes. The figure only presents the breakdown of study participants by vaccination group and infection status; it contains no data or statements about antigenic matching of Flublok to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim.",
