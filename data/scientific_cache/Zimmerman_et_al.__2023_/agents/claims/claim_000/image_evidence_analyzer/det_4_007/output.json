  "explanation": "A table comparing vaccine effectiveness (VE) percentages and 95% confidence intervals of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), and combinations with high-dose and adjuvanted vaccines, stratified by age group (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years) and demographics. The table presents clinical effectiveness data and does not provide any information on antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to VE outcomes; no strain matching or regulatory selection details are shown.",
