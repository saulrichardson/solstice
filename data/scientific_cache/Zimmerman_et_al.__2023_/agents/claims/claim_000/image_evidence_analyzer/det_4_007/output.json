  "explanation": "A table showing baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (race, sex, influenza season, influenza case status, high-risk condition) for adults aged 18\u201364 and \u226565 years who received different influenza vaccines (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4, Adj-IV). It includes counts, percentages, and P-values comparing groups. The table presents demographic and clinical characteristics of vaccine recipients and does not include any data on antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, and therefore does not support the claim.",
