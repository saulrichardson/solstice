  "explanation": "A table presenting demographic and clinical characteristics of participants in a study (Total N=14,590) and subgroups receiving RIV4 (n=3,338) or SD-IIV4 (n=976), including race, sex, season (2018\u20132019 vs 2019\u20132020), age group (18\u201364 vs \u226565 years), influenza case status, and presence of high-risk conditions, with p-values for differences between RIV4 and SD-IIV4 groups. The table provides demographic and clinical baseline characteristics and p-values for differences between vaccine groups; it does not provide any information on antigenic matching with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited to demographics and group comparisons; no data on antigen match or strain selection are shown.",
