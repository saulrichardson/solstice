  "explanation": "Partial view of a clinical document table footnotes and text describing vaccine effectiveness (VE) and relative VE (rVE) comparisons between recombinant influenza vaccine RIV4 (Flublok) and standard dose inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIV4) in various age and risk groups. The image presents vaccine effectiveness data and subgroup analyses for Flublok versus other flu vaccines but contains no information on antigenic matching with WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The excerpt is limited to VE data and does not include any information about strain matching; full context may contain additional details not visible here.",
