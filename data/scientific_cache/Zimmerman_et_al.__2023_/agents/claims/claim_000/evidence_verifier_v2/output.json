      "original_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by stating that Flublok (RIV4) is not subject to mutations that occur in egg-based vaccines, which can alter the antigenic match to WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. This implies that Flublok maintains the intended antigenic match."

Recombinant vaccines like Flublok are manufactured without eggs and are designed to match the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains exactly, supporting the claim of identical antigenic match."
