      "relevance_explanation": "This statement directly supports the claim by indicating that Flublok (RIV4) is not affected by mutations that occur during egg-based vaccine production, which can cause antigenic mismatch. This implies that Flublok maintains the intended antigenic match with the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains."
