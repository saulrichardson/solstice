Other independent variables were age, influenza season (2018-2019 and 2019-2020), sex, race and presence of one or more high risk conditions. Adjusted VE was calculated for RIV4, SD-IIV4 and combined RIV4, high dose, egg based and adjuvanted vaccines. Relative VE (rVE) was calculated as 1 minus the ratio of adjusted VE times 100%. We conducted propensity adjustment analyses to reduce the potential impact of selection effects (i.e., confounding) on baseline characteristics. We estimated the propensity scores using the Generalized Boosted Regression Models (GBM) approach, which is a nonparametric model that allows for nonlinear relationships with a maximum number of iterations set to the default (i.e., 10,000) that minimized the balance statistics of interest.",
