      "quote": "Standard Dose Fluzone and FlucelVax. HD-IIV4 was High Dose Fluzone, RIV4 was Flublok and Adj-IV was FluAd. Other independent variables were age, influenza season (2018-2019 and 2019-2020), sex, race and presence of one or more high risk conditions. Adjusted VE was calculated for RIV4, SD-IIV4 and combined RIV4, high dose, egg based and adjuvanted vaccines. Relative VE (rVE) was calculated as 1 minus the ratio of adjusted VE times 100%. We conducted propensity adjustment analyses to reduce the potential impact of selection effects (i.e., confounding) on baseline characteristics. We estimated the propensity scores using the Generalized Boosted Regression Models (GBM) approach, which is a nonparametric model that allows for nonlinear relationships with a maximum number of iterations set to the default (i.e., 10,000) that minimized the balance statistics of interest.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly identifies RIV4 as Flublok and SD-IIV4 as including Fluarix, and describes the comparative analysis between these vaccine types, supporting the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) in the pivotal trial."

      "quote": "The total number of influenza test results among inpatients was 18,467 of which 530 were excluded because of missing vaccination information or vaccination < 14 days before illness, and 3,264 were excluded from the primary analyses because patients were immunocompromised or received enhanced vaccines other than RIV4 (n = 613), leaving 14,590 for the primary analysis (Fig. 1). Of these, 3,338 were vaccinated with RIV4 and 976 were vaccinated with SD-IIV4, with the balance of 10,276 being unvaccinated.",
