The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote explicitly states that a randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok) with standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4). This directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine. The document also clarifies elsewhere that RIV4 is Flublok and SD-IIV4 includes Fluarix, confirming the claim's accuracy.",
