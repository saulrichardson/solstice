      "quote": "Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneficiaries study [10] using retrospective data as described above, reported significant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4) against influenza related hospital encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults 50 years old, but not for adults 65 years old [11].",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that a randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok) with standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4, which includes Fluarix). The document further clarifies in the tables and footnotes that SD-IIV4 includes Fluarix. Therefore, the quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine)."

    {
      "quote": "SD-IIV4 included Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, Standard Dose Fluzone and FlucelVax. HD-IIV4 was High Dose Fluzone, RIV4 was Flublok and Adj-IV was FluAd.",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly lists the vaccine types used in the study, showing that SD-IIV4 included Fluarix (a quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) and that RIV4 was Flublok. This directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), as both vaccines were included in the comparative analysis."

      "quote": "c RIV4: Flublok. c SD-IIV4: Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, Standard Dose Flu zone and FlucelVax.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly lists Flublok as RIV4 and Fluarix as one of the SD-IIV4 vaccines. Since the study compares RIV4 (Flublok) to SD-IIV4 (which includes Fluarix), this confirms that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) in the pivotal trial described in the document."
