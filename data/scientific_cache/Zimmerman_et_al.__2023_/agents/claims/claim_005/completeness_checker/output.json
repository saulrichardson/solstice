The Medicare beneficiaries study [10] using retrospective data as described above, reported significant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4) against influenza related hospital encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults 50 years old, but not for adults 65 years old [11].",
