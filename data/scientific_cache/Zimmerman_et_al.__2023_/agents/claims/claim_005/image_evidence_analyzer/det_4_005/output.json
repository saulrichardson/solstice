  "explanation": "A table showing vaccine effectiveness (VE, % with 95% CI) by age group (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years) for various influenza vaccines: RIV4, SD-IIV4, and in \u226565 also RIV4 + HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV. Rows include overall, females, males, high-risk condition, no high-risk condition, and by season (2018\u20132019, 2019\u20132020). The table compares RIV4 with a generic SD-IIV4 but does not name specific brands such as Flublok or Fluarix, so it does not support the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine). Note: Table lacks explicit brand names; inference of Flublok or Fluarix is not possible from this image alone.",
