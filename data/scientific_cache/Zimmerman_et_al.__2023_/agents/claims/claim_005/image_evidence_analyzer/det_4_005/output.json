  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine effectiveness (VE) percentages (with 95% confidence intervals) for RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine) versus SD-IIV4 (standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine) in adults aged 18\u201364 years and \u226565 years, with subgroup analyses by sex, risk condition, and influenza season. The \u226565 years group also includes columns for RIV4 + HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV and SD-IIV4. Evidence: The table shows a comparator labeled SD-IIV4 but does not specify the brand (e.g., Fluarix) nor indicate a pivotal trial context. The image does not support the claim because, although it compares RIV4 to a standard-dose IIV4, it does not identify Fluarix as the comparator or describe a pivotal trial against Fluarix, and therefore doesn't support the claim. Note: Analysis limited by lack of brand names and trial context in the visible table; details may be present elsewhere in the document.",
