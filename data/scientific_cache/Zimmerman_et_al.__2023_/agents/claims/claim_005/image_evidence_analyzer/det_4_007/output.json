  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of baseline characteristics for vaccine recipients aged 18\u201364 and \u226565 years, comparing those who received RIV4 (n=1,408) versus SD-IIV4 (n=763) in the younger group and SD-IIV4 (n=213), RIV4 (n=1,930), and RIV4+HD-IIV4+Adj-IIV (n=2,542) in the older group. Variables include race, sex, season, influenza case status, and high-risk condition, with associated percentages and P-values. Evidence: The table shows a comparison between RIV4 and SD-IIV4 vaccine recipients The table does not support the claim because, although it compares RIV4 versus SD-IIV4, it does not explicitly identify the vaccines as Flublok (quadrivalent) and Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose) in a pivotal trial setting, and appears to present observational baseline data rather than results from a head-to-head pivotal trial Note: The image only provides acronyms (RIV4, SD-IIV4) without naming the commercial products; context suggests observational data over two seasons, not a randomized pivotal trial",
