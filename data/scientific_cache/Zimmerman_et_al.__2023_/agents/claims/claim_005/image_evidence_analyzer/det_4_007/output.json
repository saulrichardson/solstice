  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of baseline characteristics (race, sex, influenza season, case status, high-risk condition) for adults 18\u201364 and \u226565 years old by vaccine received, listing RIV4 (n=1,408), SD-IIV4 (n=763) in the younger group and SD-IIV4 (n=213), RIV4 (n=1,930), and RIV4 + HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV (n=2,542) in the older group, with P-values. The table shows comparisons between RIV4 and a generic SD-IIV4 group but does not specify Fluarix or denote a pivotal trial design; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Brand name for SD-IIV4 and trial context are not visible; footnotes are cut off, limiting clarity.",
