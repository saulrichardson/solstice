  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table reporting vaccine effectiveness (VE, % with 95% CI) for recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), and RIV4 + high dose plus adjuvanted vaccines in two age groups (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years), compared with no vaccination. The table reports VE of RIV4 and SD-IIV4 each versus no vaccination but does not present a direct head-to-head comparison of RIV4 against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine); therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The table does not specify vaccine brand names (e.g., Fluarix), and data are presented only as VE versus no vaccination rather than as direct comparative trial results.",
