  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",

  "explanation": "Flow diagram showing study cohort of adults \u226518 years (N=18,467), exclusions leading to an analyzable cohort (N=15,203), then splitting into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868), each further subdivided by vaccine group: RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4+Adj-IV, and unvaccinated. Evidence: The figure distinguishes RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent) and SD-IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent) groups but does not specify any brand names such as Fluarix. The figure lists SD-IIV4 as the standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine comparator but does not name Fluarix specifically; therefore it does not support the claim.",
