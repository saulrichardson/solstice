  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flow diagram showing an adult study cohort (N=18,467) reduced to an analyzable cohort (N=15,203) split into controls and influenza cases, then stratified by vaccine received: recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), high-dose/adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine, or unvaccinated. Below is a note on secondary analyses including RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4, Adj-IIV, and unvaccinated participants. Evidence: Comparison groups include RIV4 and SD-IIV4 participants The image does not mention Fluarix by name nor depict a pivotal randomized trial; it shows observational cohort groups comparing generic SD-IIV4 versus RIV4 and therefore does not support the claim Note: Brand names are not specified and this appears to be an observational cohort rather than a pivotal trial",
