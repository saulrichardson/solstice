  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flowchart of an observational study cohort of adults (\u226518 years) showing initial population (N=18,467), exclusions (n=3,264), and analyzable cohort (N=15,203) split into controls (n=13,385) and influenza cases (n=1,868), with vaccination status subgroups: RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4+Adj-IV, and unvaccinated. Evidence: The figure shows a generic SD-IIV4 group but does not name Fluarix or describe a pivotal randomized comparison to RIV4. The figure does not support the claim because it only presents generic vaccine categories (RIV4 vs SD-IIV4) in an observational setting, without specifying Fluarix or demonstrating a pivotal trial comparison, and thus doesn't support the claim. Note: Brand names are not specified and the study appears observational rather than a pivotal RCT, limiting interpretation.",
