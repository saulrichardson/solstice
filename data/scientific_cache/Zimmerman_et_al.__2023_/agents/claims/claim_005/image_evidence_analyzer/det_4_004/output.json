  "explanation": "A table showing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) versus no vaccination, adjusted VE of standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) versus no vaccination, and relative VE of RIV4 compared to SD-IIV4 across overall population, subgroups (sex, age, risk condition), and by season. The table does not support the claim because it presents observational effectiveness estimates of RIV4 versus a generic SD-IIV4 comparator and does not identify Fluarix by name nor describe a pivotal randomized trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), so it doesn\u2019t support the claim. Note: Table context is limited; no brand-specific comparison or trial design details are shown.",
