  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table reporting adjusted relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) estimates (with 95% CIs) of Flublok quadrivalent (IIV4) versus pooled standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIV4) across subgroups (overall, by sex, age, high-risk condition, season). Footnotes define IIV4 as Flublok and SD-IIV4 as Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, SD Fluzone, and FluCelVax. The table does not support the claim because it presents comparative effectiveness of Flublok versus a pooled group of standard-dose vaccines (including Fluarix) in an observational setting, not a pivotal trial directly comparing Flublok quadrivalent against Fluarix quadrivalent alone. Note: Table appears to be from a real-world effectiveness analysis, not from a pivotal clinical trial; comparator vaccines are pooled, so specific head-to-head data against Fluarix cannot be determined.",
