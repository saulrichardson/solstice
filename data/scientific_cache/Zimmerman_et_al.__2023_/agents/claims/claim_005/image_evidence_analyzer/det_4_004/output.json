  "explanation": "A table listing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates for RIV4 compared to no vaccination, for standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (SD-IIV4) compared to no vaccination, and the relative VE of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 overall and by subgroup (sex, age, risk condition, season). The table compares Flublok (RIV4) to a generic standard-dose IIV4 but does not specify Fluarix or indicate that this was the pivotal trial; it does not support the claim. Note: It is possible that SD-IIV4 in this table includes Fluarix, but the table does not explicitly name Fluarix nor describe a pivotal trial context.",
