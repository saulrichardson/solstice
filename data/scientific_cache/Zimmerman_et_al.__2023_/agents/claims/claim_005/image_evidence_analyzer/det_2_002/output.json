  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flowchart depicting a test-negative observational cohort: initial study cohort (N=18,467), exclusions, analyzable cohort (N=14,590), split into controls (N=12,837) and influenza cases (N=1,803), each further divided by vaccination status into RIV4 (n=3,047 controls; n=291 cases), SD-IIV4 (n=862 controls; n=114 cases), and unvaccinated (n=8,878 controls; n=1,398 cases). Evidence: The figure shows RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 recipients in an observational cohort, but does not name Fluarix or describe a randomized pivotal trial. The image does not support the claim because it does not document a head-to-head pivotal trial of Flublok (quadrivalent) versus Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine); rather it presents an observational comparison of RIV4 and SD-IIV4 without specifying Fluarix. Note: Based solely on visible text; brand names and trial design details may be described elsewhere in the document.",
