  "explanation": "Flowchart depicting study cohort selection and allocation: 18,467 adults \u226518 years screened, 3,347 excluded for various criteria, yielding an analyzable cohort of 14,590. This cohort is split into 12,837 controls and 1,803 influenza cases. Each group is further subdivided by vaccination status into RIV4 (n=3,047 controls; n=291 cases), SD-IIV4 (n=862 controls; n=114 cases), and unvaccinated (n=8,878 controls; n=1,398 cases). does not support the claim because, although it shows comparison between RIV4 and an SD-IIV4 group, it does not specify the standard-dose vaccine as Fluarix nor indicate this was the pivotal trial against Fluarix \u2014 it simply labels the comparator as SD-IIV4. Note: Image clearly shows a flowchart of an observational cohort study, not a description of a randomized pivotal trial against Fluarix.",
