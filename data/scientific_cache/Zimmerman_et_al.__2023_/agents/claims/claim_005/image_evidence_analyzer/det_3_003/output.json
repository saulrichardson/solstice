  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Excerpt from a clinical study table showing vaccine group definitions: RIV4 (Flublok) versus SD-IIV4, with a footnote stating SD-IIV4 includes Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, standard-dose Fluzone, and FlucelVax. Evidence: Footnote indicates SD-IIV4 is a pooled group of multiple standard-dose vaccines (Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, Fluzone, FlucelVax), not Fluarix alone. The table compares Flublok (RIV4) against a composite standard-dose IIV4 group that includes Fluarix among other vaccines, but does not show a direct head-to-head evaluation solely vs. Fluarix, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Image is a partial excerpt showing footnotes and definitions; full context of the trial arms is not visible, but no specific Fluarix-only comparison is indicated.",
