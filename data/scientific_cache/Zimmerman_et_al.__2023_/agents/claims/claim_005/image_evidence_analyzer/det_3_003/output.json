  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A baseline characteristics table showing demographic and clinical measures for three groups: Total (N=14,590), Received RIV4 (n=3,338), and Received SD-IIV4 (n=976), with P-values for differences between RIV4 and SD-IIV4. The table compares recipients of RIV4 and SD-IIV4 in terms of demographic characteristics but does not mention Flublok or Fluarix by name, nor does it describe a pivotal trial comparison between Flublok (quadrivalent) and Fluarix (quadrivalent). Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Brand names and trial context are not specified in the image; the table appears to present observational or baseline data rather than results from a pivotal head-to-head trial.",
