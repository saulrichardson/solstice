  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flow chart depicting study cohort selection and allocation: initial cohort (N=18,467) with exclusions (n=3,347) yielding an analyzable cohort (N=14,590), then divided into controls (N=12,837) and influenza cases (N=1,803), each further subdivided by vaccine type (RIV4, SD-IIV4) and unvaccinated groups with corresponding sample sizes. The figure is a CONSORT-style flow diagram showing participant numbers and group assignments; it contains no data on antibody responses or comparative immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Figure content limited to cohort flow and sample sizes; no immunologic outcome measures are presented.",
