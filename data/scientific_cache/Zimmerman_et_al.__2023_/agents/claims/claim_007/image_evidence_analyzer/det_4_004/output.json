  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus no vaccination, adjusted VE of a standard-dose egg-derived quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) versus no vaccination, and relative VE of RIV4 compared to SD-IIV4 across various subgroups (overall, by sex, age group, risk status, and season) with multiple adjustment methods and 95% confidence intervals. does not support the claim because the table reports clinical vaccine effectiveness percentages rather than levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against conserved regions of HA, and provides no immunogenicity data. Note: The table is clear and legible; however, it contains only effectiveness outcomes and no antibody titers or immunological measurements.",
