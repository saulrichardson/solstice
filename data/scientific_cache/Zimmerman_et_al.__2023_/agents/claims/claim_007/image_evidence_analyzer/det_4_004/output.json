  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular summary of vaccine effectiveness percentages (with 95% confidence intervals) comparing RIV4 (Flublok) versus standard-dose IIV4 vaccines across overall population and subgroups (female sex, male sex, age groups 18\u201364 and \u226565 years, high-risk condition, no high-risk condition, and 2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020 seasons) using various adjustment methods (unadjusted, multivariable, propensity score, and inverse probability weighting). The table presents real-world vaccine effectiveness estimates and confidence intervals, not measurements of antibody levels or cross-reactivity. Therefore, it does not support the claim regarding induction of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against conserved HA regions. Note: The table is focused on clinical effectiveness outcomes; no immunogenicity or antibody response data are provided.",
