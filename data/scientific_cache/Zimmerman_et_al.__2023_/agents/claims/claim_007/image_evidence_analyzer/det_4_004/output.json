  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table reporting adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) compared to no vaccination and relative VE of RIV4 versus standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent vaccine (SD-IIV4) across various subgroups (overall, by sex, age group, risk status, influenza season) with different adjustment methods (a priori variables, propensity score, inverse probability weighting). The table presents clinical vaccine effectiveness outcomes and does not include any measurements of antibody levels, cross-reactivity, or responses against conserved regions of hemagglutinin, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear and legible but limited to effectiveness endpoints rather than immunogenicity or antibody data.",
