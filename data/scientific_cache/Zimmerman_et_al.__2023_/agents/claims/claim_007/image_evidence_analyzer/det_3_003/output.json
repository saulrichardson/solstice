  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Partial view of page 4 of a clinical document showing footnotes defining vaccine groups (RIV4: Flublok; SD-IIV4: standard egg-derived quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines) and text reporting relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 against influenza hospitalizations in different age and risk subgroups. The content presents clinical effectiveness data (rVE) comparing RIV4 and egg-derived vaccines, but contains no immunogenicity results or measurements of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against conserved HA regions. Therefore it does not support the claim. Note: The image is a partial page focusing on effectiveness outcomes; no antibody titer or epitope-specific immunogenicity data are shown.",
