  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (race, sex, season, age group, influenza case status, high-risk condition) of participants who received recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), with counts, percentages, and p-values for group differences. does not support the claim because the table only presents participant demographics and group distributions, with no data on HA antigen production methods, antibody levels, cross-reactivity, or immunogenicity outcomes. Note: The table does not include any immunogenicity or antibody response data; it is limited to baseline characteristics.",
