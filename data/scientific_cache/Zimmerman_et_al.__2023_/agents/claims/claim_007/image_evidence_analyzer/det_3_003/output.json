  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants (N=14,590) split by those who received RIV4 (recombinant influenza vaccine) and those who received SD-IIV4 (egg-derived standard-dose influenza vaccine), showing counts, percentages, and P-values for differences in race, sex, season, age group, influenza case status, and high-risk conditions. The table only reports participant demographics and does not include any data on antibody responses or immunogenicity measures related to broadly cross-reactive antibodies against conserved HA regions, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited by the fact that the table contains only baseline characteristics and no immunogenicity or antibody titer data.",
