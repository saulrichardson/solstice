  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing vaccine effectiveness (VE, % with 95% CI) for recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard dose egg-derived quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), and RIV4 plus high-dose HD-IIV4 plus adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Adj-IV), stratified by age groups 18\u201364 years and \u226565 years does not support the claim because the table presents clinical vaccine effectiveness data and does not report antibody levels or cross-reactivity induced by BEVS-derived recombinant HA versus egg-derived vaccines Note: Table includes only effectiveness outcomes, not immunogenicity or antibody response measurements",
