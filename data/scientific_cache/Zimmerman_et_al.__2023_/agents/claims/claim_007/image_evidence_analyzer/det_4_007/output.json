  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of participant characteristics stratified by age group (18\u201364 and \u226565 years) and vaccine received (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4, Adj-IV), showing counts and percentages for race, sex, influenza season, influenza case status, high-risk conditions, and associated P-values. The table only presents demographic and clinical characteristics by vaccine type and does not report antibody responses or immunogenicity data, so it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to the visible table; no immunogenicity or antibody level data are shown.",
