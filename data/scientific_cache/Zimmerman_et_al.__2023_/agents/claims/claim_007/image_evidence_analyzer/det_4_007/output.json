  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A table presenting baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (race, sex, season, influenza cases, high-risk conditions) of study participants aged 18\u201364 and \u226565 years, stratified by vaccine received (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4, Adj-IV) with P-values for group comparisons. The table does not support the claim because it only shows participant demographics and clinical characteristics by vaccine group, with no data on antibody levels, cross-reactivity, or responses to conserved HA regions\u2014therefore it does not support the claim.",
