  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing vaccine effectiveness (VE%) and 95% confidence intervals for different influenza vaccine formulations (RIV4, SD-IIV4, RIV4+HD-IIV4+Adj-IV) in adults aged 18\u201364 and \u226565 years, stratified by overall population, sex, risk condition, and influenza season. The table reports clinical vaccine effectiveness percentages and confidence intervals; it does not present any data on antibody levels, cross-reactivity, recombinant HA antigens, or comparisons between BEVS-derived and egg-derived vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Interpretation limited by focus on VE data rather than immunogenicity; image quality sufficient to confirm absence of antibody data.",
