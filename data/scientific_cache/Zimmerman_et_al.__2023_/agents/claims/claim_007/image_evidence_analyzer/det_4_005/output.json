  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Bottom portion of a page containing text on vaccine effectiveness (VE) against RT-PCR\u2013confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI), a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries, and an editorial by Flannery and Fry on evidence for policy decisions. The image text discusses VE statistics and study design for ILI and an editorial on policy, but it does not present any data on recombinant HA antigens produced via BEVS or compare antibody responses to egg-derived vaccines, so it does not support the claim Note: The image shows no table or data on immunogenicity of recombinant HA antigens; relevant content appears absent",
