  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing vaccine efficacy (VE, % with 95% CI) of recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) versus standard-dose egg-derived inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) in two age cohorts (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years), stratified by overall, sex, risk condition, and season. The table reports clinical vaccine efficacy percentages for RIV4 versus egg-derived SD-IIV4 but contains no data on antibody titers, cross-reactivity, or responses to conserved HA regions, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to interpret the efficacy values, but no immunogenicity or antibody specificity data are presented.",
