  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Partial first page of a Vaccine journal article, showing the Elsevier logo, journal title, homepage URL, and the beginning of the article title text. The image only shows the journal header and article title fragment; it does not present any data or statements about antibody responses to recombinant HA antigens versus egg-derived vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited information is visible; no figures or data are present in this image.",
