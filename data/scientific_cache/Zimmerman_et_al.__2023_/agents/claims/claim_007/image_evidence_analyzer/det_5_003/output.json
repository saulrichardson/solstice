  "explanation": "A very narrow image showing only the vertical title 'Table 5' on a blank background; no other table contents or data are visible. does not support the claim because the image does not contain any data or information regarding recombinant BEVS-derived HA antigens or comparative antibody responses versus egg-derived vaccines.
