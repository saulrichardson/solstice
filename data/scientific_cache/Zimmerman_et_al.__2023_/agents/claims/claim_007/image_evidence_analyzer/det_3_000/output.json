  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flowchart detailing the selection of a study cohort (age \u226518 years, N=18,467), exclusions leading to an analyzable cohort (N=15,203), and subdivision into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868), with further breakdown by vaccine type (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4+Adj-IV, unvaccinated). The figure only presents cohort flow and sample sizes by vaccine type; it does not show antibody measurements or comparisons of broadly cross-reactive antibody levels, so it does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody data are shown in this flowchart.",
