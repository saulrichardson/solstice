  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the study cohort selection: initial N=18,467 adults (\u226518 years) with exclusions (n=3,264) leaving an analyzable cohort of N=15,203, split into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868). Each group is further subdivided by vaccine type (RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4+Adj-IV, and unvaccinated) with respective participant counts. The figure only provides participant flow and vaccine group counts; it contains no data on antibody levels, cross-reactivity, HA regions, or comparisons between BEVS-derived and egg-derived antigens, so it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to cohort distribution; no immunogenicity or antigen production details are shown.",
