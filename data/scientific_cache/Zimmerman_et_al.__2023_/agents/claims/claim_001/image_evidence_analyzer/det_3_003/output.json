  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Partial table and accompanying text from a clinical document showing vaccine effectiveness (VE) and relative VE (rVE) comparisons of RIV4 (Flublok) versus standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIV4) in different age and risk subgroups, along with footnotes defining vaccine abbreviations. The table provides relative effectiveness data for RIV4 (Flublok) versus standard-dose IIV4 but includes no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or its linkage to immunogenicity, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Image shows only VE and rVE data; no antigen content or immunogenicity measures are presented.",
