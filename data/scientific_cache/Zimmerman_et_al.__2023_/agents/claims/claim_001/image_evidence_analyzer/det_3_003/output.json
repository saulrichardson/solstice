  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants (total N, number receiving RIV4 [recombinant influenza vaccine quadrivalent] vs SD-IIV4 [standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent]), including race, sex, season, age group, influenza case status, and high-risk condition, with p-values for group differences. The table provides participant demographics and influenza case counts without any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity measures; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Table focuses on baseline characteristics and case outcomes; no HA content or immunogenicity data are shown.",
