  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of RIV4 (Flublok) versus no vaccination and versus standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), showing overall and subgroup VE estimates and relative VE of RIV4 compared to SD-IIV4 adjusted by various methods (a priori variables, propensity score, IPW) across sex, age groups, risk status, and seasons. The table presents comparative vaccine effectiveness data but does not provide any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity measures. It therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to the visible table; antigen dose and immunogenicity data are not shown in this excerpt.",
