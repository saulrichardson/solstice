  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok) versus no vaccination, standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) versus no vaccination, and relative VE of RIV4 compared to SD-IIV4 across subgroups (overall, by sex, age group, risk condition, and season). The table reports comparative vaccine effectiveness data but does not provide any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or the 3\u00d7 HA dose of Flublok, so it does not support the claim Note: Analysis limited by table content focused solely on VE outcomes without antigen dose or immunogenicity details",
