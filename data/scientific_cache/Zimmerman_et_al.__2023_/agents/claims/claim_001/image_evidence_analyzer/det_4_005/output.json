  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of vaccine effectiveness (VE, % with 95% CI) by age group (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years) and subgroups (overall, sex, risk condition, season) for RIV4, SD-IIV4, and in older adults also HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV. The table presents real-world VE estimates and does not include any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or direct immunogenicity measurements. Therefore, it does not support the claim about Flublok containing 3\u00d7 the HA antigen or that this higher dose has been linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose vaccines. Note: The table is clear and legible, but only reports effectiveness, not antigen dose or immunogenicity endpoints.",
