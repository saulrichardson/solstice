  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Partial page text showing retrospective cohort and vaccine effectiveness estimates against RT-PCR and culture-positive influenza-like illness in different age groups, with references to studies by Izurieta et al. and a 2019 editorial by Flannery and Fry. No table showing hemagglutinin antigen content is visible. does not support the claim because the visible content provides vaccine effectiveness data and study references but contains no information on HA antigen content of Flublok or comparisons to standard-dose vaccines. Note: Image is a partial page excerpt with no clear table present; HA antigen content data may be located elsewhere in the document.",
