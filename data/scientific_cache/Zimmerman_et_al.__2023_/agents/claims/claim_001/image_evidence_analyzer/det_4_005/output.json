  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing vaccine effectiveness (VE) percentages with 95% confidence intervals for recombinant influenza vaccine quadrivalent (RIV4) and standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (SD-IIV4) across two age groups (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years), with subgroups by sex, high-risk condition status, and season; the \u226565 group also includes combined RIV4 + high-dose IIV4 + adjuvanted IIV4. does not support the claim because the table presents vaccine effectiveness data and does not include any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or direct immunogenicity measures Note: Image quality is sufficient to read the VE data, but no antigen content or immunogenicity endpoints are provided",
