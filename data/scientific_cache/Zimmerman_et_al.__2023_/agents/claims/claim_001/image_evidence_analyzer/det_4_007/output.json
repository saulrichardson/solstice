  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing vaccine effectiveness (VE) percentages (with 95% confidence intervals) of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), and a combined RIV4 + high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine + adjuvanted influenza vaccine in two age groups (18\u201364 years and \u226565 years), with subgroups for overall, males, and females. This table reports clinical vaccine effectiveness data and does not provide any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or direct immunogenicity measurements; it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to visible table data; no information on antigen content or immunogenicity assays is provided.",
