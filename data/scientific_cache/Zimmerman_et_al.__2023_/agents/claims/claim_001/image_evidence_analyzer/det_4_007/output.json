  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing demographic characteristics (race, sex, season, high-risk condition) and influenza case counts among adults 18\u201364 and \u226565 years old who received different influenza vaccines (RIV4, SD-IIV4, RIV4+HD-IIV4+Adj-IIV), with sample sizes, percentages, and P-values. The table presents demographic and influenza case data by vaccine type but includes no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim.",
