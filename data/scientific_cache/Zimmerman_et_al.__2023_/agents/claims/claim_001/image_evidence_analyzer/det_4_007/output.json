  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table presenting baseline demographic characteristics (race, sex, season, influenza case status, high-risk condition) and corresponding counts and percentages for vaccine recipients aged 18\u201364 (RIV4 vs SD-IIV4) and \u226565 (SD-IIV4, RIV4, RIV4\u2009+\u2009HD-IIV4\u2009+\u2009Adj-IV), with P-values for group comparisons. The table does not support the claim because it only shows demographic and case rate comparisons between vaccine groups and contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity outcomes, so it does not support the claim.",
