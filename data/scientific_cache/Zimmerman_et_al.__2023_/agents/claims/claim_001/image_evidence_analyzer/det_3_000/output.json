  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flowchart depicting the study cohort (N=18,467 age \u226518 years), exclusions (n=3,264), resulting analyzable cohort (N=15,203) split into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868), with further breakdown of each group by vaccine type: RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4 + Adj-IV, and unvaccinated, along with their respective sample sizes. The figure only shows participant flow and group sizes by vaccine type; it does not present any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim.",
