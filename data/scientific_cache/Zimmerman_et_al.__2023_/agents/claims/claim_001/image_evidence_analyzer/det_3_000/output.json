  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the study cohort selection: initial cohort of 18,467 adults, exclusions, yielding an analyzable cohort of 15,203. This splits into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868), each further divided into recipients of RIV4, SD-IIV4, HD-IIV4 + Adj-IIV, and unvaccinated groups with respective sample sizes. The image is a participant flow diagram and does not present any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparisons of HA doses between Flublok (RIV4) and standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to cohort flow information; no content on immunogenicity or antigen amounts.",
