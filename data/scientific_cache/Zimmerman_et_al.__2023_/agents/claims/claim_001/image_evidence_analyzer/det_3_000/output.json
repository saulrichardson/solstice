  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart depicting the selection and categorization of a study cohort of adults \u226518 years (N=18,467), exclusions (n=3,264) leading to an analyzable cohort (N=15,203), which is then split into controls (N=13,385) and influenza cases (N=1,868). Each group is further divided by vaccine type: recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4), high-dose or adjuvanted IIV4 (HD-IIV4 + Adj-IIV), and unvaccinated. The figure is a study cohort flowchart showing participant counts by vaccine group and does not present any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: None",
