  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart showing the derivation of a study cohort of adults (N=18,467) with exclusions leading to an analyzable cohort (N=14,590), then stratified into controls (N=12,837) and influenza cases (N=1,803), each further subdivided into recipients of RIV4, SD-IIV4, or unvaccinated groups with corresponding sample sizes. The figure presents cohort selection and group sizes but does not provide any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity comparisons; it does not support the claim. Note: No data on HA antigen amounts or immunogenicity endpoints are shown; the figure is purely a flowchart of participant numbers.",
