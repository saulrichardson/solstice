  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flowchart diagram showing the number of participants in primary analyses by vaccine group: recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) with n=3,047 (and a subset n=291), standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) with n=862 (and subset n=114), and unvaccinated with n=8,878 (and subset n=1,398). The figure only presents participant enrollment counts by vaccine group and does not include any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity comparisons; it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and fully visible, but it contains no data on HA antigen quantities or immunogenicity outcomes.",
