  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",

  "explanation": "Flowchart showing the study cohort of adults \u226518 years (N=18,467), exclusions leading to an analyzable cohort (N=14,590), then splitting into controls (N=12,837) and influenza cases (N=1,803), with each arm further subdivided by vaccine type (RIV4, SD-IIV4, Unvaccinated) and corresponding subject counts. The flowchart only details participant numbers and group assignments; it contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative dosages, so it does not support the claim.
