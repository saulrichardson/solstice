      "quote": "Flublok induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 for all comparisons). The proportion of Flublok recipients with post vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99 5, 97% for the H3 component.",

      "quote": "More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9]. In the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults and adults 65 and older [3-5].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote references prior studies and the current study, indicating that the recombinant (higher-dose) vaccine produces antibody responses at least similar to, and in some cases more robust than, those seen with standard egg-based vaccines."

      "quote": "Flublok induced serum HAI antibody responses to all three vaccine components in the majority of recipients, and the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for response rate exceeded the US FDA criteria for licensure for all three components (lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for response rate >40% and lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for HAI titer of 1:40 or greater >70%) [2]. Although we did not attempt to verify vaccine histories by review of medical records, significant differences in both the frequency and the magnitude of the HAI response were shown when comparing the immune response between subjects with self reported previous vaccination.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote demonstrates that the recombinant vaccine (Flublok) not only met but exceeded regulatory criteria for antibody response, and that the magnitude of the antibody response was significant, supporting the claim of a robust antibody response."
