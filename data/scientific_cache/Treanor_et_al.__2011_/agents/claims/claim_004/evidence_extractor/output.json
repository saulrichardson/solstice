      "quote": "Flublok induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 for all comparisons). The proportion of Flublok recipients with post vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99 5, 97% for the H3 component.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that the higher-dose recombinant (Flublok) vaccine induced substantially higher antibody titers compared to placebo, supporting the claim that it can induce a more robust antibody response."

      "quote": "More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived influenza vaccines.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that the recombinant vaccine produces antibody responses at least as strong as those from standard egg-based vaccines, supporting the claim of a robust immune response."

      "quote": "Flublok induced serum HAI antibody responses to all three vaccine components in the majority of recipients, and the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for response rate exceeded the US FDA criteria for licensure for all three components (lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for response rate >40% and lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for HAI titer of 1:40 or greater >70%) [2].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote demonstrates that the recombinant vaccine (Flublok) not only induces strong antibody responses but also meets or exceeds regulatory thresholds, supporting the claim of a robust response."

      "quote": "The vaccine (Flublok) used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived influenza vaccines.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote specifies the higher dose (45 mcg per component) of the recombinant vaccine and affirms that it produces antibody responses comparable to standard egg-based vaccines, supporting the claim."
