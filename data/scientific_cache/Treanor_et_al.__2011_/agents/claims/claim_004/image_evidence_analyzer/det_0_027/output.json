The image contains only publication metadata and keywords, with no experimental data or comparisons of antibody responses between higher-dose recombinant and standard-dose egg-based vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim Note: Limited information \u2013 only metadata is visible, no results or figures to evaluate",
