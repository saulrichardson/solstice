  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partially visible figure from the first page of a clinical document showing introduction text about egg-based influenza vaccine production drawbacks, partial study results mentioning FluBlok recipients, and author/contact information and clinical trial identifier. The image does not support the claim because it contains only background information and incomplete results without any direct data comparing antibody responses between higher-dose recombinant and standard-dose egg-based vaccines, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Image is partially cut off and low resolution; detailed immunogenicity data are not visible.",
