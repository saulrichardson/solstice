  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two panels of cumulative incidence curves (red solid line and blue dashed line) plotted against CDC-ILI date from January to April 2008. The y-axis shows a rising cumulative proportion (log scale) and the x-axis shows calendar date. The red curve rises earlier and reaches a higher plateau than the blue curve in both panels. The figure shows clinical incidence curves over time and does not present antibody response or immunogenicity data comparing a high-dose recombinant vaccine to a standard egg-based vaccine, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Axes and curve annotations are not fully labeled with vaccine types or immunogenicity endpoints; interpretation limited by lack of antibody titer data.",
