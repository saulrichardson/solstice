  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two Kaplan\u2013Meier plots showing cumulative incidence of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) for influenza A (top) and influenza B (bottom) over time, comparing placebo (solid line) and FluBlok recombinant vaccine recipients (dashed line). The figure presents clinical incidence curves comparing FluBlok versus placebo and provides no data on antibody responses or comparison with egg-based standard-dose vaccines, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient but the content is limited to clinical efficacy endpoints against placebo; no immunogenicity or egg-based vaccine data are shown.",
