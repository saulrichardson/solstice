  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",

  "explanation": "Two line graphs (solid red and dashed blue) showing cumulative values on the y-axis (range ~0.0001 to ~0.02 or ~0.01) over CDC-ILI dates from January to April 2008. The top and bottom panels both contrast the red and blue curves over time. does not support the claim: the figure presents cumulative incidence curves of CDC-defined influenza-like illness over time by treatment group, not antibody titer or immunogenicity measures comparing higher-dose recombinant versus standard-dose egg-based vaccines, so it does not provide evidence on antibody responses. Note: Graph axes and group labels are low resolution and the plot shows incidence data rather than immunogenicity outcomes, limiting interpretation regarding antibody responses.",
