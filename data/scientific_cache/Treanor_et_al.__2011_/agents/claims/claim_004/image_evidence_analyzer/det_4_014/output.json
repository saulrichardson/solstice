  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing the number and percentage of influenza-positive cases (CDC-defined ILI and overall influenza-positive illness) in cohorts receiving FluBlok recombinant vaccine versus placebo, along with calculated vaccine efficacy (95% CI). This table does not support the claim because it compares a higher-dose recombinant vaccine only to placebo and reports clinical efficacy outcomes, not antibody responses or comparison to an egg-based standard-dose vaccine. It doesn't provide immunogenicity data or a direct head-to-head comparison with egg-based vaccines. Note: Analysis limited to visible data; table does not include any immunogenicity or comparative antibody titer information.",
