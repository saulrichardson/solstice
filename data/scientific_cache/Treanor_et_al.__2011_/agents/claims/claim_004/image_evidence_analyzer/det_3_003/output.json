  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean antibody titers (with 95% CI) and percent response rates to three influenza antigens (H1N1, H3N2, and B) for four groups: Placebo, FluBlok, FluBlok PV, and FluBlok NPV, with corresponding sample sizes. does not support the claim because the table only compares different recombinant vaccine formulations (FluBlok variants) against placebo and does not include any egg-based standard-dose vaccine for direct comparison. Note: Table snippet may be incomplete and does not show any egg-based vaccine data; resolution appears sufficient for group labels and values.",
