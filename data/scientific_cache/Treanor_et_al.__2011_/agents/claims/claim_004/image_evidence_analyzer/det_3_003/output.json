  "explanation": "Table showing hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers (pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean titers with 95% CIs) and percentage of responders for placebo and recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok) cohorts (overall and stratified by prior vaccination status) against three influenza strains. The table presents immunogenicity of a recombinant vaccine versus placebo but does not include an egg-based standard-dose vaccine comparator, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table is legible and complete for shown groups; absence of an egg-based vaccine arm limits direct comparison.",
