  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean antibody titers (with 95% CI) and percentage response rates for three influenza vaccine antigens (A/Solomon Island/3/2006 H1N1, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 H3N2, B/Malaysia/2506/2004) across four groups: Placebo, FluBlok, FluBlok PV, and FluBlok NPV. The table demonstrates that recombinant FluBlok formulations elicit higher antibody titers and response rates than placebo, but it contains no data on egg-based standard-dose vaccines for direct comparison, and therefore doesn't support the claim. Note: Analysis limited by the absence of an egg-based vaccine arm in the table; image appears complete and legible for the data shown.",
