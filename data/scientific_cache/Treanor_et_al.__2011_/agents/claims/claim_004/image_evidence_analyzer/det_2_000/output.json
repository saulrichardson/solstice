  "explanation": "A flowchart diagram showing enrollment of 4,648 subjects, randomization into two arms (FluBlok n=2,344 and Placebo n=2,304), discontinuations and safety population counts for each group. The figure is a CONSORT-style flow diagram of subject enrollment, randomization, discontinuation, and safety populations, and includes no antibody response or immunogenicity data to compare recombinant high-dose versus egg-based standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim.",
