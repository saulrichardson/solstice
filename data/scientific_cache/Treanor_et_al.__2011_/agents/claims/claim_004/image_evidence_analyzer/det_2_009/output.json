  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A table comparing the frequency and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of solicited adverse events (e.g., fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache) between FluBlok (N=2344) recipients and placebo (N=2304) recipients. The table presents safety (adverse event) data for FluBlok versus placebo and does not provide any immunogenicity or antibody response measurements, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but only covers adverse event frequencies; no data on antibody titers or comparisons with egg-based vaccines are shown.",
