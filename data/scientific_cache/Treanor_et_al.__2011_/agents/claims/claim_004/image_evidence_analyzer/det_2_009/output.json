  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing solicited adverse events (e.g., fever, fatigue, headache) and their severity grades in subjects receiving FluBlok vaccine versus placebo, with counts and percentages, plus footnotes on severity grading and study design details. The table presents safety/adverse event data and does not include any immunogenicity or antibody response results, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is partial and focuses on safety outcomes; no antibody titer or comparative immunogenicity data are visible.",
