  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A table listing the number and percentage of subjects reporting mild, moderate, or severe solicited adverse events (e.g., fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache) for FluBlok (recombinant vaccine; N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304). The table presents safety and reactogenicity data for FluBlok versus placebo and does not include any immunogenicity or antibody response comparisons between a higher-dose recombinant vaccine and egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible portion of table; no immunogenicity data present.",
