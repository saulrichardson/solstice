      "explanation": "Table showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody responses (geometric mean titers at Day 0 and Day 28, and seroconversion rates) in adults 18\u201349 years following vaccination with a recombinant high-dose (45 \u00b5g per strain) quadrivalent influenza vaccine versus an egg-based standard-dose (15 \u00b5g per strain) quadrivalent influenza vaccine across four influenza strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Evidence: At Day 28, the recombinant high-dose vaccine induced higher HI geometric mean titers for all four strains (e.g., 174.5 vs 134.1 for A/H3N2) and higher seroconversion rates (e.g., 79.5% vs 63.0% for A/H3N2) compared with the egg-based standard-dose vaccine. The data show consistently higher antibody titers and seroconversion rates with the higher-dose recombinant vaccine versus the egg-based standard-dose vaccine, which supports the claim",
