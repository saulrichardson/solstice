      "quote": "More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9]. In the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults and adults 65 and older [3-5].",
