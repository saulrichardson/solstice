This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences in punctuation and line breaks.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 45 mcg of each HA component per strain. While the quote does not mention the standard-dose flu vaccine content (15 mcg per strain), the explicit value of 45 mcg per strain is sufficient to substantiate that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content, as this is a well-established comparator. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim, but not the second part about immunogenicity.",

      "quote": "Flublok induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 for all comparisons). The proportion of Flublok recipients with post vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99.5), 97% for the H3 component (95% CI, 94.7%, 98.3), and 78% for the B component (95% CI, 74.0%, 82.0).",

These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9]. In the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults.",
