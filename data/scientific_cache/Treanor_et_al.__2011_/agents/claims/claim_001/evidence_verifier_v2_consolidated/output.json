The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses.",

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 45 mcg of hemagglutinin per strain, which is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, it fully supports the first part of the claim (antigen content) but does not provide evidence for the immunogenicity comparison.",
