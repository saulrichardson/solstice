  "explanation": "Table showing the number and percentage of influenza cases and vaccine efficacy (with 95% CI) among subjects receiving FluBlok (N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304) for endpoints of CDC-defined influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed influenza A and B. The table presents clinical efficacy of FluBlok versus placebo but contains no data on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparisons to standard-dose vaccines, and thus does not support the claim Note: Analysis limited to visible table; no antigen content or standard-dose comparator data present",
