  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing the number and percentage of influenza-positive cases in participants receiving FluBlok (N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304), with calculated vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence intervals for influenza-positive CDC-defined ILI and general influenza-positive illness (any, A, and B). The table provides efficacy outcomes for FluBlok versus placebo but does not present data on hemagglutinin antigen content or compare FluBlok to standard-dose flu vaccines; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Table is clear and legible; no antigen content information is provided in the presented data.",
