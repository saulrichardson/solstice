  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing the number and percentage of subjects reporting various solicited adverse events (e.g., fever, fatigue, chills, muscle pain, headache, nausea) by severity grade across treatment groups, accompanied by footnotes on severity grading and sample size justification text below. The table presents safety/adverse event data and sample size justification but contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative HA dosage; it does not support the claim. Note: Table headers are partially cut off and context is limited to safety data; no antigen content details are visible.",
