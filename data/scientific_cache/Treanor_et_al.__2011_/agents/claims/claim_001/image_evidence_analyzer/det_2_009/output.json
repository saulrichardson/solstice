  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A comparative safety table listing the number and percentage of subjects reporting solicited adverse events (mild, moderate, severe) such as fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, nausea, pain, and bruising for Flublok (N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304). The table presents safety and adverse event data and does not include any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible, but it only covers solicited adverse events and contains no antigen content or immunogenicity data.",
