  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two stacked line graphs showing cumulative incidence curves (y-axis on a logarithmic scale from 0.0001 to 0.02 for the top graph and 0.0001 to 0.01 for the bottom graph) plotted against CDC-ILI dates from January to April 2008 on the x-axes. Each graph compares two groups represented by a red solid line and a blue dashed line. The figure presents cumulative incidence of influenza-like illness over time for two groups but contains no information on Flublok, hemagglutinin antigen content, vaccine dosages, or immunogenicity measures. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Legend and context are missing; resolution prevents reading group labels. However, no HA dosage or immunogenicity data are evident.",
