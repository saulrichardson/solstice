  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two Kaplan\u2013Meier plots showing the cumulative incidence of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness for influenza A (top) and influenza B (bottom) in placebo (solid red line) and FluBlok (dashed blue line) recipients over the surveillance period (January to April 2008). Accompanying text reports the number of cases and an overall vaccine efficacy of 22.9% (95% CI, 2.2%, 39.4%) against CDC-ILI regardless of culture results. The figure presents efficacy of FluBlok versus placebo in preventing influenza-like illness but provides no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparison to standard-dose flu vaccines; it does not support the claim about 3\u00d7 HA content or greater immunogenicity relative to standard-dose vaccines. Note: The image is clear and the analysis is based solely on the displayed efficacy data; no antigen content or immunogenicity data versus standard-dose vaccines are shown.",
