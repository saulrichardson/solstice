  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two stacked line graphs showing cumulative incidence rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) plotted over CDC-ILI dates from January to April 2008. Each panel has a red solid line and a blue dashed line tracking incidence (y-axis on a log scale) over time (x-axis). does not support the claim because the figure displays ILI incidence curves over time and contains no data on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity comparisons between Flublok and standard-dose vaccines.",
