  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Excerpt of a table showing immunogenicity outcomes (pre\u2010 and post\u2010vaccination geometric mean titers and percentage responders) for placebo, Flublok overall, Flublok in previously vaccinated (PV) and not previously vaccinated (NPV) subjects, across influenza strains. The table presents antibody titers and response rates for Flublok versus placebo but does not present or compare hemagglutinin antigen content versus standard\u2010dose flu vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table headers for antigen content are not visible; based solely on visible immunogenicity data without antigen dose information.",
