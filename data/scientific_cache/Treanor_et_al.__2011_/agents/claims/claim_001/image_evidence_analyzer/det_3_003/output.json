  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular presentation of pre- and post-vaccination (day 28) geometric mean antibody titers (with 95% CI) and percentage response rates for three influenza vaccine antigens (H1N1, H3N2, and B strains) in four groups: Placebo (N=127), Flublok (N=448), Flublok PV (N=93), and Flublok NPV (N=355). The table shows immunogenicity outcomes (antibody titers and response rates) for Flublok and comparators but does not present HA antigen content or compare HA doses to standard-dose flu vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to read the data, but no information on antigen content or comparisons to standard-dose formulations is provided.",
