  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Top portion of a journal article from Vaccine (Elsevier) showing the journal title, homepage URL, and part of the article title about a trivalent recombinant hemagglutinin protein vaccine. No dosage or antigen content data is visible. The image does not support the claim because it does not present any information about Flublok\u2019s hemagglutinin antigen content or comparisons to standard-dose vaccines, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Only the header and partial article title are visible; no data on HA content or immunogenicity is shown.",
