  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT\u2010style flowchart showing 4,648 subjects enrolled and randomized: 2,344 to FluBlok and 2,304 to placebo, with numbers of discontinuations and resulting safety populations for each arm. The figure only outlines subject enrollment, randomization, discontinuations, and safety populations; it provides no data on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative immunogenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but contains only study flow information, not antigen content or immunogenicity data.",
