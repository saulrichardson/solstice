  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flow chart detailing subject participation in the study, including numbers screened, randomized, and in the safety population (n=2344 and n=2304) for the two treatment groups. does not support the claim: the figure is a participant flow chart and does not present any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity comparisons. Note: The figure contains no information on antigen dose or HA content; only participant disposition is shown.",
