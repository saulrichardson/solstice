  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT-style flow diagram showing 4,648 subjects enrolled and randomized into two groups: FluBlok (n=2,344) and Placebo (n=2,304), with details on discontinuations and resulting safety populations. does not support the claim because the figure only presents participant flow and discontinuation data; it provides no information on HA antigen content or immunogenicity comparisons. Note: The image is clear but limited to trial enrollment and safety population data; no antigen dosage or immunogenicity endpoints are shown.",
