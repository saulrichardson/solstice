  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Portion of the first page of a clinical trial report, including an Introduction section describing egg-based influenza vaccine production drawbacks, and a Results summary reporting local reaction rates and vaccine efficacy (e.g., 62.6% effective) in FluBlok recipients. The image does not support the claim: it contains background on egg-based vaccines and efficacy data but no information on the hemagglutinin antigen content of FluBlok relative to standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: Text is partially cut off and no antigen content data are visible; limited to introduction and efficacy results.",
