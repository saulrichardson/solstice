  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "document": "Treanor_et_al.__2011_",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {
      "quote": "The vaccine (Flublok) used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses.",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that Flublok contains 45 mcg of each HA component per strain in the trivalent vaccine. This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Based solely on what is stated in the document, the quote supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines."

This is three times the amount of hemagglutinin present in standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines, which contain 15 mcg of HA per strain.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, compared to 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose vaccines. While the quote does not itself mention immunogenicity, it provides the specific factual basis for the first part of the claim regarding antigen content, which is the main focus of the claim. The linkage to immunogenicity is not contradicted and is supported elsewhere in the document, but the quote itself is sufficient to substantiate the antigen content comparison."
