      "quote": "Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production for growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on the first page of the document, with only minor differences in wording due to OCR artifacts. The relevant passage is: 'Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg pro growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].' This matches the quoted content in meaning and technical detail.. The quote explicitly states that the process of growing flu vaccines in eggs 'can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains.' This directly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations (i.e., select for variants) during production, which may reduce their effectiveness if the resulting vaccine does not match circulating strains."

      "quote": "Although embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. For example, the ability to scale up egg production for growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2]. Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus expression system as previously described [9].",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 1 of the document, with only minor differences in wording and structure. The relevant passage is: 'Although embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg pro growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2]. Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus expression system as previously described [9].' The factual content and meaning are preserved, though the quote in the prompt is slightly cleaned up and condensed.. The quote directly states that the process of growing influenza viruses in eggs 'can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains.' This supports the claim that egg-based (and by extension, cell-based) vaccine production can lead to the selection of variants (mutations) that differ from circulating strains, potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness. The mention of insect cell/baculovirus systems is present, but the explicit support for the claim is strongest for egg-based systems. The quote does not contradict the claim and provides direct evidence for the possibility of mutations or changes during production that could impact effectiveness."
