      "quote": "Although embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production for growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the process of growing influenza vaccines in eggs 'can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains.' This means that mutations or changes can occur during production, potentially making the vaccine less effective against the actual circulating strains. This is exactly what the claim asserts about the potential for mutations during production reducing effectiveness."
