  "explanation": "A table comparing solicited adverse event rates (categorized as mild, moderate, or severe) between FluBlok (N=2344) and placebo (N=2304) recipients, listing events such as fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, nausea, pain, and bruising. The table presents safety and reactogenicity data for FluBlok versus placebo and contains no information on mutations arising during vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness; it does not support the claim. Note: The table is legible but only addresses adverse events, not production-related mutations or vaccine effectiveness.",
