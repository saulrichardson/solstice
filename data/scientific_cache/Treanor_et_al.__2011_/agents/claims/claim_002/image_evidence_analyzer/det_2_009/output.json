  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing solicited injection-site and systemic adverse events by severity grade (1 to 3) for subjects receiving a recombinant influenza vaccine (FluBlok) versus placebo, showing counts and percentages, with footnotes on severity grading and study sample size assumptions. The table presents safety and adverse event data for a recombinant flu vaccine compared to placebo; it does not address manufacturing processes, mutations during production, or impact on effectiveness and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Table text is clear; no mention of cell- or egg-based production or mutations.",
