  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two stacked line graphs showing cumulative measures (solid red line and dashed blue line) plotted against CDC-ILI date from early January to April 2008; y-axes are on a logarithmic scale ranging from 0.0001 to 0.02 (top) or 0.0001 to 0.01 (bottom). There are no labels indicating what the lines represent beyond color and line style. The image presents cumulative curves over time without any reference to egg- or cell-based vaccine production, mutation rates, or comparative efficacy. Therefore, it doesn't support the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines may develop mutations during production that reduce effectiveness. Note: Image lacks annotation or legend clarifying line identities; interpretation is limited by absence of contextual labels.",
