  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two Kaplan\u2013Meier plots showing cumulative incidence of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness (ILI) for influenza A (top panel) and influenza B (bottom panel) over time in placebo (solid line) and FluBlok (dashed line) recipient groups during the surveillance period. The figure presents efficacy data comparing FluBlok to placebo and does not provide any information about mutations arising in cell- or egg-based vaccine production or their potential impact on effectiveness; it does not support the claim. Note: The image content is clear enough to determine its focus on efficacy curves rather than mutation analyses; no relevant mutation data are shown.",
