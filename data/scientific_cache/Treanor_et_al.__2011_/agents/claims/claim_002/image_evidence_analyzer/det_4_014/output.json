  "explanation": "A table titled \u201cAntigen manufacturing platforms\u201d listing four vaccine platforms: Egg-based vaccines (hatch and grow in eggs; 30% of flu viruses don\u2019t grow; mutations accumulate), Cell-based vaccines (grow in mammalian cells; some mutations), Recombinant protein\u2013based vaccines (no virus needed; large-scale and quick), and mRNA/replicon platforms (no virus; self-amplifying RNA). Evidence: Under egg-based: \u201cMutations accumulate\u201d; under cell-based: \u201cSome mutations\u201d The table shows that egg- and cell-based platforms can accumulate mutations during production but does not demonstrate that these mutations reduce vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim Note: Image text is clear with no apparent quality issues",
