  "explanation": "A table showing the number and percentage of influenza cases (laboratory-confirmed CDC-ILI and illness) in subjects receiving the FluBlok vaccine versus placebo, along with calculated vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence intervals for any influenza, Influenza A, and Influenza B. does not support the claim because the table presents clinical efficacy data for a recombinant influenza vaccine versus placebo and contains no information on mutations arising during egg- or cell-based production or any impact of such mutations on vaccine effectiveness. Note: Analysis limited to visible table content; no production method or mutation data are shown.",
