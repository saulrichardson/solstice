  "explanation": "A CONSORT-style flow diagram showing 4648 subjects enrolled and randomized to receive FluBlok (n=2344) or placebo (n=2304), with details on discontinuations (withdrew consent, lost to follow-up, others) and resulting safety populations. This figure only details subject enrollment, randomization, discontinuations, and safety populations in a FluBlok versus placebo study and does not provide any information on vaccine production methods or mutations, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image focuses on trial participant flow and contains no data on cell- or egg-based vaccine manufacturing or mutation occurrence.",
