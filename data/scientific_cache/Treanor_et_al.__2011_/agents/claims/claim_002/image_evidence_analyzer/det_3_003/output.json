  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean antibody titers (with 95% CI) and percentage response rates (with 95% CI) to three influenza vaccine antigens (A/Solomon Island/3/2006 H1N1, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 H3N2, B/Malaysia/2506/2004) for four groups: placebo, FluBlok, FluBlok PV (previously vaccinated), and FluBlok NPV (not previously vaccinated). The table provides immunogenicity data for a recombinant cell-based flu vaccine (FluBlok) compared to placebo but does not include any information on mutations arising during production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and fully legible; however, it contains only antibody titer and response data without any mention of production-related mutations or comparative effectiveness implications.",
