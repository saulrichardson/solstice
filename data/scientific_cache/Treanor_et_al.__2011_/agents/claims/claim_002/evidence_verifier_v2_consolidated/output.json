The factual content and meaning are preserved, though the quote in the prompt is slightly cleaned up and condensed.. The quote directly states that the process of growing influenza viruses in eggs 'can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains.' This supports the claim that egg-based (and by extension, cell-based) vaccine production can lead to the selection of variants (mutations) that differ from circulating strains, potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness. The mention of insect cell/baculovirus systems is present, but the explicit support for the claim is strongest for egg-based systems. The quote does not contradict the claim and provides direct evidence for the possibility of mutations or changes during production that could impact effectiveness.",
