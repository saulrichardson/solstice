      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that the genes used for Flublok were cloned from the same CDC-derived vaccine seed viruses as those used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccines for that year. Since the CDC selects seed viruses based on WHO and FDA recommendations, this directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. The quote provides specific, direct evidence for the claim, without requiring inference beyond what is stated.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor formatting and OCR differences: 'Genes were cloned into baculo virus using RT-PCR from the same Cd ce rived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed nactivated influenza vaccine for that year.' This is semantically equivalent to the provided quote, with 'Cd ce rived' being a split OCR version of 'CDC derived', and 'baculo virus' for 'baculovirus'.",

The quote provides specific, direct evidence for the claim, without requiring inference beyond what is stated.",
