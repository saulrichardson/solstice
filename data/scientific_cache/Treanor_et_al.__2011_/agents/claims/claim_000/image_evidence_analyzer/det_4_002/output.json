  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two Kaplan\u2013Meier plots showing the cumulative incidence of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness due to influenza A (top panel) and influenza B (bottom panel) over time in placebo (solid red line) versus FluBlok (dashed blue line) recipients, accompanied by caption and accompanying text reporting case counts, percentages, and vaccine efficacy estimates. The figure presents clinical incidence curves and efficacy outcomes but contains no data or statements about antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image quality is sufficient to confirm the content is clinical incidence data; antigenic match information is absent.",
