  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two time-series plots (one above the other) showing cumulative incidence (vertical axis values from 0.0001 to ~0.02 for the top panel and to ~0.01 for the bottom) over CDC-ILI dates from January to April 2008. Each plot has a solid red line and a dashed blue line but lacks detailed legends or labels identifying vaccine types or antigenic strains. The figure presents temporal incidence curves without any reference to Flublok, WHO or FDA strain selections, or antigenic matching data, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image quality is limited and no legends are visible; however, no information on antigenic match is apparent.",
