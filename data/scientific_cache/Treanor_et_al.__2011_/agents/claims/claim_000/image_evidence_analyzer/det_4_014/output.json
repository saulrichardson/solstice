  "explanation": "A table showing the number and percentage of influenza cases in subjects receiving FluBlok versus placebo and the corresponding vaccine efficacy (with 95% CIs) for endpoints: influenza-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness and influenza-positive illness, broken down by any influenza, influenza A, and influenza B. The table reports case counts and vaccine efficacy estimates but does not include any information on antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete but contains no data on antigenic matching.",
