  "explanation": "A table summarizing influenza vaccine efficacy data comparing FluBlok (N=2344) to placebo (N=2304). It lists the number and percentage of influenza-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) cases and influenza-positive illness cases for any influenza, influenza A, and influenza B, along with calculated vaccine efficacy percentages and 95% confidence intervals. The table presents clinical efficacy outcomes and does not include any information about antigenic matching processes or confirm that FluBlok uses WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim.",
