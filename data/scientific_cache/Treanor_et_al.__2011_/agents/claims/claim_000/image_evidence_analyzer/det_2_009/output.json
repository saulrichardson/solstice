  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

  "explanation": "A table showing solicited systemic adverse events (e.g., fever, fatigue, shivering, joint pain, muscle pain, headache, nausea, pain, bruising) classified by severity (mild, moderate, severe) for subjects receiving Flublok (N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304). The table presents safety data on adverse events and does not include any information about antigenic matching or WHO/FDA strain selection, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is legible and clearly limited to safety endpoints; no antigenic match data are present.",
