  "explanation": "A table presenting the number and percentage of subjects reporting mild, moderate, or severe solicited adverse events (e.g., fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache) in the Flublok (N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304) groups. The table presents reactogenicity and safety data, not antigenic match information, and therefore does not support the claim.
