  "explanation": "A section of the article\u2019s metadata including article history (received, revised, accepted dates, online availability) and keywords (Influenza vaccine; Baculovirus expression; Recombinant protein; Clinical trials). The image contains only publication details and keywords and provides no data on antigenic matching of Flublok to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The page is article metadata, not a figure or data table, so it offers no relevant evidence regarding antigenic match.",
