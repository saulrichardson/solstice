  "explanation": "A table summarizing pre- and post-vaccination hemagglutination inhibition geometric mean titers (with 95% CIs) and percent response rates for placebo, Flublok overall, Flublok previously vaccinated (PV), and Flublok not previously vaccinated (NPV) groups across influenza A(H1), A(H3), and B strains, followed by footnotes defining response and vaccination status. does not support the claim because the table reports immunogenicity endpoints (titers and seroconversion rates) and does not address antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains Note: The table is partially cropped but the visible content clearly focuses on serologic responses rather than strain matching.",
