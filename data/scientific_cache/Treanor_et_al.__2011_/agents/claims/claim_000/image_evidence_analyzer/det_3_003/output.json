  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing pre- and post-vaccination (day 0 and day 28) geometric mean antibody titers (with 95% CI) and percentage response rates to three influenza vaccine antigens (A/Solomon Island/3/2006 H1N1, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 H3N2, B/Malaysia/2506/2004) for four groups: Placebo, Flublok, Flublok PV, and Flublok NPV. The table presents immunogenicity data (antibody titers and response rates) to specified influenza strains but does not address or demonstrate that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image quality and table content are clear; however, no information on antigenic matching processes or regulatory strain selection is provided.",
