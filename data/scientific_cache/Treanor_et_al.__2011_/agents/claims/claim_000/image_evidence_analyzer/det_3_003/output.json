  "explanation": "Table showing pre- (day 0) and post-vaccination (day 28) geometric mean antibody titers (with 95% CIs) and percentage response rates against three influenza vaccine antigens (A/Solomon Island/3/2006 H1N1, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 H3N2, B/Malaysia/2506/2004) for placebo and three Flublok formulations (standard, PV, NPV). The table reports immunogenicity data (antibody titers and response rates) for specific viral strains but does not present any information about antigenic matching processes or confirmation that Flublok uses strains identical to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear but limited to immunogenicity; no antigenic match data are provided.",
