  "explanation": "A CONSORT-style flow diagram showing the number of subjects enrolled (n=4648), randomized to either FluBlok (n=2344) or placebo (n=2304), with discontinuation details and resulting safety populations. The figure only outlines participant enrollment, randomization, discontinuations, and safety populations; it does not present any data or statements about antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for its intended purpose; there is no relevant antigenic or strain matching information present.",
