      "quote": "Two recently published studies have evaluated egg grown inactivated vaccines in healthy adults using a placebo controlled design during the 2007-2008 influenza season. In one study, conducted primarily in Europe, the overall efficacy of egg grown inactivated vaccine against culture confirmed illness was 63%, and the lower 95% CI was 46.7% [18]. The predominant influenza A isolates in that study were H1N1 viruses, which were mostly vaccine like.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote references comparative studies of egg-based inactivated vaccines (such as Fluarix) in healthy adults during the same influenza season as the pivotal Flublok trial, establishing the context for head-to-head evaluation."

      "quote": "Because of the difficulty in conducting placebo controlled studies of influenza vaccine especially as the target groups for vaccination have expanded, several recent assessments of influenza vaccine effectiveness have utilized a test negative, case control design. Estimates of overall inactivated vaccine protective efficacy during the 2005-2006 influenza season predominated by influenza B viruses and with overall low attack rates [20], and 49.3% over two seasons, 2005-2007 with most cases due to antigenically variant viruses [21].",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote discusses the use of inactivated influenza vaccines (such as Fluarix) as comparators in recent vaccine efficacy studies, supporting the claim that Flublok was evaluated against a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine."
