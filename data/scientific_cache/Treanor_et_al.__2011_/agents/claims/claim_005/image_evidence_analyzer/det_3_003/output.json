  "explanation": "A table listing pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean antibody titers (with 95% CI) and response rates (with 95% CI) against three influenza antigens (A/Solomon Island/3/2006 H1N1, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 H3N2, B/Malaysia/2506/2004) for four groups: Placebo (N=127), FluBlok (N=448), FluBlok PV (N=93), and FluBlok NPV (N=355). The table compares FluBlok formulations only to placebo and does not include any data for Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), so it does not support the claim Note: Table appears complete for the listed groups; no mention of Fluarix comparator is evident",
