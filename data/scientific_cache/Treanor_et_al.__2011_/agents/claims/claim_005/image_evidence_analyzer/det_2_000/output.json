  "explanation": "A flow chart labeled Fig. 1 showing subject disposition numbers leading to safety populations (n=2344 and n=2304) and small \u2018\u2018Others\u2019\u2019 groups, without naming specific vaccine arms or comparators. The image does not support the claim because it contains only participant counts and safety population designations without any mention of Flublok or Fluarix or their comparative evaluation, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image appears to be cropped and only shows disposition numbers; no vaccine names or trial arm details are visible, limiting interpretation.",
