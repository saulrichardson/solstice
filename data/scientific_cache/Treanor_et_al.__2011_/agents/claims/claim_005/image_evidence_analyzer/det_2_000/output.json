  "explanation": "Flowchart showing a pivotal trial enrollment of 4,648 subjects randomized to FluBlok (n=2,344) or Placebo (n=2,304), with discontinuations and safety populations reported. The figure shows FluBlok was compared to placebo, not to Fluarix; therefore, it does not support the claim that FluBlok was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent). Note: Information is limited to what is visible in the flowchart; no mention of Fluarix or a quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine comparator.",
