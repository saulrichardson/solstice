The Results mention rates of local reactogenicity similar in vaccine groups, FluBlok recipients being 62.6% effective, and Conclusions refer to a trivalent vaccine. The bottom shows a ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT00539981) and author contact information. does not support the claim because the image only discusses a trivalent FluBlok vaccine and provides no information on a quadrivalent formulation or a head-to-head comparison with Fluarix quadrivalent.
