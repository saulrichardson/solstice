  "explanation": "A table listing efficacy endpoints for FluBlok (N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304), showing numbers and percentages of influenza-positive CDC-ILI and influenza-positive illness cases, with calculated vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence intervals. The table compares FluBlok to placebo and does not include any data or mention of Fluarix, so it does not support the claim that FluBlok was evaluated against Fluarix. Note: Image appears to show only FluBlok versus placebo; no comparator vaccine data are visible. If other parts of the document contain the comparison, it is not shown here.",
