  "explanation": "A table showing number and percentage of influenza cases and vaccine efficacy (95% CI) for FluBlok (N=2344) versus Placebo (N=2304) across endpoints influenza-positive CDC-ILI and influenza-positive illness, broken down by Any, Influenza A, and Influenza B. Evidence: The comparator group in the table is placebo, with no mention or data for Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine). The table presents efficacy data for FluBlok compared against placebo, not against Fluarix, and therefore does not support the claim.",
