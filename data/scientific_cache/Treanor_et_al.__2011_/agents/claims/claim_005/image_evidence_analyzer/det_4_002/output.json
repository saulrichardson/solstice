  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two vertically stacked panels showing cumulative incidence curves over CDC-ILI dates from January to April 2008. Each panel plots a solid red line and a dashed blue line on a logarithmic y-axis ranging roughly from 0.0001 to 0.02, but lacks any legend or labels identifying the groups or vaccines. The figure does not support the claim because it shows cumulative incidence curves for two unnamed groups without any reference to Flublok or Fluarix, and there is no indication that a pivotal quadrivalent Flublok trial versus Fluarix was conducted. Note: Limited by absence of legend or group identifiers; dates suggest 2008 data which predates quadrivalent Flublok, making attribution to that trial unlikely.",
