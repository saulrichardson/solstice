  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two panels of cumulative incidence curves (step plots) of CDC-defined influenza-like illness over time (dates from January to April 2008). Each panel shows a red solid line and a blue dashed line, with values on a log-scaled y-axis. There are no vaccine names or study arm labels visible in the figure. The figure does not support the claim because it does not identify Flublok (quadrivalent) or Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) or indicate that these vaccines were compared in the plotted data. Note: Legend and axis labels are low resolution and no vaccine names are legible; the figure appears to show general ILI incidence curves without specifying vaccine arms.",
