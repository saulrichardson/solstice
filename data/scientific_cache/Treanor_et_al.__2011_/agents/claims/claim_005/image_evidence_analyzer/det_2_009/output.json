  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing solicited local and systemic adverse events by severity (mild, moderate, severe) for two groups: FluBlok (N=2344) and Placebo (N=2304), with event types such as fever, fatigue, shivering, joint pain, muscle pain, headache, nausea, pain, and bruising. The table compares FluBlok to a placebo control and makes no mention of Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), so it does not support the claim. Note: The table appears clear and complete for the two arms shown; absence of any Fluarix arm is definitive for this source.",
