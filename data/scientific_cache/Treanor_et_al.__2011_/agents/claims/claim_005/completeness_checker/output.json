      "quote": "The study was conducted at 24 centers located across the United States (Appendix) during the 2007-2008 influenza season. Subjects were healthy adults aged 18-49 years inclusive, who did not belong to high priority target groups for influenza vaccination as defined by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice [10]. Women of child-bearing potential had a negative urine pregnancy test at the time of randomization. Of the 4648 enrolled subjects, 2344 were randomized to receive Flublok and 2304 were randomized to placebo.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes the pivotal trial design for Flublok, but it specifies that the comparator was placebo, not Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine). It does not support the claim that Flublok was evaluated against Fluarix in the pivotal trial."
