  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",

  "explanation": "Flow chart of subject participation in the study, showing numbers enrolled, excluded, and included in safety populations (n=2344 vs n=2304) for two study arms. The figure is a subject flow chart detailing enrollment and safety populations; it does not present any data on antibody responses or compare BEVS-derived HA with egg-derived vaccines, and thus does not support the claim.",
