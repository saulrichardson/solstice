  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT-style flow diagram showing subject enrollment (n=4648), randomization into two arms (FluBlok n=2344 and Placebo n=2304), details of discontinuations and numbers in the safety populations. The figure only depicts participant flow and group sizes for FluBlok versus placebo and does not present any immunogenicity data or antibody levels. Therefore, it does not support the claim.",
