  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT-style flow diagram showing 4,648 subjects enrolled and randomized: 2,344 to FluBlok and 2,304 to placebo. It details discontinuations (withdrew consent, lost to follow-up, others) and indicates safety population numbers identical to randomized groups. does not support the claim because the figure only shows subject enrollment, randomization, and disposition and contains no immunogenicity or antibody response data comparing BEVS-derived HA with egg-derived vaccines. Note: Limited to available image; no data on antibody levels or HA antigen production methods are presented.",
