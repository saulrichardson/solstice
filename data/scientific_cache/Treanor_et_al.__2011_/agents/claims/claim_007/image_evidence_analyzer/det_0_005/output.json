  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Partial screenshot of a Vaccine journal article header showing the Elsevier logo, the journal title and homepage URL, and a fragment of the article title (\u201c\u2026ective efficacy of a trivalent recombinant hemagglutinin protein vaccine\u2026\u201d). No figures or data are visible. The image only shows the journal header and part of the article title, with no experimental data or comparisons between BEVS-derived and egg-derived vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image contains no data or text regarding antibody levels, HA regions, or BEVS versus egg-derived vaccine comparisons; confidence in this assessment is high given the lack of relevant content.",
