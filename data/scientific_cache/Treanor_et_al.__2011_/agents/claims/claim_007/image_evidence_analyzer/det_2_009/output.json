  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table comparing the incidence and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of solicited adverse events (Any, Fever, Fatigue, Shivering, Joint pain, Muscle pain, Headache, Nausea, Pain, Bruising) in subjects receiving FluBlok (N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304). The table presents safety/reactogenicity data for a recombinant HA vaccine versus placebo and does not include any immunogenicity or antibody response measurements, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible data; table does not address antibody levels or comparisons with egg-derived vaccines.",
