  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table showing solicited adverse events by severity (mild, moderate, severe) in subjects receiving FluBlok (recombinant HA produced in BEVS; N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304), listing rates of fever, fatigue, shivering, joint pain, muscle pain, headache, nausea, pain, bruising, etc. The table presents safety and reactogenicity data (adverse event frequencies) for FluBlok versus placebo; it does not provide any immunogenicity or antibody response data, so it does not support the claim.",
