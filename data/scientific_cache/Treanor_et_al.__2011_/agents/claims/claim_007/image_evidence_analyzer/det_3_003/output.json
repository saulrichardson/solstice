  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table showing pre- and post-vaccination (day 0 and day 28) geometric mean hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers (95% CI) and percentage response rates (4-fold rise to \u22651:40) for placebo and three FluBlok vaccine formulations (FluBlok, FluBlok PV, FluBlok NPV) against A/Solomon Island/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004. The table does not compare recombinant BEVS-derived HA antigens to egg-derived vaccines nor report on broadly cross-reactive antibodies to conserved HA regions; it only presents strain-specific HAI titers for FluBlok formulations versus placebo, so it does not support the claim. Note: PV and NPV formulations are not defined in the excerpt; no egg-derived vaccine comparator is shown; data limited to strain-specific HAI responses.",
