  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting immunogenicity results (hemagglutination inhibition geometric mean titers and percent responders) pre- and post-vaccination for placebo and three Flublok (recombinant HA) cohorts (overall and by prior vaccination status) against three influenza strains, with sample sizes and 95% confidence intervals. does not support the claim: the table only shows strain-specific HI titers and response rates for Flublok compared with placebo and prior vaccination groups, with no data on broadly cross-reactive antibodies against conserved HA regions or comparison to egg-derived vaccines. Note: Table only reports strain-specific HI responses and lacks any measure of cross-reactivity or conserved epitope antibody levels; no direct comparison to egg-derived vaccine is provided.",
