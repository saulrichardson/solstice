  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two time-series plots (top and bottom panels) showing cumulative incidence (y-axis: ~0.0001\u20130.02) of CDC-defined influenza-like illness over calendar dates from January to April 2008 (x-axis). Each panel compares two groups, one in a solid red line and the other in a dashed blue line, but does not display any antibody titer measurements or HA antigen cross-reactivity data. does not support the claim because the figure presents epidemiologic incidence curves of influenza-like illness over time, not measurements of broadly cross-reactive antibody levels against conserved HA regions in BEVS versus egg-derived vaccines. Note: Legend and axis labels are clear, but the absence of immunological data limits any inference about antibody responses.",
