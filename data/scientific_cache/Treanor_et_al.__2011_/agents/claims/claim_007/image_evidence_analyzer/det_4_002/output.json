  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two Kaplan\u2013Meier plots showing the cumulative incidence of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness for influenza A (top) and influenza B (bottom) over time, comparing placebo recipients (solid line) versus FluBlok (recombinant HA) recipients (dashed line). The figure displays vaccine efficacy (incidence curves) for placebo and FluBlok groups but provides no data on antibody levels or cross-reactivity against conserved HA regions, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody titer data are presented; the image shows only clinical incidence outcomes.",
