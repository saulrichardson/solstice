  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two panels each showing cumulative incidence curves over time (01/01/2008 to 04/01/2008) with a solid red line and a dashed blue line plotted against CDC-ILI dates. The y-axes show numeric rates on a logarithmic scale; no labels reference vaccines, antigens, or antibody measurements. does not support the claim because the figure depicts epidemiological ILI incidence curves and contains no data on antibody responses or comparative immunogenicity of BEVS-derived versus egg-derived HA antigens. Note: The figure is clear but unrelated to antibody titers or HA antigen comparison; no confidence issues beyond lack of relevant content.",
