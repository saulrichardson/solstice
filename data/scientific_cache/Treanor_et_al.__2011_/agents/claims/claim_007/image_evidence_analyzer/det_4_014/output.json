  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing the number and percentage of influenza-positive cases (CDC-ILI and illness) in subjects receiving FluBlok (recombinant HA vaccine, N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304), with calculated vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence intervals for any influenza, influenza A, and influenza B. does not support the claim because the table presents clinical efficacy endpoints for FluBlok versus placebo and contains no data on antibody levels, broadly cross-reactive responses, or comparisons with egg-derived vaccines. Note: The table focuses solely on clinical efficacy; no immunogenicity or cross-reactive antibody data are provided. No comparison with egg-derived vaccines is shown.",
