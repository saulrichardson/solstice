  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table showing clinical efficacy endpoints for FluBlok (recombinant HA vaccine) versus placebo: number and percentage of influenza-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) and laboratory-confirmed influenza illness cases, with calculated vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence intervals. The table reports clinical efficacy of a recombinant HA vaccine compared to placebo, without any direct comparison to egg-derived vaccines or measurement of broadly cross-reactive antibody levels against conserved HA regions, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible efficacy data; no immunogenicity or antibody assay results are provided in the image.",
