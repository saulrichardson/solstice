The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006, A/Wisconsin/67/2005, and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses.",

It supports the claim by confirming that HA is the primary antigen in the vaccine.",
