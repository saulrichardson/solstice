This explicitly supports the part of the claim regarding Flublok's HA content. While the quote does not mention the 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose influenza vaccine, it does provide the specific number for Flublok, which is the main focus of the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated.",
