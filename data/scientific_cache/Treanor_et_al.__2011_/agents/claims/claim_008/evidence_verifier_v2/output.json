      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, in the section describing the vaccine used in the study.

This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly states that the trivalent Flublok vaccine contained 45 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain. This explicitly supports the part of the claim regarding Flublok's HA content per strain. However, the quote does not mention the HA content of standard-dose influenza vaccines (15 mcg per strain), so it only directly supports the Flublok portion of the claim. Since the claim is a comparison and the quote provides one side of that comparison with explicit numbers, it genuinely supports the claim as far as the document allows.",
