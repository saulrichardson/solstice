      "quote": "The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that the trivalent Flublok vaccine contained 45 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain. This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain. However, the quote does not mention the HA content of standard-dose influenza vaccines (15 mcg per strain), so it only supports the part of the claim about Flublok's content, not the comparison. Still, it provides explicit evidence for the Flublok portion of the claim."

      "quote": "comb in ant, baculovirus expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (Flublok\u00ae). Methods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injection of saline placebo (2304 subjects), or trivalent Flublok containing 45 mcg of each rHA0 component (2344 subjects).",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that trivalent Flublok contains 45 mcg of each rHA0 component (i.e., per strain). This explicitly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain. While the quote does not mention the 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose influenza vaccine, it does provide the specific information about Flublok required by the claim."

      "explanation": "The quote directly states that the trivalent Flublok vaccine contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain, as measured by a specific assay, and lists the three strains included. This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, which is higher than the 15 mcg per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine (the latter is not mentioned in the quote, but the Flublok content is explicitly confirmed)."
