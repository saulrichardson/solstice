      "quote": "The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands 3 2006, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain, directly supporting the claim about its HA content."

      "quote": "Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDC derived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified monovalent materials indicated that hemagglutinin constitutes at least 90% of the total protein.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides context that the HA content measured is comparable to that in standard inactivated influenza vaccines, supporting the comparison between Flublok and standard-dose vaccines."

Methods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injection of saline placebo (2304 subjects), or trivalent Flublok containing 45 mcg of each rHA0 component (2344 subjects).",
