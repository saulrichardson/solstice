  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two-panel figure showing cumulative incidence curves over CDC\u2010ILI dates (January 2008 to April 2008) with a red solid line and a blue dashed line in each panel; the y-axes show incidence rates on a logarithmic scale from 0.0001 to 0.02 (top) and 0.0001 to 0.01 (bottom). The figure presents incidence curves over time for two groups but contains no data or annotations about hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited by the absence of any HA concentration information in the figure.",
