  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two Kaplan\u2013Meier plots showing cumulative incidence of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness for influenza A (top) and influenza B (bottom) in placebo (solid line) and FluBlok (dashed line) groups over time. Accompanying text reports numbers of cases, percentages of participants affected, and vaccine efficacy estimates with confidence intervals. The figure presents incidence curves and efficacy data but does not mention antigen or HA content per strain; therefore, it does not support the claim Note: Image is clear and complete for incidence data, but contains no dose or formulation information",
