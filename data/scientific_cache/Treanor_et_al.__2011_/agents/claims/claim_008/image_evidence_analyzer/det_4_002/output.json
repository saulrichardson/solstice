  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two panels of cumulative incidence curves plotting CDC-ILI rate over time from January to April 2008. In each panel, a red solid line and a blue dashed line show the proportion of participants experiencing influenza-like illness over calendar dates. does not support the claim because the figure only shows ILI incidence curves and provides no data on hemagglutinin microgram content per vaccine strain for Flublok or a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
