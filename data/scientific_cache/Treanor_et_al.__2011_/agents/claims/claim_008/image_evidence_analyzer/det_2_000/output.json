  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flow diagram showing participant enrollment (n=4648), randomization into two arms (FluBlok n=2344 and Placebo n=2304), subsequent discontinuations in each arm, and resulting safety populations. does not support the claim because the figure only presents participant flow and numbers; it contains no information about hemagglutinin (HA) microgram dosages for FluBlok or standard-dose influenza vaccines. Note: Analysis limited by the scope of the flowchart; it does not include any vaccine composition details.",
