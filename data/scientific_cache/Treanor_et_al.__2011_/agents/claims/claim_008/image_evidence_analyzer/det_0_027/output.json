  "explanation": "Page 1 of a clinical/clinical trial publication showing the end of a Results section, the beginning of an Introduction section, and footer information including ClinicalTrials.gov identifier and author contact details. No tables or data on vaccine antigen content are visible. The visible content does not include any information on HA microgram amounts per strain for Flublok or standard vaccines and therefore does not support the claim.
