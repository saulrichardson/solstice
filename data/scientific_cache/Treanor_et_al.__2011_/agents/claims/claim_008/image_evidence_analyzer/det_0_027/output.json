  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image shows the article information section, including article history (received, revised, accepted, and online publication dates) and a list of keywords related to the paper (e.g., influenza vaccine, baculovirus expression, recombinant protein, clinical trials). The image does not contain any data on HA microgram content per strain for Flublok or standard-dose influenza vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but only covers metadata and keywords; no dosage or antigen content information is present.",
