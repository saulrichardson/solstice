  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table displaying immunogenicity results: pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean titers and percent response for placebo, Flublok overall, Flublok previously vaccinated (PV), and Flublok not previously vaccinated (NPV) study arms across influenza strains. The table presents immunogenicity data and makes no reference to HA microgram content per strain, and therefore does not support the claim about 45 mcg vs 15 mcg of HA per strain. Note: Table appears focused on antibody responses; vaccine composition details are not included.",
