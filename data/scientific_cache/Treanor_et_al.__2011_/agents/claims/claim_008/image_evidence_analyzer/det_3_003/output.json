  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean antibody titers and response rates for three influenza antigens (H1N1, H3N2, and B strain) in participants receiving placebo, FluBlok, FluBlok PV, or FluBlok NP vaccines. The table presents immunogenicity data (antibody titers and response rates) and does not provide any information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to the visible table, which contains only antibody titer data and no vaccine composition details.",
