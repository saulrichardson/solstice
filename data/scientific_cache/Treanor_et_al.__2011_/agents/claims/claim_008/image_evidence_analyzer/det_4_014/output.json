  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A table listing seasonal influenza vaccines for the 2021\u20132022 season, including product name, vaccine type, route, approved age, and HA per dose for each vaccine. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) is shown with 45 mcg HA per strain (180 mcg total), whereas standard-dose egg-based and cell culture\u2013based IIV4 vaccines are listed with 15 mcg HA per strain (60 mcg total). The table explicitly shows that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose influenza vaccines, which supports the claim.",
