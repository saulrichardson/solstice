  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing the number and percentage of influenza cases in participants receiving FluBlok (N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304), with calculated vaccine efficacy (95% CI) for endpoints: influenza-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness (any, A, B) and influenza-positive illness (any, A, B). does not support the claim because the table provides clinical efficacy data and does not state antigen (HA) content per strain for FluBlok or standard-dose vaccines, so there is no direct or indirect information about mcg of HA. Note: Table is clear and legible; no dosing or HA content information is present.",
