      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in wording and formatting. The key factual content is preserved: 'Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US during the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A viruses detected in this study were H3 N2 viruses that represented substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.' This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences (e.g., line breaks, punctuation).. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that during a season with substantial antigenic mismatch (i.e., the vaccine did not match the circulating H3N2 viruses), the recombinant vaccine Flublok still provided significant protective efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition. This demonstrates cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim. The document does not explicitly attribute this to a 'broader immune response,' but it does show that the recombinant vaccine was effective even when the vaccine and circulating strains did not match, which is the core of the claim regarding cross-protection.",
