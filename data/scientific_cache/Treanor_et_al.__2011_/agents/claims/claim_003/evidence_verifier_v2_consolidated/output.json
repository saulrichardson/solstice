      "quote": "Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US during the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A viruses detected in this study were H3 N2 viruses that represented substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that during a season with substantial antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and circulating H3N2 viruses, Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) still provided significant protective efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza illness, including cases meeting the CDC-ILI definition. This demonstrates cross-protection in a mismatch season, as claimed. The quote does not directly address the mechanism (broader immune response), but it does provide direct evidence of cross-protection, which is the core of the claim.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in wording and formatting. The key factual content is preserved: 'Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US during the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A viruses detected in this study were H3 N2 viruses that represented substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.' This matches the quote to verify, with only trivial differences in punctuation and line breaks.",

      "original_relevance": "This quote directly states that the recombinant vaccine Flublok provided significant protection even when there was a substantial antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains, supporting the claim of cross-protection in a mismatch season."
