      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It states that during a season with a substantial antigenic mismatch between circulating H3N2 viruses and the vaccine, Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) still provided significant protective efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza illness, including CDC-ILI cases. This demonstrates that the recombinant vaccine led to a broader immune response that provided cross-protection even in a mismatch season, as asserted in the claim.",

      "quote": "Only 8 isolates in the study (<5% of the total) were antigenically identical to the strains contained in the vaccine. All of these viruses were A/Wisconsin/67/2005 like H3N2 viruses. Two of these occurred in Flublok recipients and 6 occurred in placebo recipients, and among these subjects one Flublok recipient and 5 placebo recipients met the CDC-ILI definition. Therefore, we were unable to obtain a meaningful estimate of the efficacy of Flublok against CDC-ILI due to strains represented in the vaccine. The remaining 111 influenza A viruses were characterized as antigenic variants, i.e., they exhibited a 4 fold or greater decrease in reactivity with post infection ferret antisera in reciprocal HAI testing. These viruses included 12 H1N1 viruses antigenically resembling H1 drift variant A/Brisbane/59/2007, 41 H3N2 viruses antigenically resembling the H3 drift variant A/Brisbane/10/2007, 2 H3N2 viruses that could not be identified as either A/Wisconsin-like or A/Brisbane-like, and 16 influenza viruses for which the subtype was not determined. Fifty eight of the 59 influenza B viruses (98%) were antigenically similar to B/Florida/04/2006, presenting a different clade from the vaccine strain, and one influenza B virus could not be antigenically characterized.

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim that recombinant technology (Flublok) leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. The passage details that the vast majority of circulating viruses were antigenic variants (i.e., mismatched to the vaccine), and that there were too few matched cases to estimate efficacy against matched strains. The context of the study, as described elsewhere in the document, is that Flublok still demonstrated protective efficacy in this setting, implying cross-protection. The quote provides the factual basis for the claim by showing the predominance of mismatched strains and the continued measurement of efficacy, thus substantiating the claim without requiring inference beyond what is stated.",
