  "explanation": "Table presenting pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean antibody titers (with 95% CI) and percentage response rates (with 95% CI) to three influenza vaccine antigens (A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 H1N1, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 H3N2, and B/Malaysia/2506/2004) for placebo and three FluBlok (recombinant HA) formulations. The table only shows immunogenicity data of recombinant FluBlok formulations against the matched vaccine strains and does not include any comparison to egg-based or other vaccines, nor does it assess responses to mismatched strains. Therefore, it does not support the claim about broader immune response or cross-protection in a mismatch season. Note: Analysis limited to a single immunogenicity table without broader context; footnotes and full study design are not visible.",
