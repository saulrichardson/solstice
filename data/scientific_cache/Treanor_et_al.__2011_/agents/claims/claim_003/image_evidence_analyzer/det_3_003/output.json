  "explanation": "A table showing pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean titers (with 95% CIs) and percentage responders (4-fold increase to \u22651:40) for three influenza strains, comparing placebo (n=127) and Flublok vaccine recipients (overall, previously vaccinated, and not previously vaccinated). The table presents immunogenicity (GMT and % responders) against specified influenza strains for recombinant vaccine versus placebo but contains no data on mismatched strains or cross-protection in a mismatch season, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Strain labels and mismatch context are not shown; no evidence of cross-strain or mismatch-season protection is present.",
