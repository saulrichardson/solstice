  "explanation": "A table showing pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean antibody titers (with 95% CI) and percentage response rates (4-fold or greater increase to 1:40 or greater) for three vaccine antigens (A/Solomon Island/3/2006 H1N1, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 H3N2, B/Malaysia/2506/2004) in four groups: placebo, FluBlok, FluBlok PV, and FluBlok NPV. The table reports immunogenicity against the vaccine strains only and does not include any heterologous or mismatched strains, so it does not support the claim that recombinant technology provides broader cross-protection in a mismatch season.",
