  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A table displaying solicited adverse events (e.g., fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache) by highest severity (mild, moderate, severe) for two groups: FluBlok (N=2344) and Placebo (N=2304), with counts and percentages for each symptom. The table presents safety/reactogenicity data rather than measures of immune response breadth or cross-protection and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Table is limited to adverse event data and does not include immunogenicity or efficacy outcomes; no information on immune response or cross-protection is available.",
