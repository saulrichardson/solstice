  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting the number and percentage of subjects experiencing solicited adverse events (e.g., fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache) by severity grade, comparing FluBlok (recombinant vaccine) versus placebo. The table shows only safety/reactogenicity data (adverse event rates) and provides no information on immune response breadth or cross-protection in mismatch seasons, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table is partially visible and focused on safety endpoints; no immunogenicity or efficacy data are shown.",
