  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Partial page of a clinical article showing results and conclusions snippets on FluBlok efficacy, followed by the Introduction section discussing egg-based vaccine production and author/contact information. The image does not support the claim because it contains only introductory text on egg-based vaccine manufacturing and brief results sections without any data or statements about recombinant technology eliciting broader immune responses or cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: The image is a partial view with no figures or detailed immunogenicity data visible, limiting ability to find relevant evidence.",
