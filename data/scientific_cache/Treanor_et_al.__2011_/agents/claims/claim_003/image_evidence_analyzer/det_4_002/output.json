  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "Two panels of time-to-event cumulative incidence curves plotted against CDC-ILI dates (January to April 2008). In each panel, a solid red line and a dashed blue line rise over time from near zero to around 0.01\u20130.02 on the vertical scale. No axis labels identify vaccine types or seasons. does not support the claim because the image shows undifferentiated cumulative incidence curves without identifying recombinant versus other vaccine technologies or indicating cross-protection in a mismatch season. There is no direct data on breadth of immune response or cross-protection shown. Note: Legend and panel titles are not visible, making it impossible to link lines to recombinant technology or mismatch season context; interpretation is therefore limited.",
