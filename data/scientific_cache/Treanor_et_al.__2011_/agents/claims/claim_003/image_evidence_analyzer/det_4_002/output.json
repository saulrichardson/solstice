  "explanation": "Two Kaplan\u2013Meier plots showing cumulative incidence of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness for influenza A (top) and influenza B (bottom) over time (January\u2013April 2008) in placebo (solid line) versus FluBlok recombinant vaccine (dashed line) recipients, with overall case counts and calculated vaccine efficacy. The figure presents incidence curves and overall vaccine efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza A and B but provides no data on breadth of immune response or cross-protection during a mismatch season, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Figure does not include immunologic or antigenic match information; context on mismatch season not visible.",
