  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing the number and percentage of influenza cases in subjects receiving the recombinant vaccine FluBlok (N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304), with calculated vaccine efficacy (95% CI) for influenza-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness and influenza-positive illness, broken down by any influenza, influenza A, and influenza B. The table presents efficacy estimates for FluBlok against matched influenza A and B strains in a given season but does not indicate performance against mismatched strains or demonstrate broader cross-protection; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: No information on strain mismatch or immunologic breadth is provided, and confidence intervals for influenza B efficacy include negative values, limiting conclusions.",
