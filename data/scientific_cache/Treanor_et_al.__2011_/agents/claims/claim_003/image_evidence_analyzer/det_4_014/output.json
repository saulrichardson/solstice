  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing clinical trial results comparing FluBlok (recombinant influenza vaccine) versus placebo. Columns list number and percentage of cases for influenza-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness (Any, Influenza A, Influenza B) and influenza-positive illness, along with calculated vaccine efficacy percentages with 95% confidence intervals. The table reports clinical efficacy percentages against overall and type-specific influenza endpoints but provides no immunogenicity data, no assessment of immune breadth, and no mention of mismatch-season cross-protection, so it does not support the claim. Note: Limited by absence of immunogenicity or mismatch-specific analysis; only clinical efficacy data are shown.",
