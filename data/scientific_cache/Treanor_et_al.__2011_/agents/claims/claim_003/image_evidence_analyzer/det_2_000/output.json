  "explanation": "A CONSORT-style flowchart showing 4,648 subjects enrolled and randomized into two arms: FluBlok (n=2,344) and placebo (n=2,304), with numbers of discontinuations and resulting safety populations for each group. The figure only outlines subject enrollment, randomization, discontinuations, and safety population sizes; it contains no immunogenicity or cross-protection data and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to a flowchart lacking immunological endpoints; no visible data on immune response breadth or mismatch season protection.",
