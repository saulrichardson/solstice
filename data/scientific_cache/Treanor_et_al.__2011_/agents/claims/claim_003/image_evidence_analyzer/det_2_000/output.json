  "explanation": "A CONSORT-style flow diagram showing 4648 subjects enrolled and randomized into two groups: FluBlok (n=2344) and placebo (n=2304). It lists discontinuations (FluBlok: 95; placebo: 93) and reasons (withdrew consent, lost to follow-up, others) and reports final safety populations (FluBlok: 2344; placebo: 2304). The figure only presents subject enrollment, randomization, discontinuations, and safety population sizes; it does not present immunogenicity or cross-protection data, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is clear and fully legible; however, no relevant immunologic data are shown.",
