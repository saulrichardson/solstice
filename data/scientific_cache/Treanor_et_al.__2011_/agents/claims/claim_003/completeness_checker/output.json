      "quote": "Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US during the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A viruses detected in this study were H3 N2 viruses that represented substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by stating that the recombinant vaccine Flublok provided significant protection even when there was a substantial antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains, indicating cross-protection due to a broader immune response."

As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in Flublok than in placebo recipients (P < .001 for all comparisons). The proportion of Flublok recipients with post vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99 5, 97% for the H3 component.",
