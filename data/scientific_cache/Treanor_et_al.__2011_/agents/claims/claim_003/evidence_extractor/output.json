      "quote": "Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US during the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A viruses detected in this study were H3 N2 viruses that represented substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by stating that the recombinant vaccine (Flublok) provided significant protection even during a season when the circulating strains were substantially mismatched to the vaccine strains, indicating cross-protection and a broader immune response."

      "relevance_explanation": "This statement affirms that recombinant technology (using insect cells) is effective for producing influenza vaccines, supporting the claim that such technology can generate a broad and effective immune response."

      "quote": "The current study provides evidence of protective efficacy of baculovirus derived HA vaccine in adults for prevention of seasonal influenza and supports that significant protection in a primed population can be obtained against influenza with a pure hemagglutinin vaccine.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by stating that the recombinant baculovirus-derived vaccine provides significant protection, which is relevant to the idea of a broader immune response and potential cross-protection."

      "quote": "Only 8 isolates in the study (<5% of the total) were antigenically identical to the strains contained in the vaccine. All of these viruses were A/Wisconsin/67/2005 like H3N2 viruses. Two of these occurred in Flublok recipients and 6 occurred in placebo recipients, and among these subjects one Flublok recipient and 5 placebo recipients met the CDC-ILI definition. Therefore, we were unable to obtain a meaningful estimate of the efficacy of Flublok against CDC-ILI due to strains represented in the vaccine. The remaining 111 influenza A viruses were characterized as antigenic variants, i.e., they exhibited a 4 fold or greater decrease in reactivity with post infection ferret antisera in reciprocal HAI testing. These viruses included 12 H1N1 viruses antigenically resembling H1 drift variant A/Brisbane/59/2007, 41 H3N2 viruses antigenically resembling the H3 drift variant A/Brisbane/10/2007, 2 H3N2 viruses that could not be identified as either A/Wisconsin-like or A/Brisbane-like, and 16 influenza viruses for which the subtype was not determined. Fifty eight of the 59 influenza B viruses (98%) were antigenically similar to B/Florida/04/2006, presenting a different clade from the vaccine strain, and one influenza B virus could not be antigenically characterized. The cumulative rates of culture confirmed influenza illness ...",
      "relevance_explanation": "This passage details that the vast majority of circulating viruses were antigenic variants (mismatched to the vaccine), yet the study still measured protective efficacy, supporting the claim that recombinant technology can provide cross-protection in mismatch seasons."
