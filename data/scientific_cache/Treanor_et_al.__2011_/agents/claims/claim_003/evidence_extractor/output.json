      "quote": "Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US during the 2007-2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A viruses detected in this study were H3 N2 viruses that represented substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even under these circumstances, Flublok had significant protective efficacy against culture confirmed influenza illness, including those meeting the CDC-ILI case definition.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by stating that the recombinant vaccine Flublok provided significant protection even when there was a substantial antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains, indicating cross-protection due to a broader immune response."

      "quote": "The current study provides evidence of protective efficacy of baculovirus derived HA vaccine in adults for prevention of seasonal influenza and supports that significant protection in a primed population can be obtained against influenza with a pure hemagglutinin vaccine.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by stating that the recombinant baculovirus-derived vaccine (Flublok) provides significant protection, which is relevant to the idea of cross-protection even in seasons with mismatched strains."
