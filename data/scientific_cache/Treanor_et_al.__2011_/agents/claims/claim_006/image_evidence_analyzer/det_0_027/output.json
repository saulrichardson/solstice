  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A section of a journal article\u2019s front matter showing article history dates (received, revised, accepted, available online) and a list of keywords: influenza vaccine; baculovirus expression; recombinant protein; clinical trials. The image does not support the claim because, while it lists \u201cbaculovirus expression\u201d and \u201crecombinant protein,\u201d it does not mention Flublok, HA expression in insect cells, or a BEVS platform, so it doesn\u2019t support the claim. Note: No direct mention of Flublok, hemagglutinin, insect cells, or BEVS; limited to generic keywords.",
