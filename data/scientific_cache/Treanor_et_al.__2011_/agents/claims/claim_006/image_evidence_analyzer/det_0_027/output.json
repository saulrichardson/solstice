  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Partial page layout showing sections of a clinical trial report: on the right, a \u2018Results\u2019 and \u2018Conclusions\u2019 summary mentioning FluBlok recipients and efficacy rates; on the left, the beginning of an \u2018Introduction\u2019 discussing egg\u2010based vaccine production and its drawbacks; at the bottom, clinical trial registration, corresponding author contact, and publication details. The image does not support the claim because it does not include any information about Flublok\u2019s production platform, recombinant HA expression, insect cells, or baculovirus expression vector system, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The visible text is truncated and largely focuses on trial results and egg\u2010based vaccine drawbacks; no production details are shown.",
