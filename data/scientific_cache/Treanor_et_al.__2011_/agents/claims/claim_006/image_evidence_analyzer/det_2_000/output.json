  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT-style flow diagram showing enrollment, randomization, treatment arms (FluBlok vs. placebo), discontinuations, reasons for withdrawal, and safety population counts. The image is a participant flow chart for a clinical trial and contains no information about manufacturing methods, recombinant HA expression, insect cells, or baculovirus expression vector systems, so it does not support the claim. Note: The text is clear and fully legible; no relevant manufacturing details are present.",
