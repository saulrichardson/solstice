  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing solicited local and systemic adverse events (e.g., fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache) within 7 days after vaccination, showing counts and percentages of mild, moderate, and severe events for Flublok (N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304). does not support the claim: the table provides safety and adverse event data but contains no information regarding Flublok\u2019s production platform or the use of a baculovirus expression vector system in insect cells. Note: The visible table is focused solely on clinical safety outcomes; there is no manufacturing or platform detail present.",
