  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing solicited local and systemic adverse events by severity (mild, moderate, severe) for FluBlok (N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304), listing events such as fever, fatigue, shivering or chills, joint pain, muscle pain, headache, nausea, pain, and bruising with counts and percentages. The table contains only safety and tolerability data and does not mention production methods or recombinant HA expression in insect cells via BEVS, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible adverse event data; manufacturing details are not present in the image.",
