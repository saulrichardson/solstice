  "explanation": "A table showing immunogenicity data (pre\u2010 and post\u2010vaccination geometric mean titers and percentage responders) for placebo, Flublok overall, previously vaccinated (PV), and not previously vaccinated (NPV) cohorts. This table presents immunogenicity outcomes and contains no information on the manufacturing process, so it does not support the claim regarding Flublok\u2019s production using a baculovirus\u2010insect cell expression system. Note: The table is limited to serologic response data and does not address production methods.",
