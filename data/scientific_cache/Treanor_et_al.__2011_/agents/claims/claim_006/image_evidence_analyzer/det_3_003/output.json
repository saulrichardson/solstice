  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing pre- and post\u2010vaccination geometric mean antibody titers (with 95% CI) and percentage response rates to influenza vaccine antigens (A/Solomon Island/3/2006 [H1N1], A/Wisconsin/67/2005 [H3N2], B/Malaysia/2506/2004) for four groups: Placebo, FluBlok, FluBlok PV, and FluBlok NPV. The table presents immunogenicity outcomes but contains no information about Flublok's production platform, insect cell expression, or baculovirus expression vector system, so it does not support the claim. Note: Text and values are legible; however, no production method details appear in the table.",
