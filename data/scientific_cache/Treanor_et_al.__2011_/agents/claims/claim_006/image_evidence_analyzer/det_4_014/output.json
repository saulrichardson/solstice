  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing the number and percentage of influenza cases in study participants receiving FluBlok (N=2344) versus placebo (N=2304). Endpoints include influenza-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness and influenza-positive illness, with breakdowns for \u2018Any\u2019, Influenza A, and Influenza B, alongside calculated vaccine efficacy percentages with 95% confidence intervals. does not support the claim because the table presents clinical efficacy data and contains no information on the Flublok production platform, insect cell expression, or use of a baculovirus expression vector system. Note: The image is clear and depicts only efficacy endpoints; no production or manufacturing details are provided.",
