  "explanation": "A table listing licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines, including columns for vaccine name, manufacturer, strain selection, manufacturing platform, presentation, and storage conditions. Evidence: For Flublok Quadrivalent: \"Recombinant HA produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)\" The table explicitly states that Flublok is produced using recombinant hemagglutinin expressed in insect cells via a baculovirus expression vector system, which supports the claim",
