  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two Kaplan\u2013Meier plots showing cumulative incidence of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) for influenza A (top plot) and influenza B (bottom plot) over time in placebo (solid line) and FluBlok (dashed line) recipient groups during the surveillance period. The image presents efficacy data (cumulative incidence curves) and does not include information on Flublok\u2019s production platform or recombinant HA expression system, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image quality is adequate for identifying data type; no production or manufacturing details are present.",
