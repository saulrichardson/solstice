  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two panels of time-to-event (cumulative incidence) curves plotted over CDC-ILI (influenza-like illness) dates from January to April 2008. Each panel shows two curves (solid red and dashed blue) rising over time on a logarithmic y-axis representing very low incidence rates (0.0001 to 0.02). does not support the claim because the figure only shows incidence curves of influenza-like illness over time and provides no information about Flublok\u2019s production method, recombinant HA expression, insect cells, or baculovirus expression vector system.",
