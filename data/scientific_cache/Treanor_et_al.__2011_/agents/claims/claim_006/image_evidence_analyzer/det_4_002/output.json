  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two time-series cumulative incidence plots (step curves) showing CDC-ILI (influenza-like illness) date on the x-axis (from early January to April 2008) and cumulative incidence on the y-axis (log scale), with one plot above the other, each comparing a solid red curve and a dashed blue curve. The image presents epidemiological incidence curves for CDC-ILI over time and contains no information about vaccine production methods, recombinant hemagglutinin expression, insect cells, or a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim.",
