  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Partial screenshot of the top of a journal article from Vaccine (Elsevier), showing the journal title, URL (www.elsevier.com/locate/vaccine), and the beginning of the article title: 'Efficacy of a trivalent recombinant hemagglutinin protein vaccine (Flublok) against influenza in healthy adults\u2026'. The image identifies Flublok as a recombinant hemagglutinin protein vaccine but does not mention the production platform or use of insect cells and a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The screenshot is partial and does not include methods or production details, limiting available information.",
