  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A journal title page header for the journal Vaccine (Elsevier), showing the publisher logo, journal name, and a small image of the journal cover along with a link to the journal homepage. The image only shows the journal header and cover information; it does not contain any details about Flublok's production platform or use of a baculovirus expression vector system in insect cells, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is limited to the journal title page header with no methodological or production details visible.",
