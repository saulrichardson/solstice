      "quote": "The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0.' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation), but all technical details and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok is produced by expressing recombinant HA in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The quote is explicit and does not require inference, so it genuinely supports the claim."

      "quote": "Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDC derived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document, with only minor formatting and OCR differences: 'Genes were cloned into baculo virus using RT-PCR from the same Cd ce rived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed nactivated influenza vaccine for that year.' This matches the quoted content in meaning and technical detail.. The quote directly describes a key step in the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS): cloning genes into baculovirus. This is consistent with the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS. The quote provides explicit evidence that the production process involves inserting genes into baculovirus, which is central to BEVS technology."

      "quote": "Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus expression system as previously described [9].",
      "explanation": "A semantically equivalent quote appears on page 2: 'The vaccine (Flublok used in this study consisted of puried hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using baculo virus expression system as previously described [9].' This matches the factual content of the quote to verify: 'Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus expression system as previously described [9].' The only difference is minor wording and the explicit mention of Flublok, but the meaning and technical content are preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok's hemagglutinin proteins are produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system, which is the core of the claim. While the quote does not use the acronym BEVS, it describes the process (expression in insect cells using baculovirus), which is what BEVS stands for. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system."

      "quote": "Among the available expression technologies, recombinant baculovirus is especially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because the rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this vector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expression of the HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus also avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live influenza viruses, and the attendant biocontainment issues that would be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines [7]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for seasonal influenza.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 6 of the document, starting with 'Among the available expression technologies, recombinant baculovirus is especially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because the rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this vector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expression of the HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus also avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live influenza viruses, and the attendant biocontainment issues that would be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines [7]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for seasonal influenza.' The content and meaning are preserved, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote explicitly states that recombinant baculovirus is used to express the HA protein in insect cells for influenza vaccine production. This directly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The quote provides both the rationale and the technical details matching the claim."

      "quote": "The current study provides evidence of protective efficacy of baculovirus derived HA vaccine in adults for prevention of seasonal influenza and supports that significant protection in a primed population can be obtained against influenza with a pure hemagglutinin vaccine.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 6 of the document, in the following form: 'The current study provides evidence of protective efficacy of baculo virus derived HA vaccine in adults for prevention of sea- sonal influenza and supports that significant protection in a primed population can be obtained against influenza with apure hemagutinin vaccine.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, 'baculo virus' instead of 'baculovirus', 'hemagutinin' instead of 'hemagglutinin'). The factual content and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly refers to the vaccine as a 'baculo virus derived HA vaccine,' which, in the context of the document, is Flublok. Earlier in the document, it is explicitly stated that Flublok is 'produced in insect cells using baculo virus expression system.' Therefore, the quote confirms that Flublok is produced using a baculovirus-based system to express hemagglutinin (HA) in insect cells, which is the essence of the claim. The quote thus genuinely supports the claim."

      "quote": "Development of influenza vaccines that do not use embryonated eggs as the substrate for vaccine production is a high priority. We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy of a recombinant, baculovirus expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (Flublok\u00ae).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document, though with minor formatting and OCR differences. The relevant passage is: 'b s t r a c tckground: Development of influenza vaccines that do not use embryonated eggs as the substrate for ccine production is ahigh priority. We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy acomb in ant, baculo virus expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (Flublok\u00ae).' This matches the factual content of the quote to verify, stating that Flublok is a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed hemagglutinin vaccine, and that it is not produced using embryonated eggs.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok is a recombinant vaccine in which hemagglutinin is expressed using a baculovirus system, and that it is developed as an alternative to egg-based production. This matches the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)."
