      "quote": "The use of recombinant DNA techniques to express proteins in cell culture has been a successful approach for generation of highly effective vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV), and baculovirus expression technology is currently used for a licensed HPV vaccine [26]. Among the available expression technologies, recombinant baculovirus is especially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because the rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this vector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expression of the HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus also avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live influenza viruses, and the attendant biocontainment issues that would be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines [7]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for seasonal influenza.",

      "quote": "Although embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production, as well as the adaptation of candidate vaccine viruses for growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2]. Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has been developed as an alternative approach.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus is an alternative to traditional egg-based influenza vaccine production, directly supporting the claim that Flublok uses a novel platform involving recombinant HA expression in insect cells with baculovirus.",
