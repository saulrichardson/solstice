      "quote": "Among the available expression technologies, recombinant baculovirus is especially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because the rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this vector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expression of the HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus also avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live influenza viruses, and the attendant biocontainment issues that would be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines [7]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for seasonal influenza.",
