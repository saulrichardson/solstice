Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose for the season and for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester if vaccine is available during those months. Updates described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP that were held on October 20, 2021; January 12, 2022; February 23, 2022; and June 22, 2022. Primary updates to this report include the following three topics: 1) the composition of 2022-23 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 2) updates to the description of influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2022-23 season, including one influenza vaccine labeling change that occurred after the publication of the 2021-22 ACIP influenza recommendations; and 3) updates to the recommendations concerning vaccination of adults aged ≥65 years. First, the composition of 2022-23 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A (H3 N2) and influenza B/Victoria lineage components. U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1 N1) pdm 09 like virus (for egg based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1 N1) pdm 09 like virus (for cell

one influenza B/Victoria lineage virus, and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus. In activated influenza vaccines (IIV4 s) recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) are expected to be available. Tri valen influenza vaccines are no longer available, but data that involve these vaccines are included for reference. Influenza vaccines might be available as early as July or August, but for most persons who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccin for the season, vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October. However, vaccination should continue afte October and throughout the season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. For most adul (particularly adults aged ≥65 years) and for pregnant persons in the first or second trimester, vaccination during July and Augus should be avoided unless there is concern that vaccination later in the season might not be possible.

During the severe 2017-18 season, notable for an unusually long duration of widespread high influenza activity throughout the United States and higher rates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations compared with recent seasons, vaccination prevented an estimated 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109 000 hospitalizations, and 8,000 deaths (14), despite an overall estimated vaccine effectiveness of 38% (62% against influenza A[H1 N1]pdm09 viruses, 22% against influenza A[H3 N2] viruses, and 50%

Introduction Influenza viruses typically circulate annually in the United States, most commonly from the late fall through the early spring. Most persons who become ill after influenza virus infection recover without serious complications or sequelae. However, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults, very young children, pregnant persons, and persons of all ages with certain chronic medical conditions (1-7). Influenza also is an important cause of missed work and school (8-10). Routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contra indications has been recommended by CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2010 (11). Vaccination provides important protection from influenza illness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors, such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages (for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine (12).

While waning of immunity after vaccination over the course of the season has been observed among all age groups (19 32, there are fewer published studies reporting results specifically among children (19 22. Moreover, children in this group might visit health care providers during the late summer months for medical examinations before the start of school. Vaccination can be considered at this time because it represents a vaccination opportunity. • Pregnant persons in the third trimester: Vaccination during July and August can be considered for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester because vaccination might reduce risk for influenza illness in their infants during the first months after birth, when they are too young to receive influenza vaccine (33 36. For pregnant persons in the first or second trimester during July and August, waiting to vaccinate until September or October is preferable, unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. Community vaccination programs should balance maximizing the likelihood of persistence of vaccine induced protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation occurs. Efforts should be structured to optimize vaccination coverage before influenza activity in the community begins. Vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for

of influenza vaccine effectiveness using the test negative design found a significant decline in effectiveness within 180 days after vaccination against influenza A (H3 N2) and influenza B but not against influenza A (H1 N1) (38). In addition to the factors observed to be associated with waning immunity across studies, observed decreases in protection might be at least in

Certain studies suggest waning occurs to a greater degree against influenza A (H3 N2) viruses than against influenza A (H1 N1) or influenza B viruses (26 27. This effect also might vary with recipient age; in certain studies, waning was more pronounced among older adults (19 23 26 30 32 and younger children (19). Relatively fewer reports include results specific to children (19 22; findings suggestive of waning have been reported in certain studies (19 21 but not others (22). Rates of decline in vaccine effectiveness also varied. A multi season (2011-12 through 2014 15 analysis from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu VE) Network found that vaccine effectiveness decreased by approximately 7% per month for influenza A (H3 N2) and influenza B and 6 11 per month for influenza A (H1 N1) pdm09 (25). Vaccine effectiveness remained greater than zero for at least 5-6 months after vaccination. In the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAI VEN during the 2015-16 through 2018-19 seasons, vaccine effectiveness against influenza associated hospitalizations declined by approximately 8%-9% per month for all adults and approximately 10 11 per month for those aged ≥65 years (32). An analysis of the 2010-11 through 2013-14 seasons noted estimated effectiveness ranging from 54% to 67% during days 0-180 post vaccination; estimated vaccine effectiveness was not significant during the period between days 181 and 365 (20). A third multi season analysis (2010-11 through 2014 15 conducted in Europe noted a decline in vaccine effectiveness to 0% at 111 days post vaccination against influenza A (H3 N2) viruses.

Although vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has already begun, might be beneficial in most influenza seasons. Providers should offer influenza vaccination to un vaccinated persons who have already become ill with influenza during the season because the vaccine might protect them against other circulating influenza viruses.

In this model, during an influenza season beginning in October and peaking in January, delaying vaccination until October resulted in more hospitalizations if >14% of persons aged ≥65 years who would have been vaccinated in August or September failed to get vaccinated. However, these predictions varied considerably with assumed timing of season onset, rate of waning immunity, and vaccine effectiveness.

Influenza Vaccination of Persons with COVID-19 Vaccination of persons who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who are in quarantine after an exposure should include multiple considerations, such as whether bringing the person into a vaccination setting could expose others to COVID-19, whether the person is acutely ill and the severity of the illness, the presence of risk factors for severe influenza illness, the likelihood of being able to vaccinate at a later date, and the desire to avoid confusing post vaccination symptoms with those of COVID-19. Usually, persons who are in quarantine or isolation should not be brought to a vaccination setting if doing so could expose others to COVID-19. For those who have moderate or severe COVID-19, vaccination should usually be deferred until they have recovered, which is consistent with ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for

Health care personnel and persons who are contacts of persons in these groups (with the exception of contacts of severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment) may receive any influenza vaccine that is otherwise indicated. Persons who care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment should not receive LAIV4.

Early vaccination (i.e., during July and August) can be considered for persons who are in the third trimester during these months if vaccine is available because this can provide protection for the infant during the first months of life when they are too young to be vaccinated. Although experience with the use of IIVs during pregnancy is substantial, data specifically reflecting administration of influenza vaccines during the first trimester are limited (see Safety of Influenza Vaccines in the supplementary Background Document). Most studies have not noted an association between influenza vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) (51 61. One observational

The adjuvant ed vaccine contains 15 µg of HA per virus, similarly to non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59. HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs against laboratory confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66 68 and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code defined (rather than laboratory confirmed outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69 79. Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza associated hospitalizations.

Randomized Studies Comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with Non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs: Prevention of Influenza associated Hospitalizations and Other Serious Events. No data are available from randomized trials evaluating prevention of laboratory confirmed influenza associated hospitalizations as a primary outcome. In a secondary analysis from a two season randomized trial of HD-IIV3 versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV3 assessing serious adverse events (SAEs) (including hospitalizations associated with laboratory confirmation of influenza performed outside of the study (82) and apost hoc analysis of pneumonia- and influenza related hospitalizations from a randomized study of HD-IIV3 versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV4 (83), there was no difference in risk for these events between the two groups (certainty level: 2, moderate). However, additional data are available from two single season, cluster randomized studies conducted among U.S. nursing homes (in which nursing homes were randomized to vaccine groups rather than individual persons) that examined prevention of pneumonia and influenza diagnostic coded hospitalizations. One such study noted a benefit of HD-IIV3

Randomized Studies Comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with Non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs: Prevention of Influenza Illnesses. Randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs against laboratory confirmed influenza illness are few in number and were conducted over few influenza seasons. HD-IIV3 was more effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or culture confirmed influenza like illness (ILI) in a two season randomized study conducted among 32 000 persons aged ≥65 years (relative efficacy: 24%; 95% CI: 10 36; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single season randomized trials of RIV versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV3 that assessed culture confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus non adjuvant ed SD-IIV4 that examined PCRconfirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged ≥65 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: −17% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate). The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over non adjuvant ed SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged ≥50 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10 47 as well i lfi d ILI h d 65

p g g ppostvaccination was similar between the co administration group and the group that received the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine alone; reactogenicity rates in the group receiving HD-IIV4 alone were lower. No SAEs were observed. Immune response was similar between the mRNA COVID-19 and co administration groups (103). Relatively limited data are available on the concomitant administration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines. Studies of live attenuated zoster vaccine and IIV3 (104) or IIV4 (105) among persons aged ≥50 years noted similar antibody responses whether the two vaccines were administered concomitantly or 4 weeks apart. In certain studies, reduced responses have been noted to 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) (106 107, tetanus antigens (108), and pertussis antigens (108) when co administered with IIV3 to adults; in most instances, the clinical significance of this is uncertain. Simultaneous administration of IIV4 and 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) to persons aged ≥65 years was associated with lower seroprotection rates to one influenza B antigen at 4-6 weeks post vaccination compared with sequential administration 2 weeks apart. Seroprotection was not significantly different between the two groups for any of the four influenza antigens at 6 months post vaccination (109). Reassuring safety profiles have been noted for simultaneous administration of IIVs with live attenuated zoster vaccine (104 105; PCV13 (106 107; PPSV23 (109 110; tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid,

y, COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines that might be more likely to cause an injection site reaction (e.g., aIIV4 or HD-IIV4) should be administered in different limbs, if possible. In an interim analysis of a study of concomitant administration of HD-IIV4 and a booster dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (administered in separate upper arm sites) compared with administration of either vaccine alone among 296 persons aged ≥65 years, overall reactogenicity up to 7 days

has been studied, and no evidence of decreased immunogen i city or safety concerns was noted (122). The immunogen i city and safety of simultaneous or sequential administration of two non alum in um adjuvant-containing vaccines have not been evaluated, and the ideal interval between such vaccines when given sequentially is not known. In the study of Shin grix and IIV4 (122), most reactogenicity symptoms resolved within 4 days. Because of the limited data on the safety of simultaneous administration of two or more vaccines containing non alum in um adjuvants and the availability of non adjuvant ed influenza vaccine options, selection of an on adjuvant ed influenza vaccine may be considered in situations in which influenza vaccine and another vaccine containing an on alum in um adjuvant are to be administered concomitantly. However, influenza vaccination should not be delayed if a specific vaccine is not available. As recommended for all vaccines, vaccines with non alum in um adjuvants should be administered at separate anatomic sites from other vaccines that are given concomitantly (42).

been noted within days 0-1 after co administration of IIV with PCV7, PCV13, or DTaP vaccines during the 2006-07 through 2010-11 seasons (114) and with PCV13 during the 2014-15 season (115). Although concerning to parents, most febrile seizures are brief and have agood prognosis (116). After considering the risks and benefits, no changes in the recommendations for administration of these vaccines were made. Surveillance of febrile seizures is ongoing through VAERS, and the VSD annual influenza safety surveillance includes monitoring for seizures after vaccinations. Studies of concomitant administration of LAIV with other vaccines are limited. Concurrent administration of LAIV3 with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccine to children was not associated with diminished immunogen i city of antigens in any of the vaccines in one study (117); diminished response to rubella was observed in another study examining co administration of LAIV3 and MMR (118). No safety concerns were noted in these studies. In recent years, several vaccines containing non alum in um adjuvants have been licensed for use in the United States for the prevention of various infectious diseases. These include AS01 B (in Shin grix, recombinant zoster subunit vaccine) (119), MF59 (in Fluad Quad rival ent [aIIV4]) (120), and cytosine phosphoguanine oli god eoxy nucleotide (in Heplisav-B, a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine) (121). Data are limited regarding co administration of these vaccines with other adjuvant ed or non adjuvant ed vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines.

aged ≥36 months, the remaining volume needed to make afull dose should be administered during the same vaccination visit or, if measuring the needed remaining volume is a challenge, administering a repeat dose at the full volume is acceptable. If the error is discovered later (after the recipient has left the vaccination setting), afull dose should be administered as soon as the recipient can return. Vaccination with a formulation approved for adult use should be counted as a single dose if inadvertently administered to a child. IIV4 s are administered intramuscularly (IM). For adults and older children, the deltoid muscle is the preferred site. Infants and younger children should be vaccinated in the an ter ola ter al thigh. Additional specific guidance regarding site selection and needle length for IM injection is provided in the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (42). One IIV4, A flu ria Quad rival ent, is licensed for IM injection via the PharmaJet Str at is jet injector for persons aged 18 through 64 years (43). Persons in this age group may receive A flu ria Quad rival ent via either needle and syringe or this specific jet injection device.
