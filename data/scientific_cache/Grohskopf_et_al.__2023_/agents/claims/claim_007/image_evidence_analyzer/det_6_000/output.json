  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing contraindications and precautions for various influenza vaccines, including egg-based inactivated vaccines (IIV and LAIV4), cell culture\u2013based inactivated vaccines (ccIIV and ccIIV4), and recombinant influenza vaccines (RIV and RIV4). Abbreviations for vaccine types and ACIP/FDA terms are listed below the table. The table only presents contraindications and precautions for different influenza vaccines and does not include any immunogenicity or antibody response data; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but contains no relevant immunogenicity or comparative antibody data.",
