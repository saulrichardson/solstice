  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table outlining recommendations (Contraindication, Precaution, or Allergist consultation) for use of egg-based IIVs/LAIV4, cell culture\u2013based vaccines (ccIIV4), and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) in individuals with a history of severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine or vaccine components. The table provides guidance on contraindications and precautions related to allergic reactions for different influenza vaccine platforms; it does not present data on antibody responses or comparative immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear, but it does not contain any immunogenicity or antibody response data relevant to the claim.",
