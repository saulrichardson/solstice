  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A decision-tree flowchart outlining influenza vaccine dosing for children: it asks whether the child received \u22652 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022. If yes, administer 1 dose of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine; if no or unknown, administer 2 doses of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine at least 4 weeks apart. The image is a vaccination dosing algorithm and contains no data on recombinant HA antigens, BEVS production, antibody levels, or comparisons with egg-derived vaccines, so it does not support the claim.",
