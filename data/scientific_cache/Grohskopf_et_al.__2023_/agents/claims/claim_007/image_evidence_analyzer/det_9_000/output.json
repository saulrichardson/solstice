  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining influenza vaccination dosing recommendations for children aged 6 months through 8 years for the 2022\u201323 season, based on whether they received prior trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine doses before July 1, 2022. does not support the claim because the figure provides dosing guidance for pediatric influenza vaccination and contains no data on antibody levels, recombinant HA antigens, BEVS production, or comparison with egg-derived vaccines. Note: No relevant immunogenicity or antibody response data are present in the image.",
