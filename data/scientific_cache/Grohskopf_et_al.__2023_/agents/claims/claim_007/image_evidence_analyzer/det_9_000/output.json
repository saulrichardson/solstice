  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining how many 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine doses a child should receive based on whether they received \u22652 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022. If yes, the child receives 1 dose of the 2022\u201323 vaccine; if no or unknown, the child receives 2 doses of the 2022\u201323 vaccine at least 4 weeks apart. The figure only provides a pediatric influenza vaccine dosing algorithm and does not present any data on recombinant HA antigens, BEVS production, or antibody responses in comparison with egg-derived vaccines, so it does not support the claim.",
