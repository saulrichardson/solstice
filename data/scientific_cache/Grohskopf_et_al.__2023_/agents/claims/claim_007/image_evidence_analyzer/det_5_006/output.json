  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing contraindications and precautions for various influenza vaccine formulations (egg-based inactivated IIV4, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4, and adjuvanted aIIV4), including history of severe allergic reactions, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, asthma, immunocompromised status, and other medical conditions. does not support the claim: the table only presents safety precautions and contraindications for different influenza vaccines and contains no data on antibody responses or comparisons of broadly cross-reactive antibody levels induced by BEVS-produced recombinant HA versus egg-derived vaccines.",
