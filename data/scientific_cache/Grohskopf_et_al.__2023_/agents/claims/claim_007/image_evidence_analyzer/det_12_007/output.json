  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing trade names and manufacturers of quadrivalent influenza vaccines with corresponding dose volumes (in mL) and HA content (in \u00b5g per vaccine virus) for children aged 6 through 35 months. This table only provides pediatric dosing information and HA quantities for various egg-derived and cell-derived influenza vaccines; it does not include any data on recombinant HA antigens, BEVS production, or antibody cross-reactivity, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete regarding dosing, but contains no immunogenicity or comparative antibody data.",
