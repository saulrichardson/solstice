  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing names of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (e.g., Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent), their manufacturers, the approved dose volume (0.25 mL or 0.5 mL) and corresponding HA content (7.5 \u00b5g or 15 \u00b5g), along with footnotes on age indications and HA abbreviation. The table presents only vaccine formulations and dosing information; it provides no data on antibody responses or comparisons between BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens and egg-derived vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim.",
