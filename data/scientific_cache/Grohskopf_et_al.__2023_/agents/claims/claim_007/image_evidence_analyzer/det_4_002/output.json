  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing licensed seasonal influenza vaccines by trade name and manufacturer, showing presentations (e.g., prefilled syringe volumes, multi-dose vial), age indications, micrograms of HA antigen per strain or virus count per dose, route of administration, and mercury content. The table provides formulation and dosing information for various influenza vaccines, including a recombinant HA vaccine, but contains no data on antibody responses or comparisons of broadly cross-reactive antibodies. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to determine that no immunogenicity or antibody data are presented in this table.",
