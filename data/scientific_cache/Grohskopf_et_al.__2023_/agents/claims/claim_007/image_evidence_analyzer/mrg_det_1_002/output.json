  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two-column layout showing the table of contents for an MMWR report on influenza vaccines (including sections like Introduction, Methods, Recommendations for the Use of Influenza Vaccines 2022\u201323, etc.) and a section describing CDC adoption of ACIP recommendations, followed by publication credits and staff listings. The image contains only the table of contents and general publication and recommendation process information; it does not present any data or statements about recombinant HA antigens, BEVS production, or antibody responses against conserved HA regions and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is clear, but the content is unrelated to antigen production or immunogenicity data.",
