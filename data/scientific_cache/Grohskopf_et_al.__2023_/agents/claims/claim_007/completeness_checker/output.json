      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) is a recombinant HA antigen produced using the BEVS (baculovirus expression vector system) platform, and that it is distinct from egg-derived vaccines, which is necessary context for comparing immunogenicity."

      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66\u201368) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code\u2013defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69\u201379). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that recombinant influenza vaccines (RIV, which are BEVS-produced) have shown a relative benefit compared to standard-dose, egg-derived inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIVs), supporting the claim of improved immunogenicity or effectiveness."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct comparative data showing that the BEVS-produced recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4) was more effective than the standard-dose, egg-derived vaccine (SD-IIV4), which supports the claim of superior immunogenicity or cross-reactivity."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that recombinant HA vaccines (RIV) contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard egg-derived vaccines, which is a key factor in their ability to induce higher levels of cross-reactive antibodies.",
