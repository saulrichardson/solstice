      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with non adjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66 68) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code defined (rather than laboratory confirmed outcomes), are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69 79). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with non adjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza associated hospitalizations.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that RIV (recombinant HA vaccine) has shown relative benefit compared with standard-dose egg-derived inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIVs), supporting the claim that recombinant HA antigens induce higher levels of protective immune responses."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct comparative data showing that RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) was more effective than standard-dose egg-derived IIV4 in preventing influenza-coded hospitalizations, supporting the claim of superior immunogenicity and cross-reactivity."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) had a measurable relative effectiveness compared to other high-dose or adjuvanted vaccines, further supporting the claim that recombinant HA antigens can induce strong, broadly cross-reactive antibody responses."
