All influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2022-23 season will be quadrivalent vaccines.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote states that all licensed influenza vaccines in the US, including Flublok, will contain antigens that are antigenically similar to those recommended by the FDA, which bases its recommendations on WHO guidance. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains."

      "quote": "For the 2022-23 season, U.S. cell culture based inactivated (ccIIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from \u2022 an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, \u2022 an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus, \u2022 an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and \u2022 an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote specifies that recombinant vaccines like Flublok (RIV4) will contain hemagglutinin (HA) antigens derived from the exact strains selected for the season, matching the WHO and FDA recommendations. This directly supports the claim of identical antigenic match."

      "quote": "Quad rivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes Flublok's (RIV4) manufacturing process, which uses genetic sequences from cell-derived influenza viruses, ensuring the HA antigens are identical to those selected for the season by regulatory authorities. This supports the claim of an identical antigenic match."

      "quote": "Recommendations for the composition of Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines are made by the World Health Organization (WHO), which organizes a consultation, usually in February of each year. Surveillance data are reviewed, and candidate vaccine viruses are discussed. Information about the WHO meeting on February 25, 2022, for selection of the 2022-23 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses is available at https://www.who.int/news/item/25-02-2022recommendations-announced-for-influenza-vaccinecomposition-for-the-2022-2023-northern-hemisphereinfluenza-season. Subsequently FDA, which has regulatory authority for vaccines in the United States, makes the final decision regarding vaccine virus composition for U.S.-licensed vaccines.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains the process by which the WHO and FDA select the strains for influenza vaccines, and that all U.S.-licensed vaccines, including Flublok, are required to match these selections. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected strains."
