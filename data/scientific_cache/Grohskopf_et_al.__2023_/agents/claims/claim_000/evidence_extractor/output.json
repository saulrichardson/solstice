      "quote": "Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes Flublok (RIV4) as containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) derived from cell-derived influenza viruses, indicating that the antigens are produced to match the selected strains' genetic sequences, supporting the claim of an identical antigenic match with selected flu strains."

      "quote": "Recommendations for the composition of Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines are made by the World Health Organization (WHO), which organizes a consultation, usually in February of each year. Surveillance data are reviewed, and candidate vaccine viruses are discussed. Information about the WHO meeting on February 25, 2022, for selection of the 2022-23 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses is available at https://www.who.int/news/item/25-02-2022recommendations-announced-for-influenza-vaccinecomposition-for-the-2022-2023-northern-hemisphereinfluenza-season Subsequently FDA which has regulatory authority for vaccines in the United States, convenes a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This committee considers the recommendations of WHO, reviews and discusses similar data, and makes a final decision regarding vaccine virus composition for U.S. licensed vaccines.",
