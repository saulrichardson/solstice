  "explanation": "A table listing various inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccines (by brand/manufacturer), their dose volumes (e.g., 0.5 mL, 0.25 mL) and hemagglutinin (HA) content per strain (e.g., 15 \u00b5g), with footnotes defining HA and age-based dosing recommendations. The table does not mention Flublok or any information about antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Only dosage and content information is provided; no details on strain matching are visible.",
