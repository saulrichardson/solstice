  "explanation": "A table listing trade names and manufacturers of five quadrivalent influenza vaccines and their dose volumes (mL) with corresponding HA content (\u00b5g per vaccine virus) for children aged 6 through 35 months. The table only provides pediatric dosing information (volume and HA content) for various licensed quadrivalent flu vaccines and does not address antigenic matching or WHO/FDA strain selection, so it does not support the claim. Note: No mention of Flublok or antigenic match in the table; image quality sufficient to read all entries.",
