  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

  "explanation": "A table showing contraindications and precautions for recipients with previous severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to different types of influenza vaccines (egg-based IIV or LAIV, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) for the 2022\u201323 season. The table does not support the claim because it addresses allergy-related contraindications for various flu vaccines and does not mention Flublok or antigenic matching with WHO- or FDA-selected strains, therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Table content is clear; no information on antigenic match is present.",
