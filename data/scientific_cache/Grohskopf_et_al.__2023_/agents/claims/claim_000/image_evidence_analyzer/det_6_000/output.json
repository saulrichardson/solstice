  "explanation": "A partial table listing influenza vaccine types (egg-based IIV or LAIV, cell culture\u2013based IIV4, recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4)) with corresponding contraindications and precautions, followed by footnotes defining acronyms (ACIP, cIIV, IIV, IIV4, LAIV, LAIV4, RIV, RIV4). The table provides information on contraindications and precautions for different influenza vaccine formulations but contains no data on antigenic matching of Flublok to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and thus does not support the claim. Note: View is limited to safety and contraindication data; no content on antigenic match is visible.",
