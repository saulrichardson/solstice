If yes, the child gets 1 dose of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine; if no or unknown, the child gets 2 doses of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine \u22654 weeks apart. The figure is a dosing algorithm for pediatric influenza vaccination and does not address Flublok, antigenic match, or WHO/FDA strain selection, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image content is clear but unrelated to antigenic matching or Flublok; confidence is high in this determination.",
