  "explanation": "A flowchart detailing pediatric influenza vaccination recommendations: it asks if a child received two or more doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022. If yes, the child should receive one dose of the 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine. If no or unknown, the child should receive two doses of the 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine administered at least four weeks apart. The figure only outlines dose scheduling for children's seasonal influenza vaccines and provides no data or statements about Flublok's antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and thus does not support the claim.",
