  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza vaccines by trade name and manufacturer, presentations, age indications, HA antigen content per dose, administration route, and mercury content; includes Flublok Quadrivalent among other IIV4, cIIV4, HD-IIV4, aIIV4, and LAIV4 vaccines. The table provides formulation details (dose volume, HA micrograms per strain, route) but contains no information on antigenic match or alignment with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The table focuses solely on vaccine composition and presentation without addressing strain selection or antigenic matching.",
