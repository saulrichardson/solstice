  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-column table listing licensed influenza vaccines (egg-based, cell culture-based, high-dose, adjuvanted, recombinant HA, live attenuated), showing trade names, presentations, age indications, micrograms of hemagglutinin (HA) or virus count per dose, administration route, and mercury content. The table lists Flublok Quadrivalent as a recombinant HA vaccine with dosage and administration details but contains no information about antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible table content; no text regarding strain matching is present.",
