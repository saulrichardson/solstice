  "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table listing characteristics of various seasonal influenza vaccines (egg-based, cell-culture\u2013based, high-dose, adjuvanted, recombinant HA, and live attenuated intranasal), including trade name/manufacturer, presentation volume, age indication, hemagglutinin (HA) content per dose or virus count, route of administration, and mercury content if present. The table provides formulation details (dose volume, HA content, age groups, route, thimerosal content) for Flublok and other influenza vaccines but contains no information about antigenic matching or alignment with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Table excerpt appears clear and complete for listed fields; lack of antigenic match data is not due to image cut-off.",
