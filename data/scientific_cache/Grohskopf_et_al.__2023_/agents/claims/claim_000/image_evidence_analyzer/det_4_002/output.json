  "explanation": "A table listing FDA-licensed influenza vaccines for the 2022\u201323 season, including vaccine names (egg-based standard-dose, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose, adjuvanted, recombinant HA, and live attenuated), manufacturers, presentations (e.g., prefilled syringes, multidose vials), age indications, hemagglutinin content per dose, route of administration, and adjuvant information. The table does not mention antigenic matching or any comparison to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains and therefore does not support the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with those strains.",
