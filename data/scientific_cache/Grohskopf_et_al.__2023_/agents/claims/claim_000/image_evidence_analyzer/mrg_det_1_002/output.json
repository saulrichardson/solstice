  "explanation": "A table of contents and introductory text from an MMWR report, listing sections like Introduction, Methods, Vaccine Composition and Available Vaccines, and credits/attribution information for CDC and MMWR staff. The image contains only a table of contents, introductory narrative about ACIP recommendations, and publication credits. It does not present any data or statements about Flublok or antigenic matching with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No relevant vaccine-specific data appear on this page; image quality is sufficient for reading but content is unrelated to the claim.",
