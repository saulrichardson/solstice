The wording and factual content match the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., bullet points and line breaks).. The quote explicitly states that recombinant (RIV4, i.e., Flublok) influenza vaccines for the 2022-23 season will contain hemagglutinin (HA) antigens derived from the exact strains listed, which are the strains selected by the WHO and FDA for that season. This directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it confirms the vaccine's composition is based on those specific recommendations.",
