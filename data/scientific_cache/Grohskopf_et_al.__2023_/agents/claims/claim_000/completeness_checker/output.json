All influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2022-23 season will be quadrivalent vaccines.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that all U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines, including Flublok, are required to contain antigens that are antigenically similar to those recommended by the FDA, which bases its recommendations on WHO-selected strains. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains."

      "quote": "Quad rivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote specifies that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains hemagglutinin (HA) derived from each vaccine virus, using genetic sequences from cell-derived influenza viruses. Since the vaccine composition is based on the selected strains, this supports the claim that Flublok matches the WHO- and FDA-selected strains."

      "quote": "Recommendations for the composition of Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines are made by the World Health Organization (WHO), which organizes a consultation, usually in February of each year. Surveillance data are reviewed, and candidate vaccine viruses are discussed. Information about the WHO meeting on February 25, 2022, for selection of the 2022-23 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses is available at https://www.who.int/news/item/25-02-2022recommendations-announced-for-influenza-vaccinecomposition-for-the-2022-2023-northern-hemisphereinfluenza-season. Subsequently FDA which has regulatory authority for vaccines in the United States, convenes its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This committee considers the recommendations of WHO, reviews and discusses similar data, and makes a final decision regarding vaccine virus composition for U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains the process by which the WHO and FDA select the strains for U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines, including Flublok. It demonstrates that the antigenic composition of Flublok is determined by these authorities, supporting the claim of an identical antigenic match."
