      "quote": "For the 2022-23 season, U.S. cell culture based in activated (ccIIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from \u2022 an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1 N1) pdm 09 like virus, \u2022 an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3 N2)-like virus, \u2022 an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage like virus), and \u2022 an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage like virus).",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) will contain hemagglutinin (HA) derived from the exact strains listed, which are the WHO- and FDA-recommended strains for the 2022-23 season. This directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it confirms the vaccine's composition matches the recommended strains for that season."

      "quote": "All seasonal influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2022-23 season are quad rival ent, containing hemagglutinin (HA) derived from one influenza A (H1 N1) pdm09 virus, one influenza A (H3 N2) virus, one influenza B/Victoria lineage virus, and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus. In activated influenza vaccines (IIV4 s), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) are expected to be available.",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that all seasonal influenza vaccines expected to be available in the US for 2022-23, including recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok), will contain hemagglutinin (HA) derived from the same four strains: one influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, one influenza A (H3N2), one influenza B/Victoria lineage, and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage. This directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it confirms that the antigenic composition of Flublok matches that of all other vaccines and is based on the selected strains."
