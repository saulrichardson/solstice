      "quote": "For the 2022-23 season, U.S. cell culture based inactivated (ccIIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from \u2022 an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, \u2022 an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus, \u2022 an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and \u2022 an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus.",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that recombinant (RIV4, i.e., Flublok) influenza vaccines for 2022-23 will contain hemagglutinin (HA) derived from the exact strains listed, which are the strains selected by the WHO and FDA for that season. This directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it confirms the vaccine's composition is based on those specific recommendations."
