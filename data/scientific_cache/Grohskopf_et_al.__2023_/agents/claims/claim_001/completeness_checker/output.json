One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",

Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66\u201368) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code-defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69\u201379). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations. The size of this relative benefit has varied from season to season and is not seen in all studies in all seasons, making it difficult to generalize the findings to all or most seasons.",
