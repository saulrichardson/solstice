      "quote": "Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) per vaccine virus, which is three times the 15 \u00b5g per virus found in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the claim about antigen content."

Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs against laboratory confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66 68 and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code defined (rather than laboratory confirmed outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69 79. Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with non adjuvant ed SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza associated hospitalizations. The size of this relative benefit has varied from season to season and is not seen in all studies in all seasons, making it difficult to generalize the findings to all or most seasons.",
