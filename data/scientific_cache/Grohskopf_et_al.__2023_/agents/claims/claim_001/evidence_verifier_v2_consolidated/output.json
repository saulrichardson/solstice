One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).

This matches the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences and no substantive changes to the facts or numbers.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose. This is three times the 15 \u00b5g per virus found in standard-dose flu vaccines, as confirmed elsewhere in the document (see page 19: 'Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose'). The document also states that higher dose vaccines, including RIV4, have been linked to greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines (see page 14: 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3'). Therefore, the quote directly and explicitly supports the claim regarding both the antigen content and the link to greater immunogenicity.",
