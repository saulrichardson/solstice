  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing four influenza vaccine types (egg-based IIV4s, cell-culture based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4, and live attenuated LAIV4) alongside their contraindications and precautions. The table only presents contraindications and precautions for different influenza vaccine types and does not include any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Table appears complete for contraindications/precautions but does not address antigen dosing or immunogenicity; no relevant data present.",
