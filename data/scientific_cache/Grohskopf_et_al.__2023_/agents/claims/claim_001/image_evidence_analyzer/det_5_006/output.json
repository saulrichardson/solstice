  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing contraindications and precautions for different quadrivalent influenza vaccines (cell culture\u2013based inactivated influenza vaccine cIIV4, cell culture\u2013derived inactivated influenza vaccine ccIIV4, recombinant influenza vaccine RIV4, and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine aIIV4), with bullet points detailing allergic reactions, medical conditions, and other special situations. Abbreviations and footnotes are provided at the bottom. The table provides contraindications and precautions for various influenza vaccines but does not mention hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content linked to greater immunogenicity.",
