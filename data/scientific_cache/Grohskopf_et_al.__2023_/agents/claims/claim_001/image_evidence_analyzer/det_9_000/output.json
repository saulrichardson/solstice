  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A decision-tree flowchart showing pediatric influenza vaccination recommendations: asks if a child received \u22652 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022, and directs to give either 1 dose of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine if yes, or 2 doses (\u22654 weeks apart) if no or unknown. The figure does not support the claim because it contains only a dosing algorithm for children's influenza vaccination based on prior doses and does not mention Flublok, hemagglutinin antigen content, or immunogenicity. Note: Analysis limited to image content; no contextual text on antigen content or Flublok is visible.",
