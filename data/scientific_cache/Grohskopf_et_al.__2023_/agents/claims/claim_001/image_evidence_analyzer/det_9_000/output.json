  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart showing influenza vaccination dose recommendations for children aged 6 months through 8 years based on whether they have received \u22652 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022 (Yes leads to 1 dose of 2022\u201323 vaccine; No or unknown leads to 2 doses \u22654 weeks apart). Adjacent text discusses influenza vaccine effectiveness, waning immunity, and study findings. The figure does not mention Flublok, hemagglutinin antigen content, or comparative immunogenicity data, and therefore does not support the claim",
