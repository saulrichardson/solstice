  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image shows a two-column layout: on the left, a table of contents listing sections (Introduction, Methods, Primary Changes and Updates, Recommendations for the Use of Influenza Vaccines, etc.); on the right, introductory text describing CDC adoption of ACIP recommendations and listing publication details and editorial staff of the MMWR report. The image contains only a table of contents and introductory/background information about CDC and ACIP recommendations; it does not present any data on Flublok's hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible, but no relevant clinical or dosage information is present.",
