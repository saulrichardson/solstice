  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A page showing the table of contents for an MMWR report on influenza vaccines on the left, explanatory text about ACIP recommendations on the right, and a list of CDC and MMWR editorial staff at the bottom. The image does not support the claim because it contains only administrative content (table of contents, ACIP description, and staff listings) and includes no data on Flublok, hemagglutinin antigen content, or immunogenicity. Note: The text is clear and legible; no relevant clinical or product information is present.",
