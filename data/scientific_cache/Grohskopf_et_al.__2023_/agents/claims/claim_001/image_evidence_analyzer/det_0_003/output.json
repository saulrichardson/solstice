  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A black rectangular panel containing the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services circular logo on the left and the CDC logo on the right; no textual data or charts present. The image does not support the claim because it only shows organizational logos and contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity comparisons between Flublok and standard-dose flu vaccines, and thus doesn't support the claim. Note: Analysis based solely on visible content; no additional data present in the image.",
