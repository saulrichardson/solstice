  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of licensed influenza vaccines listing trade names, presentations, age indications, hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per virus per dose (\u00b5g HA/0.5 mL), administration route, and mercury content if present. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA vaccine) is listed with 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL HA per virus, whereas standard\u2010dose IIV4 vaccines are listed with 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL per virus. does not support the claim: the table confirms Flublok contains three times the HA antigen content of standard\u2010dose flu vaccines but provides no information on immunogenicity or its comparison to standard\u2010dose vaccines.",
