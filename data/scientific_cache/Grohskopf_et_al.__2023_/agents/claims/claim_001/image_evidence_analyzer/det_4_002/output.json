  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table listing influenza vaccines by trade name, presentations, age indication, HA content per virus strain (\u00b5g/dose), route, and mercury content. Includes standard-dose egg-based IIV4 vaccines (15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL), high-dose IIV4 (60 \u00b5g/0.7 mL), adjuvanted IIV4 (15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL), and recombinant HA vaccine RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent: 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL). Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent is listed with 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain per 0.5 mL dose versus 15 \u00b5g/strain for standard-dose IIV4 vaccines The table shows Flublok contains 3\u00d7 the HA antigen content of standard-dose vaccines but does not include any immunogenicity data; therefore it does not support the full claim about greater immunogenicity",
