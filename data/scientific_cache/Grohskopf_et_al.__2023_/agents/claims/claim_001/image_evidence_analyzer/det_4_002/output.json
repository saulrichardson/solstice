  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various FDA-approved influenza vaccines, including vaccine type (egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose, adjuvanted, recombinant), presentations (prefilled syringes, multidose vials, etc.), age indications, HA antigen content per virus strain per dose (\u00b5g per dose), route of administration, and additional footnotes. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA vaccine) row shows HA content of 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL per strain, whereas standard-dose egg-based and cell culture\u2013based vaccines list 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL per strain. The table shows that Flublok contains 3\u00d7 the HA antigen content compared with standard-dose vaccines but does not present any data or statements regarding immunogenicity; therefore, it does not support the claim about linked greater immunogenicity. Note: None",
