  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing contraindications and precautions for different 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine types (egg-based IIVs and LAIV4, cell-culture\u2013based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) in persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccines. The table only addresses allergy\u2010related contraindications and precautions for various flu vaccine platforms and does not present any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative immunogenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim.",
