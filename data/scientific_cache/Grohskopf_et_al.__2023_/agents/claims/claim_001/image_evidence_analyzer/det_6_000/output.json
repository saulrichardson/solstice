  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing contraindications and precautions for different types of influenza vaccines (egg-based IIVs/LAIV4, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4) in individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions to various vaccine types or egg, for the 2022\u201323 season. The table only addresses allergic reaction contraindications and precautions for different vaccine platforms; it does not mention antigen content or hemagglutinin (HA) dosing. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete regarding allergic precautions but contains no information on HA content or immunogenicity.",
