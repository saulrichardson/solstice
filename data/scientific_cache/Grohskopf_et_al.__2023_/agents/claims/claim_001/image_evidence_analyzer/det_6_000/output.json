  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table excerpt showing contraindications and precautions for egg-based inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV), cell culture\u2013based inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV), and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), with footnotes defining abbreviations (e.g., ACIP, cIIV, RIV). The table addresses contraindications and precautions for different flu vaccine formulations but provides no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparisons of antigen dose. It does not support the claim. Note: Image shows only safety recommendations; antigen content data is not present.",
