  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing trade names of pediatric quadrivalent influenza vaccines and their dose volumes for children aged 6 through 35 months, showing HA content per vaccine virus (7.5 \u00b5g for Afluria Quadrivalent and 15 \u00b5g for Fluarix, Flucelvax, FluLaval, and Fluzone Quadrivalent). The table shows HA antigen content for several standard-dose pediatric flu vaccines (7.5 \u00b5g or 15 \u00b5g per virus) but does not mention Flublok or its antigen content. Therefore, the image does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but limited to pediatric standard-dose vaccines and does not include data on Flublok or adult dosing.",
