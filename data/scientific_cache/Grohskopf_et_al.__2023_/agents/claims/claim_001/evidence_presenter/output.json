      "quote": "Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines).",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA antigen per virus, which is 3 times the amount in standard dose inactivated vaccines (15 \u00b5g). This substantiates the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. The quote also groups RIV4 with HD-IIV4 as 'higher dose vaccines,' which, in the context of the document, are discussed as being linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Thus, the quote provides direct factual support for the claim."

      "quote": "Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines). The adjuvanted vaccine contains 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59. HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA antigen per virus, which is 3 times the 15 \u00b5g in standard-dose inactivated vaccines. It also notes that HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, which addresses the claim that the higher HA antigen content has been linked to greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. The information is explicit and does not require inference."

      "quote": "Quadivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by stating that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, which is three times the 15 \u00b5g per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines (as confirmed elsewhere in the document, e.g., page 19: 'Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose'). However, the quote does not itself address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. The document elsewhere (page 14) does discuss that RIV4 is a higher dose vaccine and that higher dose vaccines have shown relative benefit compared with standard-dose vaccines, but the provided quote only substantiates the HA content comparison, not the immunogenicity link. Thus, the quote fully supports the first part of the claim and provides the factual basis for the second part, which is elaborated elsewhere in the document."

For 2022-23, this category is expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1). Four of these are egg based vaccines, and one is acell culture based vaccine.

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim by providing explicit data: standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4) contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per strain, while Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g per strain, which is 3 times as much. This substantiates the first part of the claim. The document also states elsewhere (page 14) that 'HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines)' and that 'HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies,' supporting the link to greater immunogenicity. Thus, the quote and the document as a whole genuinely support the claim."
