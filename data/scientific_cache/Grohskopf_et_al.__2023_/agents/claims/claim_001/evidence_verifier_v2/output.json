The quote also groups RIV4 and HD-IIV4 as 'higher dose vaccines' and states they contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines. While the quote does not explicitly state that this higher antigen content is 'linked to greater immunogenicity,' the document elsewhere (page 14) discusses that HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence for HD-IIV3, and that these are higher dose vaccines. Thus, the quote and surrounding context substantiate both the antigen content and the link to greater immunogenicity, as required by the claim.",
