  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "document": "Grohskopf_et_al.__2023_",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {
      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, confirming the use of a novel production platform involving insect cells. It also notes that the vaccine is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs, which is consistent with the use of a recombinant, non-egg-based system. While the quote does not mention 'baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)' by name, it does state that recombinant HA is produced in insect cells, which is the key novel aspect of the production platform. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated."

One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years.

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, which is the core of the claim. It also mentions the use of genetic sequences and the absence of influenza viruses or eggs in the manufacturing process, which aligns with the description of a novel production platform using recombinant technology in insect cells. While the quote does not use the term 'baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)' specifically, it does state the essential facts about recombinant HA production in insect cells, which is the key point of the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated."
