      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 21 of the document, in the section 'Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine.' The text states: 'One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).' This matches the provided quote in all substantive details, with only minor formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) is a recombinant influenza vaccine in which hemagglutinin (HA) is produced in an insect cell line, using genetic sequences from cell-derived influenza viruses. This confirms the use of a novel production platform involving recombinant technology and insect cells. While the quote does not mention 'baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)' by name, it does state the essential facts about recombinant HA production in insect cells, which is the core of the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated."

This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).' The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor stylistic differences (e.g., 'produced in an insect cell line' vs. 'expressed in insect cells'), but the factual content is the same.. The quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (RIV4) is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells. It explicitly states that the vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell-derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs. While the quote does not explicitly mention 'baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS),' it does confirm the use of insect cells and recombinant HA, which are the key elements of the claim. The document does not require inference beyond what is stated to support the claim as written."

This matches the quoted content, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, spacing), but all factual content and technical details are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, and that it is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs. This confirms that Flublok is produced using a novel recombinant platform involving insect cells, which is the essence of the claim. While the quote does not use the term 'baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)' specifically, it does state that recombinant HA is produced in an insect cell line, which is the key technical fact required by the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely and explicitly supports the claim based on the information present in the document."
