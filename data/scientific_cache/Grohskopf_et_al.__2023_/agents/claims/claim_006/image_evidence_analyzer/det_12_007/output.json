  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing standard inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine products (Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, Flulaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent) with columns for dose volume and micrograms of hemagglutinin (HA), followed by footnotes defining HA abbreviation and dosing recommendations. This table does not support the claim because it does not mention Flublok or describe a baculovirus expression vector system or insect cell\u2013based production platform; it only lists inactivated influenza vaccines and their HA dose volumes, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table is clear and legible but only covers inactivated vaccines; absence of Flublok or production details is definitive for this excerpt.",
