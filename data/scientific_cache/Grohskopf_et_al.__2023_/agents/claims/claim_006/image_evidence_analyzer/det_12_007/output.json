  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing trade names of quadrivalent influenza vaccines (Afluria, Fluarix, Flucelvax, FluLaval, Fluzone) with their dose volumes (\u00b5g HA per virus) for children aged 6 through 35 months. The table only provides dose volume information for various licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines and does not mention Flublok or describe its production method, therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Limited context: only a dose volume table is shown, so absence of Flublok or production details is expected but confirms no relevant evidence here.",
