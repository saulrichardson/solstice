  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing trade names of pediatric influenza vaccines (Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent) alongside their dose volumes for children aged 6 through 35 months. The table provides dose volume information for various pediatric influenza vaccines but makes no mention of Flublok, recombinant HA expression, insect cells, or a baculovirus expression vector system; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image appears to be clear and complete for the vaccines listed, but Flublok is not included in this table.",
