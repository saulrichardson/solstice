  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image shows the back half of page 2 of an MMWR report, including a table of contents listing sections (e.g., Introduction, Methods, Recommendations) and a block of text describing ACIP recommendations and MMWR publication credits and editorial staff. The image does not support the claim because it contains only a table of contents and publication information from the MMWR report and does not mention Flublok or its production method using a baculovirus expression vector system in insect cells, so it does not support the claim. Note: No mention of vaccine production platforms or Flublok in the visible text; image quality is sufficient to see content but it is unrelated to the claim.",
