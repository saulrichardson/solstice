  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",

  "explanation": "Table listing characteristics of various influenza vaccines for the 2022\u201323 season, including vaccine name/manufacturer, presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe), age indications, hemagglutinin (HA) content per dose, route of administration, and egg protein content. One row identifies Flublok Quadrivalent as a \u201crecombinant HA vaccine\u201d with 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL via IM for adults \u226518 years. The table shows that Flublok is a recombinant HA vaccine but does not describe its production method or mention insect cells or a baculovirus expression vector system, and thus does not support the claim.",
