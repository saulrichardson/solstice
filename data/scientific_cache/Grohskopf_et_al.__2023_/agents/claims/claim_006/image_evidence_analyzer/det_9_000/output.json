  "explanation": "A flowchart illustrating influenza vaccination dosing recommendations for children aged 6 months through 8 years, indicating whether they received any trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022, and recommending either 1 dose of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine or 2 doses of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine administered \u22654 weeks apart. does not support the claim because the figure shows pediatric dosing recommendations and does not mention Flublok, recombinant HA expression, insect cells, or a baculovirus expression vector system.
