  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing contraindications and precautions for the 2022\u201323 influenza vaccines (egg-based IIVs and LAIV4, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) in persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to different types of vaccine (egg-based IIV/LAIV, ccIIV, RIV, or unknown). The table only presents allergy-related contraindications and precautions for various influenza vaccine formats and does not describe Flublok\u2019s production platform, recombinant HA expression in insect cells, or use of a baculovirus expression vector system, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear and legible but focuses solely on allergic reaction guidance; it provides no production or manufacturing details.",
