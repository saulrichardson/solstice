This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, confirming the use of a novel production platform involving insect cells. It also notes that the vaccine is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs, supporting the claim of a recombinant, non-egg-based system."
