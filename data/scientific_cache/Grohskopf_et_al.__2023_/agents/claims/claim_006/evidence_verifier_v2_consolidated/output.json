      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, confirming the use of a novel production platform involving insect cells. It also notes that the vaccine is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs, which is consistent with the use of a recombinant, non-egg-based system. While the quote does not mention 'baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)' by name, it does state that recombinant HA is produced in insect cells, which is the key novel aspect of the production platform. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated.",
