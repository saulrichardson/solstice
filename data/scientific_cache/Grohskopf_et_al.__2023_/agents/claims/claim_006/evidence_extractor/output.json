      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line, confirming the use of a novel production platform involving insect cells. It also notes that the vaccine is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs, supporting the claim of a recombinant, non-egg-based system."

      "quote": "Most available influenza vaccines, with the exception of RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent, licensed for those \u226518 years) and ccIIV4 (Flucelvax Quadrivalent, licensed for those aged \u22656 months), are prepared by propagation of virus in embryonated eggs and might contain trace amounts of egg proteins, such as ovalbumin.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote distinguishes Flublok (RIV4) from traditional egg-based vaccines, indicating that it is not produced using eggs, which is consistent with the use of a novel recombinant platform."
