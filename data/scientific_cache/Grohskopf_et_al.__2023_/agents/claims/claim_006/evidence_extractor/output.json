This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) is a recombinant influenza vaccine in which hemagglutinin (HA) is produced in an insect cell line, confirming the use of a novel production platform involving recombinant technology and insect cells."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote distinguishes Flublok (RIV4) from traditional egg-based vaccines, highlighting that it is not produced in eggs, which supports the claim that it uses a novel, non-egg-based production platform."
