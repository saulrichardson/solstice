      "quote": "Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 21 of the document under the section 'Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine.' The text states: 'One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).' This matches the quote to be verified, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., '\u00b5g' vs 'mcg', 'Quad rival ent' vs 'Quadrivalent'), but all factual content and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 45 micrograms (\u00b5g) of HA per strain (per vaccine virus) in a 0.5-mL dose. The document also provides, in Table 1 and elsewhere, that standard-dose influenza vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per strain. Therefore, the quote explicitly and directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 micrograms of HA per strain versus 15 micrograms per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine."

      "quote": "Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose (7.5 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.25-mL dose). For 2022-23, this category is expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 19 of the document: 'Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 s contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose (7.5 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.25-mL dose). For 2022-23, this category is expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1).' The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote provided.. The quote directly states that standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 vaccines contain 15 micrograms (\u00b5g) of HA per strain in a 0.5-mL dose, which matches the claim's assertion about standard-dose influenza vaccines. While the quote does not mention Flublok or its 45 \u00b5g HA content, it provides the specific comparator value (15 \u00b5g per strain) necessary to support the claim's comparison. The document elsewhere (page 21) confirms that Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, so the quote, in context, genuinely supports the claim."

      "quote": "Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose in activated vaccines).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 9 of the document: 'Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose in activated vaccines).' The wording and numbers match the quote to verify, and the context is a direct comparison of HA content per strain in these vaccines.. The quote explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain, while standard dose inactivated vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g per strain. This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine. No inference is required; the quote provides the exact numbers and comparison."

      "explanation": "The quoted content appears in the document, specifically in the section labeled 'TABLE 1. Influenza vaccines - United States, 2022-23 influenza season.' The table lists 'Afluria Quadrivalent (Seqirus)' as a standard-dose IIV4 with '15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL' HA per strain, and 'Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur)' with '45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL' HA per strain. The quote accurately reflects the factual content and numbers presented in the table, even though there are minor OCR artifacts and formatting differences.. The quote directly supports the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain, while a standard-dose influenza vaccine (such as Afluria Quadrivalent) contains 15 mcg of HA per strain. This matches the claim's assertion about the difference in HA content per strain between Flublok and standard-dose influenza vaccines."

Categories include standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose egg-based, MF59-adjuvanted, recombinant HA, and intranasal vaccines. Evidence: Under the recombinant HA vaccine category, Flublok Quadrivalent is shown with 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain (0.5 mL IM); under standard-dose egg-based and cell culture\u2013based IIV4 entries, the HA amount is 15 \u00b5g per strain (0.5 mL IM). The table shows Flublok contains 45 \u00b5g HA per strain versus 15 \u00b5g per strain in standard-dose vaccines, which supports the claim."
