      "quote": "Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 45 micrograms (\u00b5g) of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain, directly supporting the claim about its HA content."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote clearly states that standard-dose influenza vaccines (IIV4s) contain 15 micrograms (\u00b5g) of HA per strain, which is the comparator for Flublok in the claim."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly compares the HA content of Flublok (RIV4, 45 \u00b5g per strain) to standard-dose vaccines (15 \u00b5g per strain), affirming the claim with explicit numbers."
