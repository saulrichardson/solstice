  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing contraindications and precautions for various influenza vaccines (e.g., cell culture\u2013based inactivated influenza vaccine [ccIIV4], recombinant influenza vaccine [RIV4], adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine [aIIV4]) and accompanying footnotes/abbreviations. The content focuses on allergic reactions, medical conditions, and advisory notes. The table provides information on contraindications and precautions for different influenza vaccines but does not present any data on hemagglutinin (HA) content per strain for Flublok or standard-dose vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image shows only safety/contraindication information; dosing content (HA micrograms) is not present.",
