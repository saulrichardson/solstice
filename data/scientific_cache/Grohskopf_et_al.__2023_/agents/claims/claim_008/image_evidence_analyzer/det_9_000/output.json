  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining influenza vaccination dosing recommendations for children: it asks if a child received \u22652 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022. If yes, administer 1 dose of the 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine; if no or unknown, administer 2 doses of the 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine at least 4 weeks apart. The figure is a dosing algorithm and does not mention hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content for Flublok or standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for its intended purpose, but it contains no information on antigen content per strain.",
