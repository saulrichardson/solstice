  "explanation": "A flowchart determining influenza vaccine dosing for children based on prior vaccination history. The chart asks if the child received \u22652 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent vaccine before July 1, 2022; if yes, recommend 1 dose of 2022\u201323 vaccine; if no or unknown, recommend 2 doses of 2022\u201323 vaccine administered \u22654 weeks apart. The image provides a pediatric influenza vaccine dosing algorithm and does not mention Flublok or microgram amounts of hemagglutinin per strain, so it does not support the claim.",
