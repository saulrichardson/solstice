  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Flowchart showing influenza vaccination dosing recommendations for children aged 6 months through 8 years, based on previous trivalent or quadrivalent vaccine history, indicating whether they need 1 dose or 2 doses for the 2022\u201323 season, with accompanying explanatory text. does not support the claim because the figure provides dosing schedules and prior vaccine history considerations without any information on HA microgram content per strain in Flublok or standard-dose influenza vaccines. Note: Image content focuses solely on dose count and timing, not antigen content; high confidence that HA dosage information is not addressed.",
