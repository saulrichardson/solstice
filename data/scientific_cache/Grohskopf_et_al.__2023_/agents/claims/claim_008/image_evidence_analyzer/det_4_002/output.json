  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A table of U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines listing vaccine name (by subtype and manufacturer), presentation, age indication, hemagglutinin (HA) amount per strain per dose, route, and dose volume. Categories include standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose egg-based, MF59-adjuvanted, recombinant HA, and intranasal vaccines. Evidence: Under the recombinant HA vaccine category, Flublok Quadrivalent is shown with 45 \u00b5g of HA per strain (0.5 mL IM); under standard-dose egg-based and cell culture\u2013based IIV4 entries, the HA amount is 15 \u00b5g per strain (0.5 mL IM). The table shows Flublok contains 45 \u00b5g HA per strain versus 15 \u00b5g per strain in standard-dose vaccines, which supports the claim.",
