  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table listing multiple quadrivalent influenza vaccines (Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, Flulaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent) with their dose volumes and hemagglutinin (HA) content per strain, each showing 0.5 mL (15 \u00b5g) per strain. Evidence: Each listed standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent vaccine shows 0.5 mL (15 \u00b5g) per strain; no entry for Flublok is shown. does not support the claim because while the table confirms 15 \u00b5g HA per strain for standard-dose vaccines, it provides no information on Flublok\u2019s HA content. Note: Table appears cut off and does not display a Flublok entry; image quality and cropping may limit visibility of the full table.",
