  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine trade names and manufacturers and the dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months, with \u00b5g HA per vaccine virus for each product (e.g., Afluria Quadrivalent 0.25 mL (7.5 \u00b5g) or 0.5 mL (15 \u00b5g), Fluarix Quadrivalent 0.5 mL (15 \u00b5g), Flucelvax Quadrivalent 0.5 mL (15 \u00b5g), FluLaval Quadrivalent 0.5 mL (15 \u00b5g), Fluzone Quadrivalent 0.5 mL (15 \u00b5g)). The table does not list Flublok or its HA content per strain and only shows pediatric doses of other quadrivalent vaccines with 7.5\u201315 \u00b5g HA per strain, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table is limited to children aged 6\u201335 months and may not include all vaccine products; Flublok is not represented in this excerpt.",
