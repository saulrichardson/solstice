    {
      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66\u201368) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code\u2013defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69\u201379). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV) and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) have shown relative benefit compared with standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIVs) in certain studies. It also notes that these benefits are particularly observed in the prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations. While the quote does not use the exact phrase 'more robust antibody response,' it does provide evidence that higher-dose recombinant and high-dose vaccines may induce a stronger protective effect than standard-dose egg-based vaccines, which supports the claim as stated."
