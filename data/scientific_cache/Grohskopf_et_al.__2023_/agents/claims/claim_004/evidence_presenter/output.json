    {
      "quote": "Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines). The adjuvanted vaccine contains 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim by providing explicit data that the recombinant flu vaccine (RIV4) is a higher-dose vaccine (45 \u00b5g HA per virus) compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines (15 \u00b5g HA per virus). This difference in antigen content establishes the biological plausibility that a higher-dose recombinant vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines, as higher antigen content is generally associated with stronger immune responses. The quote does not directly state the outcome (antibody response), but it provides the factual basis (higher dose) that supports the claim as stated."
