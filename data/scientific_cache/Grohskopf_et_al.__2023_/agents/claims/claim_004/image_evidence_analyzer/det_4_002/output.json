  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-row, multi-column table listing various quadrivalent influenza vaccines (standard-dose egg-based IIV4, cell culture\u2013based cIIV4, high-dose egg-based HD-IIV4, adjuvanted egg-based aIIV4, recombinant HA RIV4, and live attenuated LAIV4), with columns for trade name/manufacturer, presentation, age indication, \u00b5g hemagglutinin (HA) or virus count per dose, route of administration, and mercury content. Evidence: The recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4, Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL HA per strain compared to 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL HA per strain in standard-dose egg-based vaccines. The table shows that the recombinant vaccine has a higher antigen content (45 \u00b5g vs. 15 \u00b5g) but provides no data on antibody titers or immunogenicity; therefore it does not support the claim that it induces a more robust antibody response. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody response data are present; conclusions limited to antigen content differences.",
