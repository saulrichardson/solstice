  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-column table listing influenza vaccines by trade name and manufacturer, presentation (e.g., prefilled syringe, multi-dose vial), age indications, micrograms of hemagglutinin per dose for each vaccine strain, route of administration, and thimerosal (mercury) content. Vaccines include standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), high-dose egg-based (HD-IIV4), standard-dose egg-based with adjuvant (aIIV4), recombinant HA (RIV4), and intranasal live attenuated (LAIV4). The table provides dosing information but contains no data on antibody titers or immunogenicity comparisons between the higher-dose recombinant vaccine and standard-dose egg-based vaccines, and thus does not support the claim. Note: No direct immunogenicity or antibody response data are shown; only antigen content per dose is listed.",
