  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines for 2022\u201323, organized by vaccine type (standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose egg-based, adjuvanted, recombinant HA, and live attenuated intranasal), with columns showing manufacturer, presentations, age indications, antigen content per dose (\u00b5g per 0.5 mL or other volume), route of administration, and, in some cases, fill volume. The table provides antigen dose and formulation details for various influenza vaccines, including a recombinant HA vaccine (45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL) and standard-dose egg-based vaccines (15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL), but it does not present any immunogenicity or antibody response data, and thus does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity or clinical outcome data are shown; only antigen content and product information are provided.",
