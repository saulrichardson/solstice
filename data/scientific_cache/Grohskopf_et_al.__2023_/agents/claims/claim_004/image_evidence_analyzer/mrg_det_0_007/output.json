  "explanation": "The image shows the header of a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), including the title, series name (\u201cRecommendations and Reports\u201d), volume and issue number (Vol. 71 / No. 1), and date (August 26, 2022). The image contains only the cover header of an MMWR report and does not present any data or discussion regarding antibody responses to higher-dose recombinant versus egg-based standard-dose influenza vaccines, so it does not support the claim.
