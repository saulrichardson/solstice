  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine types (egg-based IIV4s, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4, live attenuated LAIV4) alongside their contraindications and precautions. does not support the claim because the table provides only safety-related information (contraindications and precautions) and contains no immunogenicity or antibody response data comparing higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines to egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: The table lacks any clinical or immunogenicity results; it is limited to contraindications and precautions, so no inference about antibody responses can be made.",
