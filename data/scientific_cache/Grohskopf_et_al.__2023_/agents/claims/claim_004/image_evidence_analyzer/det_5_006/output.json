  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table listing contraindications and precautions for various influenza vaccines (cell culture\u2013based, recombinant, egg-based inactivated, and live attenuated quadrivalent vaccines), including history of severe allergic reaction, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, acute illness, asthma, immunocompromised status, and other medical conditions. The table provides only safety-related contraindications and precautions for different influenza vaccines and does not present any immunogenicity or antibody response data, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to identify content; however, it contains no efficacy or immunogenicity information.",
