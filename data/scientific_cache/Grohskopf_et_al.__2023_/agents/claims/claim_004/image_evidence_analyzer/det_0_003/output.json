  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image appears as a nearly solid black rectangle with faint, indistinct grey lines suggesting axis lines but no legible text, data points, curves, labels, or annotations visible. does not support the claim because there is no readable evidence in the image comparing higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine antibody responses to egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: Image quality is extremely low or the content is entirely obscured, preventing interpretation of any study data.",
