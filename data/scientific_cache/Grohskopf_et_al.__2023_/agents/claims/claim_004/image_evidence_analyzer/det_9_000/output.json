  "explanation": "Flowchart showing whether a child who received \u22652 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022 should receive 1 dose or 2 doses (\u22654 weeks apart) of the 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine. The figure is an algorithm for pediatric influenza vaccine dosing based on prior vaccination history and does not support the claim about higher-dose recombinant vaccines inducing a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
