  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining influenza vaccination dosing for children: it asks whether the child received \u22652 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022. If yes, the child receives 1 dose of the 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine; if no or unknown, the child receives 2 doses of the 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine administered \u22654 weeks apart. The image provides a dosing algorithm for pediatric influenza vaccination based on prior dose history and does not present any data comparing antibody responses between higher-dose recombinant vaccines and egg-based standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: The chart is a vaccination schedule guideline and does not address vaccine type or immunogenicity outcomes.",
