If yes, administer 1 dose of 2022\u201323 vaccine; if no or unknown, administer 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart. does not support the claim because the figure only outlines dose scheduling for pediatric influenza vaccination and provides no data on antibody responses or comparisons between higher-dose recombinant and egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
