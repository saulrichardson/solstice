  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart showing influenza vaccination dosing recommendations for children aged 6 months through 8 years based on whether they\u2019ve received prior trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022. It directs those with prior doses to receive 1 dose of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine and those with no or unknown prior doses to receive 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart, accompanied by explanatory text below. The figure provides a pediatric influenza vaccine dosing algorithm and contains no data comparing higher-dose recombinant vaccines to egg-based standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image quality and content appear complete for dosing guidance; no relevant immunogenicity data present.",
