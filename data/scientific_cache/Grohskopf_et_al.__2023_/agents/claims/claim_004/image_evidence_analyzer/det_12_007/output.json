  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing trade names of quadrivalent influenza vaccines and the dose volume (\u03bcg HA per vaccine virus) recommended for children aged 6 through 35 months, showing Afluria Quadrivalent at 0.25 mL (7.5 \u03bcg) and other vaccines (Fluarix, Flucelvax, FluLaval, Fluzone) at 0.5 mL (15 \u03bcg). The table only provides dose volumes for pediatric influenza vaccines and does not present any immunogenicity or antibody response data comparing higher-dose recombinant vaccines to egg-based standard-dose vaccines; it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for the table shown; however, no immunogenicity outcomes are provided.",
