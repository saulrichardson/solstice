  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A portion of a table listing various quadrivalent influenza vaccine products (e.g., Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, Flulaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent), their manufacturers, and their per-dose volumes and hemagglutinin (HA) content (e.g., 0.25 mL (7.5 \u00b5g) or 0.5 mL (15 \u00b5g)), with footnotes on age-based dosing recommendations. The table provides information on vaccine names, manufacturers, dose volumes, and HA content but contains no data on antibody responses or comparisons between higher-dose recombinant vaccines and egg-based standard-dose vaccines, and thus does not support the claim. Note: None",
