  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-column table listing influenza vaccine trade names (e.g., Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent) and the dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months, specified in mL and corresponding \u00b5g of hemagglutinin per vaccine virus The table only provides dose volumes for various quadrivalent vaccines in young children and does not present any data on recombinant versus egg-based vaccines or comparative antibody responses, and therefore does not support the claim Note: Limited to dose volume information; no immunogenicity or comparative efficacy data are shown",
