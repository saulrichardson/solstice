  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table listing trade names of quadrivalent influenza vaccines (Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent), their manufacturers, and the dose volume (in mL) with corresponding \u00b5g hemagglutinin per vaccine virus for children aged 6 through 35 months. does not support the claim because the table only provides antigen dose volumes for various egg-based quadrivalent vaccines in young children and contains no data on recombinant vaccine formulations or antibody response comparisons. Note: Table shows only dosing amounts; immunogenicity or recombinant vs egg-based response data are not present, limiting confidence in addressing the claim.",
