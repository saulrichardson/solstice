  "explanation": "The image shows the table of contents for an MMWR report (listing sections such as Introduction, Methods, Recommendations for Use of Influenza Vaccines, etc.) on the left, and on the right a block of text describing CDC adoption of ACIP recommendations and harmonization with professional organizations. There are no data figures, tables, or immunogenicity results visible. does not support the claim because the image contains only administrative and organizational content (table of contents and ACIP description) and no clinical data comparing higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine to egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: The image is clear but contains no relevant efficacy or antibody response data; thus confidence in this assessment is high.",
