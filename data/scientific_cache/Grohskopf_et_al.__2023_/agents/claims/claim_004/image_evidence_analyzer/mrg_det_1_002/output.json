  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Page containing table of contents, CDC adoption of ACIP recommendations text, and lists of CDC staff and editorial boards; no clinical data or vaccine study results. The image does not support the claim because it contains only administrative and editorial information with no data comparing higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines to egg-based standard-dose vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image quality is clear but content is front matter without clinical evidence.",
