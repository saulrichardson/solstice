  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing contraindications and precautions for 2022\u201323 influenza vaccines (egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4, cell culture\u2013based quadrivalent [ccIIV4], and recombinant quadrivalent [RIV4]) in patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to various influenza vaccine types. The table provides allergy-related contraindications and precautions for different flu vaccine formulations and does not present any immunogenicity or antibody response data, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table is focused solely on allergy guidance; no antibody titer or immunogenicity information is included.",
