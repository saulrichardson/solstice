  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to prior influenza vaccines by vaccine type (egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4, cell-culture ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) for the 2022\u201323 season, indicating contraindications or precautions for each vaccine in egg-allergic individuals. The table only provides allergy guidance (contraindications and precautions) for different influenza vaccine platforms and does not include any data on antibody titers, immunogenicity, or dose comparisons. It does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for allergy guidance but contains no immunogenicity or dose-response information.",
