  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing 2022\u201323 influenza vaccines (egg-based IIVs/LAIV4, cell culture\u2013based IIV4, and recombinant RIV4) and their contraindications or precautions in persons with previous severe allergic reactions to any egg-based IIV/LAIV, any ccIIV, any RIV, or unknown influenza vaccine. The table addresses vaccine contraindications and precautions for allergic individuals and contains no data on antibody responses or immunogenicity; it does not support the claim regarding higher-dose recombinant versus standard-dose egg-based vaccines. Note: Limited to a hypersensitivity/contraindication table; no immunogenicity or dosage information is presented.",
