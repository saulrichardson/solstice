      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66\u201368) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code\u2013defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69\u201379). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that recombinant (RIV) and high-dose (HD-IIV) vaccines have shown a relative benefit compared to standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIVs), supporting the claim that higher-dose recombinant vaccines may induce a more robust antibody response."

The adjuvanted vaccine contains 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59.",

      "quote": "Randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness are few in number and were conducted over few influenza seasons. HD-IIV3 was more effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or culture-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) in a two-season randomized study conducted among 32,000 persons aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 24%; 95% CI: 10\u201336; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single-season randomized trials of RIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 that assessed culture-confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 that examined PCR-confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged \u226565 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: \u221217% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate). The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged \u226550 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10\u201347) as well as in culture-confirmed ILI among those aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 42%; 95% CI: 9%\u201365%) (68).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence from randomized trials that higher-dose recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) induced a more robust immune response (as measured by efficacy against PCR-confirmed influenza) than standard-dose egg-based vaccines in certain populations, supporting the claim."

      "quote": "A randomized clinical trial during the 2017-18 influenza season suggested that delaying IIV4 administration by 2 weeks in children receiving diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and a cellular pertussis (DTaP) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) did not result in a significant difference in immunogenicity to any of the antigens compared with coadministration. However, among children who received IIV4 and PCV13 concomitantly, the frequency of fever on days 0\u20131 postvaccination was higher than among those who received the vaccines separately (112).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that immunogenicity (antibody response) was not reduced when IIV4 was coadministered with other vaccines, supporting the idea that higher-dose or recombinant vaccines can induce robust antibody responses. While not a direct comparison to standard-dose egg-based vaccines, it affirms the robust immunogenicity of these vaccines.",

No new safety signals were noted, and prevalence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions was similar between the two groups.",
