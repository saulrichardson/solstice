      "quote": "Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard dose vaccines (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines). Adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4) contains MF59 adjuvant.",

      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66\u201368) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code\u2013defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69\u201379). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations. The size of this relative benefit has varied from season to season and is not seen in all studies in all seasons, making it difficult to generalize the findings to all or most seasons.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that RIV (recombinant influenza vaccine, higher-dose) has shown relative benefit compared to standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIVs), supporting the claim that higher-dose recombinant vaccines may induce a more robust response."

      "quote": "Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines). The adjuvanted vaccine contains 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59.",

      "quote": "Randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness are few in number and were conducted over few influenza seasons. HD-IIV3 was more effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or culture-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) in a two-season randomized study conducted among 32,000 persons aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 24%; 95% CI: 10\u201336; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single-season randomized trials of RIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 that assessed culture-confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 that examined PCR-confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged \u226565 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: \u221217% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate). The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged \u226550 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10\u201347) as well as in culture-confirmed ILI among those aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 42%; 95% CI: 9%\u201365%) (68).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence from randomized trials that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV4) can induce a more robust response (as measured by efficacy against influenza illness) than standard-dose egg-based vaccines, especially in certain age groups."
