      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66\u201368) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code\u2013defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69\u201379). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that recombinant (RIV) and high-dose (HD-IIV) vaccines have shown a relative benefit compared to standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIVs), supporting the claim that higher-dose recombinant vaccines may induce a more robust response."

The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged \u226550 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10\u201347) as well as in culture-confirmed ILI among those aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 42%; 95% CI: 9%\u201365%) (68).",
