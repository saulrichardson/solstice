      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66\u201368) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code\u2013defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69\u201379). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that recombinant (RIV) and high-dose (HD-IIV) vaccines have shown a relative benefit compared to standard-dose, egg-based vaccines, supporting the claim that higher-dose recombinant vaccines may induce a more robust response."

      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have been evaluated in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs in this age group. Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 \u00b5g for HD-IIV4 and 45 \u00b5g for RIV4, compared with 15 \u00b5g for standard dose inactivated vaccines). The adjuvanted vaccine contains 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59.",

      "quote": "Randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness are few in number and were conducted over few influenza seasons. HD-IIV3 was more effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or culture-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) in a two-season randomized study conducted among 32,000 persons aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 24%; 95% CI: 10\u201336; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single-season randomized trials of RIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 that assessed culture-confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 that examined PCR-confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged \u226565 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: \u221217% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate). The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged \u226550 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10\u201347) as well as in culture-confirmed ILI among those aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 42%; 95% CI: 9%\u201365%) (68).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence from randomized studies that RIV4 (a higher-dose recombinant vaccine) showed a relative benefit over standard-dose, egg-based vaccines in inducing protection, which is a proxy for a more robust antibody response."
