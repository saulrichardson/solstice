      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that a randomized clinical trial found that the higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV4) induced significantly higher postvaccination HAI antibody responses compared to a licensed, egg-based, standard-dose IIV4 among adults aged \u226550 years. It also specifies that the largest differences were observed for the A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata components. This is direct evidence that RIV4 may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines, as claimed.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote is found on page 14 of the document, in the section discussing randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs. The document states: 'The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged \u226550 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10\u201347) as well as in serologically confirmed ILI among those aged \u226565 years. A randomized clinical trial comparing RIV4 with a licensed, egg-based, standard-dose IIV4 among adults aged \u226550 years found that RIV4 induced significantly higher postvaccination hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses to all four vaccine viruses, with the largest differences observed for the A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata components.' The wording and factual content match the quote to be verified.",
