  "explanation": "Page 2 of a CDC MMWR report showing the table of contents (Introduction, Methods, Primary Changes and Updates, Recommendations for the Use of Influenza Vaccines, etc.), a section on CDC adoption of ACIP recommendations, and a listing of editorial and production staff. The page contains only administrative content (table of contents, policy adoption statement, staff credits) and does not include any data or discussion of recombinant vaccine technology, immune response breadth, or cross-protection. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to read all text; no relevant scientific data are present on this page.",
