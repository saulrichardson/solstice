  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining pediatric influenza vaccination dosing: if a child received two or more doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022, then give one dose of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine; if no or unknown prior doses, give two doses of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine four weeks apart. The flowchart only provides dose scheduling based on prior vaccine history and does not present any data or statements about recombinant vaccine technology, immune response breadth, or cross-protection, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and fully legible; there is no mention of recombinant technology or immunogenicity data.",
