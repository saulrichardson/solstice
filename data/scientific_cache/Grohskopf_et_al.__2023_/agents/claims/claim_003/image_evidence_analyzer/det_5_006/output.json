  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A table listing four influenza vaccine types (egg-based IIV4s, cell-culture based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4, and live attenuated LAIV4) alongside their contraindications and precautions. The table only presents contraindications and precautions for different vaccine platforms; it does not provide any data or statements about immune response breadth or cross-protection, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; no immunogenicity or efficacy data are shown in the image.",
