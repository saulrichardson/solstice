  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing contraindications and precautions for various influenza vaccines (e.g., ccIIV4, RIV4, LAIV4), including history of severe allergic reactions, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, immunocompromised status, asthma, pregnancy, and other safety-related criteria. The table provides safety and contraindication information for different influenza vaccines and does not include any data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or mismatch season effectiveness, and therefore doesn't support the claim. Note: Image appears to be complete for the table shown; limited to safety and precaution information with no efficacy or immunogenicity data present.",
