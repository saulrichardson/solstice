  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products (trade name, manufacturer), presentation formats, age indications, hemagglutinin content or virus count per dose, administration route, and thimerosal content. Vaccines are grouped by type (egg-based standard dose quadrivalent, cell culture-based, high-dose, adjuvanted, recombinant HA, and live attenuated intranasal). The table provides formulation details (dosages, routes, age groups) for various influenza vaccines, including the recombinant HA vaccine, but contains no immunogenicity or cross-protection data. Therefore it does not support the claim about broader immune response or cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: Analysis limited to a product specification table; no efficacy or immunologic outcome data are present.",
