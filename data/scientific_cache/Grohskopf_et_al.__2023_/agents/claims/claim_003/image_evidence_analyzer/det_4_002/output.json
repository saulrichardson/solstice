  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010column table listing various licensed influenza vaccines (egg-based standard-dose, cell culture-based, high-dose, adjuvanted, recombinant HA, and live attenuated intranasal) with details on trade name/manufacturer, presentations (dose form and volume), age indications, hemagglutinin content per strain (\u00b5g HA or virus count), administration route, and thimerosal content. The table provides only vaccine formulations, dosages, age indications, and preservative content. It contains no data on breadth of immune response, cross-protection, or mismatch season effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible table content; no immunogenicity or efficacy data are presented.",
