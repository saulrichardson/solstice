  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular listing of various licensed influenza vaccines including trade names (egg-based, cell-culture based, high-dose, adjuvanted, recombinant HA, and live attenuated), their presentations (e.g., volume and formulation), approved age indications, amount of hemagglutinin antigen per dose, route of administration, and mercury content if thimerosal is present. The table provides formulation, dosing, and licensing information for different influenza vaccines but contains no immunogenicity or cross-protection data; it does not support the claim. Note: Table does not include any immune response or mismatch season performance data; image is clear but limited to vaccine specifications.",
