  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing trade names of quadrivalent influenza vaccines (Afluria, Fluarix, Flucelvax, FluLaval, Fluzone) with their manufacturers and dose volumes (mL and \u00b5g HA per virus) for children aged 6 through 35 months. The table provides only dose volumes and antigen content for various quadrivalent influenza vaccines in young children and contains no data on immune response breadth, recombinant technology, cross-protection, or mismatch season performance, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible table content; no immunogenicity or technology details present.",
