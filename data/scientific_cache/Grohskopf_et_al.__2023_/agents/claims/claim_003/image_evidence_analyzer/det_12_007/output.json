  "explanation": "A table listing trade names of quadrivalent influenza vaccines from various manufacturers and their dose volumes (\u00b5g HA per vaccine virus) for children aged 6 through 35 months. The table only provides dosing information for different quadrivalent influenza vaccines in young children and contains no data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or mismatch season effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible dosing data; no relevant immunogenicity or clinical outcome information is presented.",
