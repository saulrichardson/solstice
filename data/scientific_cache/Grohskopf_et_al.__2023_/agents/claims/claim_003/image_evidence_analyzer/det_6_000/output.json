  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "Extract of a table listing contraindications and precautions for different types of influenza vaccines (egg-based IIV/LAIV4, cell culture\u2013based inactivated influenza vaccine, and recombinant influenza vaccine), with footnotes and abbreviations. The table only provides safety-related contraindications and precautions for various influenza vaccine formulations and does not present any data or statements on immune response breadth or cross-protection, so it does not support the claim. Note: Limited context: only the safety table is visible, no immunogenicity or efficacy data are shown.",
