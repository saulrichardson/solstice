  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing available 2022\u201323 influenza vaccines (egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4, cell-culture ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4) with rows categorizing individuals by history of previous severe allergic reaction to any egg-based IIV/LAIV, any ccIIV, any RIV, or unknown influenza vaccine. For each vaccine type and reaction history, the table indicates whether vaccination is a contraindication, a precaution, or if allergist consultation is recommended. This table addresses safety guidance for persons with prior vaccine-related allergic reactions; it contains no data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or mismatch season efficacy, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; table is clearly focused on allergy contraindications rather than immunogenicity outcomes.",
