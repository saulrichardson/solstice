  "explanation": "A table outlining contraindications and precautions for various 2022\u201323 influenza vaccines (egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) in persons with a history of severe allergic reactions to different vaccine types or unknown influenza vaccine history. The table addresses allergic reaction contraindications and precautions for different influenza vaccine platforms; it contains no data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or mismatch season efficacy, and therefore does not support the claim.
