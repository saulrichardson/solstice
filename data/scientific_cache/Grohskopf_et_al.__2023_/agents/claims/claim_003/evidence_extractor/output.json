      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes the recombinant technology used in RIV4, which is relevant because the use of recombinant HA from cell-derived viruses is a key mechanism by which a broader immune response and potential cross-protection may be achieved, especially in mismatch seasons."

      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66\u201368) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code defined (rather than laboratory confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69\u201379). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza associated hospitalizations. The size of this relative benefit has varied from season to season and is not seen in all studies in all seasons, making it difficult to generalize the findings to all or most seasons.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that recombinant vaccines (RIV) have shown a relative benefit over standard-dose inactivated vaccines in some studies, supporting the claim that recombinant technology can lead to broader or more effective immune responses, which may translate to cross-protection."

      "quote": "A retrospective analysis of relative effectiveness of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 against influenza coded hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries during the 2019-20 season noted a relative effectiveness of 17% (95% CI: 9\u201324; certainty level: 3, low) (72).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides data showing that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) was more effective than standard-dose inactivated vaccine in preventing influenza-coded hospitalizations, which supports the idea that recombinant technology can provide broader protection, potentially including cross-protection in mismatch seasons."
