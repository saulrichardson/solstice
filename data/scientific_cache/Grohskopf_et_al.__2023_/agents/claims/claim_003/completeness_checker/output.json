      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes the recombinant technology used in RIV4, which is central to the claim about recombinant vaccines. It establishes that the vaccine is made using recombinant methods, which is necessary context for understanding its potential for broader immune responses and cross-protection."

      "quote": "HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66\u201368) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code defined (rather than laboratory confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69\u201379). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza associated hospitalizations. The size of this relative benefit has varied from season to season and is not seen in all studies in all seasons, making it difficult to generalize the findings to all or most seasons.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that recombinant influenza vaccines (RIV) have shown a relative benefit over standard-dose inactivated vaccines in some studies, particularly in preventing hospitalizations. This supports the claim that recombinant technology can lead to a broader or more effective immune response, which may translate to cross-protection even in seasons with mismatched strains."

      "quote": "A retrospective analysis of relative effectiveness of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 against influenza coded hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries during the 2019-20 season noted a relative effectiveness of 17% (95% CI: 9\u201324; certainty level: 3, low) (72).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides specific data showing that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) was more effective than standard-dose inactivated vaccine (SD-IIV4) in preventing influenza-coded hospitalizations, which supports the claim that recombinant technology can provide broader protection, potentially including cross-protection in mismatch seasons."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides quantitative evidence that RIV4 (recombinant vaccine) was more effective than standard-dose inactivated vaccine in preventing PCR-confirmed influenza, supporting the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and potentially better cross-protection."

Pregnancy registries and surveillance studies exist for certain products, for which information can be found in package inserts.",
      "relevance_explanation": "While this quote does not directly address cross-protection, it provides context that RIV (recombinant vaccine) has been studied in various populations, supporting its broader applicability and safety, which is relevant to the claim of broader immune response."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes the recombinant technology used in RIV4, which is relevant because the use of recombinant HA from cell-derived viruses (rather than egg-based or live virus) is a key mechanism by which recombinant vaccines may elicit a broader immune response, potentially providing cross-protection even in mismatch seasons.",
