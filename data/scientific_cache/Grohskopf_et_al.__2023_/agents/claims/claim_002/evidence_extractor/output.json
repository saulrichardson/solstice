      "quote": "Egg based and cell culture based vaccines differ in the substrate in which reference vaccine viruses supplied to the manufacturer are propagated in quantities sufficient to produce the needed number of doses of vaccine. For the IIV4 s Afluria Quad rival ent (43) Fluarix Quad rival ent (123) FluLaval Quad rival ent (124) and Flu zone Quad rival ent (44), reference vaccine viruses are propagated in eggs. For Flu cel vax Quad rival ent, reference vaccine viruses are propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells instead of eggs (125).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that both egg-based and cell-based flu vaccines use biological substrates (eggs or cell cultures) to propagate vaccine viruses, which is the context in which mutations can occur during production."

      "relevance_explanation": "This statement highlights that the process of growing vaccine viruses in eggs or cell cultures is a key step in vaccine production, which is relevant because such propagation can lead to mutations."

      "quote": "For the 2022-23 season, U.S. egg based influenza vaccines (i.e., vaccines other than ccIIV4 and RIV4) will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1 N1) pdm 09 like virus. For Flu cel vax Quad rival ent, reference vaccine viruses are propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells instead of eggs (125).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote clarifies that cell-based vaccines use a different propagation method (cell culture) than egg-based vaccines, both of which can introduce mutations during the production process."

      "quote": "The effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors, such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages (for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine (12).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote supports the claim by stating that vaccine effectiveness depends on how closely the vaccine viruses match circulating viruses, which can be affected if mutations arise during production."
