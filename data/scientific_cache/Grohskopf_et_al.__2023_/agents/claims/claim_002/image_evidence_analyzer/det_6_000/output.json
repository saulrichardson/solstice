  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing contraindications and precautions for the 2022\u201323 influenza vaccines (egg-based inactivated and live attenuated [IIV/LAIV4], cell-culture\u2013based [ccIIV4], and recombinant [RIV4]) in individuals with a history of severe allergic reaction to vaccines. The table addresses allergic reaction contraindications and precautions for different flu vaccine formulations and does not mention mutations occurring during vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The table is clearly focused on allergy-related guidance; there is no discussion of antigenic changes or production mutations.",
