  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A clinical guidance table listing types of previous severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) on the left and the 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine formats across the top (Egg-based IIVs and LAIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4). Each cell indicates either 'Contraindication,' 'Precaution,' or 'Allergist consultation recommended' for each combination. The table addresses contraindications and precautions for patients with egg or vaccine allergies. It contains no information about mutations arising during vaccine production or impacts on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited by table's focus on allergy guidance; no mention of production mutations or efficacy.",
