  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining pediatric influenza vaccination dosing recommendations for the 2022\u201323 season. It asks whether the child received \u22652 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022, and directs to either 1 dose of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine if yes, or 2 doses \u22654 weeks apart if no or unknown. The figure contains dosing guidelines for child influenza vaccination schedules and does not mention cell-based or egg-based vaccine production methods, mutations, or effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim.",
