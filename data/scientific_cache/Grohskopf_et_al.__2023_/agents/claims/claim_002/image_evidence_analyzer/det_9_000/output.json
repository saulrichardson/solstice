  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining influenza vaccination dose recommendations for children aged 6 months through 8 years, based on whether they received a trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022, along with accompanying explanatory text on timing of doses and vaccine visit recommendations. The figure solely presents dosing schedules for pediatric influenza vaccination and contains no information on cell- or egg-based vaccine production, mutations, or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim.",
