  "explanation": "A flowchart determining influenza vaccination dosing in children: it asks if the child received \u22652 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022 and then directs to either 1 dose of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine (if yes) or 2 doses of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine \u22654 weeks apart (if no or unknown). The figure provides a dosing algorithm for pediatric influenza vaccination and contains no information on cell- or egg-based vaccine production, mutations, or their impact on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim.",
