  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing influenza vaccine products, including trade names, manufacturers, presentations (e.g., prefilled syringes, multi-dose vials), age indications, antigen content per dose (\u00b5g HA or virus count), administration route, and thimerosal (mercury) content. Vaccine types listed include standard-dose egg-based IIV4, cell culture\u2013based cIIV4, high-dose egg-based HD-IIV4, adjuvanted egg-based aIIV4, recombinant HA RIV4, and live attenuated egg-based LAIV4. The table provides product specifications and formulation details but contains no information about mutations arising during egg- or cell-based production or any impact on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Table is legible and complete for listed fields; no mutation or efficacy data are present.",
