  "explanation": "Table listing various licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines, grouped by vaccine type (egg-based standard-dose IIV4, cell culture-based cIIV4, high-dose egg-based HD-IIV4, adjuvanted egg-based aIIV4, recombinant HA RIV4, and egg-based live attenuated LAIV4), including trade names, manufacturers, presentations, age indications, antigen content per dose, administration route, and thimerosal content. The table provides only formulation details (manufacturing substrate, antigen dose, age indication, route, and preservative content) and does not mention mutations or changes acquired during production or any impact on vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim.",
