  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various licensed influenza vaccines, including standard-dose egg-based vaccines, cell culture\u2013based vaccines, high-dose egg-based vaccines, adjuvanted vaccines, recombinant HA vaccines, and live attenuated vaccines, with details on presentations, age indications, antigen content per dose, administration route, and manufacturer. The table merely enumerates vaccine types, dosages, and formulations without any mention of mutations arising during production or effects on vaccine effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Image text is legible and complete; no reference to production mutations or reduced effectiveness is present.",
