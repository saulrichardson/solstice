  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine trade names and their dose volumes for children aged 6 through 35 months (\u00b5g HA per vaccine virus), including Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluCelvax Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, and Fluzone Quadrivalent with corresponding milliliter and microgram dosages. The table only provides dose volume information for various quadrivalent flu vaccines in young children and does not mention production methods, the potential for mutations during manufacturing, or any effects on vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim.",
