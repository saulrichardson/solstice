  "explanation": "A table listing trade names of quadrivalent influenza vaccines (Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent), their manufacturers (Seqirus, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi Pasteur), and the dose volume with \u00b5g HA per vaccine virus for children aged 6 through 35 months. The table only provides vaccine trade names, manufacturers, and pediatric dose volumes; it does not mention production methods, potential mutations, or effects on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim.",
