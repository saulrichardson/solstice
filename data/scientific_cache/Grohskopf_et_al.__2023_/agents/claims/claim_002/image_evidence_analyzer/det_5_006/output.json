  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing seasonal influenza vaccine types (egg-based IIV4s, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4, and live attenuated LAIV4) alongside their contraindications and precautions. The table only details contraindications and precautions for different flu vaccine types; it does not mention production processes, mutations, or effects on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis based solely on visible content; absence of mutation-related information is clear.",
