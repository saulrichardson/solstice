      "quote": "Egg based and cell culture based vaccines differ in the substrate in which reference vaccine viruses supplied to the manufacturer are propagated in quantities sufficient to produce the needed number of doses of vaccine. For the IIV4 s Afluria Quadrivalent (43), Fluarix Quadrivalent (123), FluLaval Quadrivalent (124) and Fluzone Quadrivalent (44), reference vaccine viruses are propagated in eggs. For Flucelvax Quadrivalent, reference vaccine viruses are propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells instead of eggs (125).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that both egg-based and cell-based flu vaccines involve propagation of the virus in biological substrates (eggs or cell cultures), which is the context in which mutations can occur during production."

      "quote": "The effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors, such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages (for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine (12).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly links vaccine effectiveness to the similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine, which can be affected if mutations arise during vaccine production."

      "quote": "In addition to the factors observed to be associated with waning immunity across studies, observed decreases in protection might be at least in part attributable to bias, unmeasured confounding, or the late season emergence of antigenic drift variants of influenza viruses that are less well matched to the vaccine viruses.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote notes that the emergence of antigenic drift variants (mutations) can result in a mismatch between vaccine and circulating viruses, reducing effectiveness. Such variants can arise during vaccine production, especially in egg- or cell-based systems."
