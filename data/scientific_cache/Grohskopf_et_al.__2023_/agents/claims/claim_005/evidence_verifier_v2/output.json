      "quote": "Randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with non adjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory confirmed influenza illness are few in number and were conducted over few influenza seasons. HD-IIV3 was more effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or culture confirmed influenza like illness (ILI) in a two season randomized study conducted among 32,000 persons aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 24%; 95% CI: 10\u201336; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single season randomized trials of RIV versus non adjuvanted SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus non adjuvanted SD-IIV3 that assessed culture confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus non adjuvanted SD-IIV4 that examined PCR-confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged \u226565 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: \u221217% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate). The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over non adjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged \u226550 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10\u201347 as well as in a qualified ILI endpoint among those aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 42%; 95% CI: 9%\u201365%) (68).",

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that a randomized trial compared RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) to a nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine). This matches the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), as Fluarix is a standard-dose quadrivalent IIV. The quote provides specific details about the study design, population, and results, confirming the claim without requiring inference.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 14 of the document, in the section discussing randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs. The text is nearly verbatim, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'non adjuvanted' vs 'nonadjuvanted', and some line breaks). The key facts, numbers, and technical content are all preserved, including the description of two single season randomized trials of RIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV, one of which is a comparison of RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine), and the outcomes in persons aged \u226565 years and \u226550 years.",

      "quote": "Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total). Contra indications and Precautions for the Use of RIV4. RIV4 is contra indicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction.",

Subsequently, in October 2021, FDA approved Flu cel vax Quad rival ent for persons aged \u22656 months. Approval was based on a randomized immunogen i city and safety study conducted among 2,402 children aged 6 through 47 months (of whom 894 were aged 6 through 23 months). Children were randomized n a 2:1 ratio to receive either Flu cel vax Quad rival ent (0.5 mL/dose containing 15 \u00b5g HA per virus for all ages) or a licensed comparator egg based IIV4 (0.25 mL/dose containing 7.5 \u00b5g HA per virus for those aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL/dose containing 15 \u00b5g HA per virus for those aged 36 through 47 months) (130). Flu cel vax Quad rival ent met pre specified immunogen i city criteria for all four viruses. No new safety signals were noted, and prevalence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions was similar between the two groups.",
