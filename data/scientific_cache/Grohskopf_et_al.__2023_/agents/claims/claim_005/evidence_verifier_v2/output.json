      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It describes a randomized trial comparing RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) to nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4, which is the category that includes Fluarix Quadrivalent. The document's Table 1 (page 5) confirms that Fluarix Quadrivalent is a standard-dose, nonadjuvanted, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4). Therefore, the quote substantiates that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) or an equivalent vaccine in that category.",

      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total). Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of RIV4. RIV4 is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction.",
