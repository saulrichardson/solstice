      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that a randomized trial compared RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) with a nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine) and examined PCR-confirmed influenza-like illness. Fluarix Quadrivalent is a standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4, and the document's Table 1 confirms it is one of the SD-IIV4s. Therefore, the quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) or an equivalent SD-IIV4.",

      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total). Contra indications and Precautions for the Use of RIV4. RIV4 is contra indicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of RIV4.",
