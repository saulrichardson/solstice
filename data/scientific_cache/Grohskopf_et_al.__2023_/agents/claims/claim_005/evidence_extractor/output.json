      "quote": "Quad rival ent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quad rival ent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total). Contra indications and Precautions for the Use of RIV4. RIV4 is contra indicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly identifies Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) as a recombinant influenza vaccine available for the 2022-23 season, confirming its evaluation and use as a quadrivalent vaccine, which is necessary context for understanding its comparison in clinical trials."

      "quote": "efficacy trial conducted among 4,514 children aged \u22652 to <18 years over three influenza seasons (Southern Hemisphere 2017 and Northern Hemisphere 2017-18 and 2018 19 (129). Subsequently, in October 2021, FDA approved Flu cel vax Quad rival ent for persons aged \u22656 months. Approval was based on a randomized immunogen i city and safety study conducted among 2,402 children aged 6 through 47 months (of whom 894 were aged 6 through 23 months). Children were randomized n a 2:1 ratio to receive either Flu cel vax Quad rival ent (0.5 mL/dose containing 15 \u00b5g HA per virus for all ages) or a licensed comparator egg based IIV4 (0.25 mL/dose containing 7.5 \u00b5g HA per virus for those aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL/dose containing 15 \u00b5g HA per virus for those aged 36 through 47 months) (130). Flu cel vax Quad rival ent met pre specified immunogen i city criteria for all four viruses. No new safety signals were noted, and prevalence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions was similar between the two groups.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides a direct example of a pivotal trial design in which a quadrivalent vaccine (Flu cel vax Quadrivalent) was evaluated against a licensed comparator quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine, supporting the claim's context and methodology. While this example is for Flu cel vax, it demonstrates the standard approach for pivotal trials, which is relevant to the claim about Flublok Quadrivalent."
