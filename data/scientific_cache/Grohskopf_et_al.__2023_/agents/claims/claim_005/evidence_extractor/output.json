      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total). Contra indications and Precautions for the Use of RIV4. RIV4 is contra indicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of RIV4.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This passage explicitly identifies Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) as a recombinant influenza vaccine and provides its administration details, confirming its evaluation and use as a distinct vaccine type in the 2022-23 season."

      "quote": "Children were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Flu cel vax Quadrivalent (0.5 mL/dose containing 15 \u00b5g HA per virus for all ages) or a licensed comparator egg based IIV4 (0.25 mL/dose containing 7.5 \u00b5g HA per virus for those aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL/dose containing 15 \u00b5g HA per virus for those aged 36 through 47 months) (130). Flu cel vax Quadrivalent met pre specified immunogenicity criteria for all four viruses. No new safety signals were noted, and prevalence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions was similar between the two groups.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes a pivotal trial in which a quadrivalent vaccine (Flu cel vax Quadrivalent) was directly compared to a licensed comparator egg-based IIV4, demonstrating the evaluation of one quadrivalent vaccine against another standard quadrivalent vaccine in a randomized clinical trial."
