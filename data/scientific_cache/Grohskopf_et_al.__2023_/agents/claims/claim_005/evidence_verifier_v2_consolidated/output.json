HD-IIV3 was more effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or culture confirmed influenza like illness (ILI) in a two season randomized study conducted among 32 000 persons aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 24%; 95% CI: 10 36; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single season randomized trials of RIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 that assessed culture confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 that examined PCR-confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged \u226565 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: \u221217% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate). The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged \u226550 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10 47 as well i lfi d ILI h d 65",

      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that a randomized trial compared RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) with a nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine) and examined PCR-confirmed influenza-like illness. Fluarix Quadrivalent is a standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4, and the document's Table 1 confirms it is one of the SD-IIV4s. Therefore, the quote directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) or an equivalent SD-IIV4.",
