The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged \u226550 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10\u201347 as well as in a qualified ILI endpoint among those aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 42%; 95% CI: 9%\u201365%) (68).",

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It describes a randomized trial comparing RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) to nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4, which is the category that includes Fluarix Quadrivalent. The document's Table 1 (page 5) confirms that Fluarix Quadrivalent is a standard-dose, nonadjuvanted, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4). Therefore, the quote substantiates that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in a pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) or an equivalent vaccine in that category.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 14 of the document, in the section discussing randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs.
