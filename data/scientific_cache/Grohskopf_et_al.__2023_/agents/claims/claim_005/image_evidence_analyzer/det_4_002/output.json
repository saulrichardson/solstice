  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing characteristics of various quadrivalent influenza vaccines, including trade names (e.g., Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent), presentations, age indications, HA antigen content per dose, administration route, and thimerosal content. Evidence: The table lists Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA vaccine) and Fluarix Quadrivalent (egg-based standard-dose vaccine) as separate entries but provides no information on comparative or pivotal trial evaluation between them. The table does not support the claim because it merely lists Flublok and Fluarix as distinct vaccines without indicating that Flublok was evaluated against Fluarix in a pivotal trial, and thus does not support the claim Note: Table excerpt only shows product specifications; no trial design or comparator data are included.",
