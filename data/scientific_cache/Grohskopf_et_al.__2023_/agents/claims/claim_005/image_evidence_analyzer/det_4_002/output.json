  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table from a CDC/ACIP document listing characteristics of US\u2010licensed 2022\u201323 influenza vaccines. Columns include vaccine name (e.g., Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent), presentation (e.g., 0.5\u2010mL prefilled syringe), age indication, hemagglutinin content per dose, route of administration, and adjuvant information. The table only provides vaccine product specifications (presentations, dosages, age indications) and does not include any study data or mention a pivotal trial comparing Flublok Quadrivalent to Fluarix Quadrivalent; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Portions of the table are truncated and no trial comparison data are visible.",
