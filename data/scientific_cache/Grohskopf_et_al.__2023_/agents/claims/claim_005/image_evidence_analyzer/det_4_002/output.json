  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-column table listing various licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines by vaccine type (e.g., standard-dose egg-based IIV4, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, high-dose HD-IIV4, adjuvanted aIIV4, recombinant HA RIV4, live attenuated LAIV4). For each product it shows trade name, manufacturer, presentation (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe), approved age indication, hemagglutinin content per strain (\u00b5g HA or virus count), route of administration, and mercury content if present. The table only provides product specifications for Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluarix Quadrivalent but contains no information about a pivotal clinical trial or direct comparison between the two vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible table content; no trial design or comparator details are present in the image.",
