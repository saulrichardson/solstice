  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing currently licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines by category (standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose, adjuvanted, recombinant HA, and live-attenuated intranasal), showing trade name (manufacturer), presentation volume, age indication, HA content per dose, route of administration, and mercury content. The table merely catalogues Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluarix Quadrivalent as separate licensed vaccines with their formulations and indications; it does not present any data or mention a pivotal trial directly comparing Flublok to Fluarix, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to a single table page that does not include study design or comparator information.",
