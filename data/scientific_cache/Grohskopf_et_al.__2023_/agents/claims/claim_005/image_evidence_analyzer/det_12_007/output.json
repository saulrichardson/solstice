  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing trade names and manufacturers of various quadrivalent influenza vaccines (Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent) alongside their dose volumes and HA content for children aged 6 through 35 months. The table does not mention Flublok (quadrivalent) nor any comparison against Fluarix (quadrivalent). Thus, the image does not support the claim. Note: The table only covers pediatric dose volumes for specific manufacturers and does not include Flublok, limiting its relevance to the claim.",
