  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing trade names and manufacturers of quadrivalent influenza vaccines and their dose volumes (\u00b5g HA per vaccine virus) for children aged 6 through 35 months, including Afluria Quadrivalent (Seqirus), Fluarix Quadrivalent (GlaxoSmithKline), Flucelvax Quadrivalent (Seqirus), FluLaval Quadrivalent (GlaxoSmithKline), and Fluzone Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur), with corresponding dose volumes. The table only provides pediatric dose volumes for listed quadrivalent influenza vaccines and does not mention Flublok or any comparison trial against Fluarix. Therefore, this evidence does not support the claim. Note: Analysis based solely on visible table content; no mention of Flublok or pivotal trial comparisons.",
