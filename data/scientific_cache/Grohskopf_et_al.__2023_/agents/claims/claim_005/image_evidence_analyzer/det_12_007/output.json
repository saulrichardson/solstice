  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing trade names of quadrivalent influenza vaccines (Afluria, Fluarix, Flucelvax, FluLaval, Fluzone) alongside their dose volumes (\u00b5g HA per virus) for children aged 6 through 35 months. The table only presents pediatric dosing information for several quadrivalent vaccines and makes no mention of Flublok or any pivotal trial comparing Flublok to Fluarix; it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but only addresses pediatric dosing, not trial design or vaccine comparisons.",
