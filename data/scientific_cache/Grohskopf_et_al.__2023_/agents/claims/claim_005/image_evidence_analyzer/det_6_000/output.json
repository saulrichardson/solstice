  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing contraindications and precautions for different 2022\u201323 influenza vaccines (egg-based IIVs and LAIV4, cell culture\u2013based quadrivalent [ccIIV4], and recombinant quadrivalent [RIV4]) in individuals with previous severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to various vaccine types. The table only provides guidance on contraindications and precautions for different influenza vaccine formats based on allergic history. It does not mention any pivotal trial or a comparison between Flublok (RIV4) and Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but contains no information on clinical trial design or comparators.",
