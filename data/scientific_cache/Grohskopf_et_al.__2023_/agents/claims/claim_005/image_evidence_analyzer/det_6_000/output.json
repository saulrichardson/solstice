  "explanation": "Table listing contraindications and precautions for various influenza vaccines (egg-based IIV or LAIV, cell culture\u2013based IIV including quadrivalent ccIIV4, live attenuated influenza vaccine, recombinant influenza vaccine) with accompanying abbreviations and notes. The table provides contraindication and precaution details for different influenza vaccine formulations but contains no information about a pivotal trial comparing Flublok (quadrivalent) to Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), and therefore does not support the claim.",
