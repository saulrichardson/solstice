  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A clinical guidance table listing contraindications and precautions for influenza vaccines in the 2022\u201323 season, organized by prior severe allergic reaction to any egg-based IIV or LAIV, any ccIIV, any RIV, or unknown influenza vaccine, and showing actions for egg-based IIVs/LAIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4. The table addresses allergy-related contraindications and precautions for different influenza vaccine platforms and does not mention any pivotal trial comparing Flublok (quadrivalent) with Fluarix (quadrivalent). Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Table is focused on safety guidance for hypersensitivity and does not include trial design or comparator information.
