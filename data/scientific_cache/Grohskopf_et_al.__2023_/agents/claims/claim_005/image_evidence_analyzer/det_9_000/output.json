  "explanation": "A flowchart showing pediatric influenza vaccination dosing recommendations: a decision box asking if the child received \u22652 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, 2022, leading to either 1 dose of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine if yes, or 2 doses (\u22654 weeks apart) of 2022\u201323 influenza vaccine if no or unknown. The figure is a dosing guideline flowchart and does not provide any information about a clinical trial or comparisons between Flublok (quadrivalent) and Fluarix (quadrivalent).
