  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A flowchart outlining influenza vaccination recommendations for children aged 6 months through 8 years during the 2022\u201323 season, showing decision nodes based on whether one or two doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine were received before July 1, 2022, and recommending either 1 or 2 doses administered \u22654 weeks apart. The image is a dosing decision flowchart and does not include any information about a pivotal trial comparing Flublok (quadrivalent) with Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), and thus does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clearly legible and complete for its topic (pediatric dosing), but it contains no mention of Flublok or Fluarix or trial comparisons.",
