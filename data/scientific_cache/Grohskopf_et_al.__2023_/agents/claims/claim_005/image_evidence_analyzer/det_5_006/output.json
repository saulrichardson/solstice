  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing four vaccine types (Egg-based IIV4s, ccIIV4, RIV4, and LAIV4) alongside their contraindications and precautions. The table provides safety-related contraindications and precautions for various influenza vaccines (including RIV4, the recombinant quadrivalent vaccine), but contains no information about a pivotal trial or comparison between Flublok (RIV4) and Fluarix; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible; however, it focuses solely on safety contraindications and precautions and does not address clinical trial design or comparator vaccines.",
