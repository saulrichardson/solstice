  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing contraindications and precautions for various quadrivalent influenza vaccines, including cell culture\u2013based inactivated vaccine (ccIIV4), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), adjuvanted inactivated vaccine (aIIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4). The table provides safety contraindications and precautions for RIV4 (Flublok) and other vaccines but contains no information about any pivotal trial or head-to-head comparison against Fluarix; thus it does not support the claim.",
