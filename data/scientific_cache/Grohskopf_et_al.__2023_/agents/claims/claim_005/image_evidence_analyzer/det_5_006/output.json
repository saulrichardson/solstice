  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing vaccine types (Egg-based IIV4s, ccIIV4, RIV4, LAIV4) alongside their contraindications and precautions. The table only provides safety information (contraindications and precautions) for various influenza vaccines including RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent). It does not mention Fluarix or any pivotal trial comparisons, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible; no trial or comparator vaccine data are present.",
