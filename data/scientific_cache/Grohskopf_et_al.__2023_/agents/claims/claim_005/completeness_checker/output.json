      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total). Contra indications and Precautions for the Use of RIV4. RIV4 is contra indicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of RIV4.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This passage explicitly identifies Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) as a recombinant influenza vaccine and provides its administration details, confirming its evaluation and use as a distinct vaccine type in the 2022-23 season."

      "quote": "Children were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Flu cel vax Quadrivalent (0.5 mL/dose containing 15 \u00b5g HA per virus for all ages) or a licensed comparator egg based IIV4 (0.25 mL/dose containing 7.5 \u00b5g HA per virus for those aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL/dose containing 15 \u00b5g HA per virus for those aged 36 through 47 months) (130). Flu cel vax Quadrivalent met pre specified immunogenicity criteria for all four viruses. No new safety signals were noted, and prevalence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions was similar between the two groups.",

      "quote": "Randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory confirmed influenza illness are few in number and were conducted over few influenza seasons. HD-IIV3 was more effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or culture confirmed influenza like illness (ILI) in a two season randomized study conducted among 32 000 persons aged \u226565 years (relative efficacy: 24%; 95% CI: 10 36; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single season randomized trials of RIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 that assessed culture confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 that examined PCR-confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged \u226565 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: \u221217% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate). The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged \u226550 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10 47 as well i lfi d ILI h d 65",
