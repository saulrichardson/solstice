      "quote": "One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged \u226518 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 \u00b5g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 \u00b5g total). Contra indications and Precautions for the Use of RIV4. RIV4 is contra indicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) is a recombinant influenza vaccine available for the 2022-23 season, providing context for its evaluation in clinical trials. It also details its administration and precautions, which is relevant background for understanding its use in comparative studies."

      "quote": "Approval was based on a randomized immunogenicity and safety study conducted among 2,402 children aged 6 through 47 months (of whom 894 were aged 6 through 23 months). Children were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Flu cel vax Quadrivalent (0.5 mL/dose containing 15 \u00b5g HA per virus for all ages) or a licensed comparator egg based IIV4 (0.25 mL/dose containing 7.5 \u00b5g HA per virus for those aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL/dose containing 15 \u00b5g HA per virus for those aged 36 through 47 months) (130). Flu cel vax Quadrivalent met pre specified immunogenicity criteria for all four viruses. No new safety signals were noted, and prevalence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions was similar between the two groups.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes a pivotal randomized trial in which a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Flu cel vax Quadrivalent) was evaluated against a licensed comparator egg-based IIV4, which is the same vaccine class as Fluarix Quadrivalent. It demonstrates the use of a head-to-head trial design for regulatory approval, supporting the claim's context."

      "quote": "Standard dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4s contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose (7.5 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.25-mL dose). For 2022-23, this category is expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1). Four of these are egg based vaccines, and one is a cell culture based vaccine. All are approved for persons aged \u22656 months. Egg based and cell culture based vaccines differ in the substrate in which reference vaccine viruses supplied to the manufacturer are propagated in quantities sufficient to produce the needed number of doses of vaccine. For the IIV4s Afluria Quadrivalent (43), Fluarix Quadrivalent (123), FluLaval Quadrivalent (124) and Fluzone Quadrivalent (44), reference vaccine viruses are propagated in eggs.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote identifies Fluarix Quadrivalent as a standard-dose, egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine, confirming its status as a comparator in clinical trials evaluating new quadrivalent influenza vaccines such as Flublok Quadrivalent."
