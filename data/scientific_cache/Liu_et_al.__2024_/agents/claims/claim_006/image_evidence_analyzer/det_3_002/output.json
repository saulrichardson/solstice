  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing geometric mean microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination in two age cohorts (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) against four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Each panel compares four vaccine groups: Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4. This figure presents immunogenicity data comparing antibody responses for different vaccine formulations, including the recombinant vaccine RIV4, but it does not describe or mention the production method (BEVS in insect cells) for Flublok, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; production details are not included in the immunogenicity data.",
