  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A grid of sixteen dot-and-whisker plots showing neutralizing microneutralization (MN) titers (log2 scale) for A(H3N2) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (log2 scale) for A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains measured at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years) against egg-derived and cell-derived viruses. Four vaccine groups are compared: Fluzone IIV4 (egg-based), Fluarix IIV4 (egg-based), cell-based IIV4 (cIIV4), and recombinant IIV4 (RIV4). P-values for differences between groups are annotated above select comparisons. The figure presents immunogenicity data comparing different influenza vaccines but does not describe the production platform or the use of recombinant HA expression in insect cells via a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS); therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to identify vaccine groups and assay types, but no manufacturing details are provided.",
