  "explanation": "Multi\u2010panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) against four influenza virus strains (A(H3N2), H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post\u2010vaccination. Four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) are compared with individual data points, geometric mean titers, and p-value annotations. A detailed caption below lists group sizes and assays used. does not support the claim because the figure presents immunogenicity data only and contains no information on the production platform or use of insect cells and BEVS for Flublok. Note: The figure focuses exclusively on antibody responses and does not address vaccine manufacturing methods; text is legible and complete for its scope.",
