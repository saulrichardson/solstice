  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram showing enrollment, randomization, and follow-up of study participants over two influenza seasons (2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020), with branches indicating allocation to four vaccine groups in Year 1 (ccIIV4, RIV4, Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4) and re-randomization in Year 2, along with participant numbers at each stage. The figure is a participant flowchart detailing study enrollment and vaccine allocation; it does not describe or mention production methods, insect cells, or a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The diagram is clear but only covers clinical trial enrollment and allocation; there are no manufacturing or platform details present.",
