  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram depicting Year 2 (2019\u20132020) participant re-enrollment and randomization into vaccine groups: IIV4 (inactivated influenza vaccine), ccIIV4 (cell-culture based inactivated influenza vaccine), and RIV4 (recombinant-hemagglutinin influenza vaccine, Flublok\u00ae Quadrivalent). Boxes show numbers enrolled, excluded, and assigned to each vaccine sequence. The figure only shows participant enrollment and vaccine group labels, defining RIV4 as a recombinant-hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (Flublok\u00ae Quadrivalent). It does not mention production in insect cells or use of a baculovirus expression vector system, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but lacks any detail on production platform, cell type, or BEVS methodology.",
