  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram showing enrollment and randomization of participants (n=723 in Year 1 and n=684 in Year 2) into different influenza vaccine groups: cell-culture IIV4 (ccIIV4), recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4), Fluzone IIV4, and Fluarix IIV4, with re-randomizations, exclusions, and group sizes detailed. The image is solely a CONSORT diagram of participant allocation and does not support the claim regarding Flublok\u2019s production platform or the use of a baculovirus expression vector system. Note: The image contains no information on vaccine production methods or platforms; it only details trial enrollment and randomization.",
