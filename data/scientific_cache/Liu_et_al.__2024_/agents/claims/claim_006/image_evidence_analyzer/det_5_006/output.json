  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) against egg-derived and cell-derived hemagglutinin (HA) from various influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM) in subjects vaccinated with four formulations: Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4. Panel B shows geometric mean ratios of egg- to cell-derived HA ELISA titers, Panel C shows HA stalk titers over time, and Panel D shows fold-rise in stalk titers at 1 month relative to baseline. The figure presents immunogenicity data comparing antibody responses to different HA antigens across vaccine products, but it does not include any information on manufacturing processes or expression systems. Therefore, it does not support the claim about Flublok\u2019s production using a BEVS in insect cells. Note: Limited by absence of production details or vaccine manufacturing description in the figure; image focuses solely on serological assay results.",
