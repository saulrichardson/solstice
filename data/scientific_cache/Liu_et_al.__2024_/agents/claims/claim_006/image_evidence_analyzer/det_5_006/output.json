  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure displaying ELISA antibody titers (log\u2082 scale) for total HA binding and HA stalk binding at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1\u2009month, and 6\u2009months post-vaccination for four influenza vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4). Panels include comparisons of egg-derived versus cell-derived HA, head versus stalk responses, and fold-rise ratios. The figure presents immunogenicity data (antibody titers and ratios) for various vaccine formulations but does not provide any information on the production platform or recombinant HA expression in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No mention of manufacturing methods or BEVS in the figure; resolution is sufficient to confirm absence of production platform details.",
