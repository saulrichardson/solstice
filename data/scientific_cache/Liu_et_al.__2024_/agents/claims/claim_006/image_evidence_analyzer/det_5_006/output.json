  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure presenting ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) against egg-grown and cell-grown viral HA antigens (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM) over time (Day 0, 1 month, 6 months) for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4), plus panels showing geometric mean ratios of egg vs cell HA titers, stalk-domain ELISA titers, and HA stalk ELISA fold-rise. The figure presents immunogenicity data comparing ELISA titers for different influenza vaccines but contains no information on manufacturing methods, insect cell expression, or baculovirus vectors, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear but focuses solely on immune response data, not production platform details.",
