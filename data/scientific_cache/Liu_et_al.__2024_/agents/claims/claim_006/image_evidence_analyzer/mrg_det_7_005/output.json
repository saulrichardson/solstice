  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure displaying hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) against influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata at Day 0 and one month post-vaccination for various vaccine arms, with geometric mean titers, 95% confidence intervals, gray dots for individual titers, and p-values indicating statistical comparisons. The figure presents immunogenicity (HI antibody response) data for different influenza vaccines and does not include any information on Flublok\u2019s production platform or expression of recombinant HA in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image is legible and detailed for serological results but contains no text or labels regarding production methods or BEVS.",
