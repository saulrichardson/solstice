  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Figure with panels A\u2013D displaying geometric mean ratios of egg-to-cell virus titers (95% CI) and proportions of \u22654-fold reduced titers pre- and post-vaccination for four influenza vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) across influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM) in two age groups (18\u201344, 45\u201364 years). does not support the claim because the image shows immunogenicity comparisons including RIV4 but provides no information on production platform, BEVS, or insect-cell expression of recombinant HA Note: No production or manufacturing details are visible in the figure; content is limited to virological assay results.",
