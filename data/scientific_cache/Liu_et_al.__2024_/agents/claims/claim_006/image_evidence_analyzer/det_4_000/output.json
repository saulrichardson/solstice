  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",

  "explanation": "Four-panel graph comparing geometric mean fold rise of antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and fold reduction at 6 months post-vaccination (panels C and D) among adults aged 18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years. The data show results for four vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) against egg- and cell-propagated H3N2, H1N1, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains with p-values for pairwise comparisons. The figure provides immunogenicity data for RIV4 versus egg- and cell-derived vaccines but does not include any information about the production platform, recombinant expression, insect cells, or baculovirus vector system; therefore it doesn't support the claim Note: Text is small but clear enough to see that no production method details are provided",
