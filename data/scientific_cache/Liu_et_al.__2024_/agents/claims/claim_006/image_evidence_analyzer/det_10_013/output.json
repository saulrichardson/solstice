  "explanation": "A table summarizing demographic characteristics and influenza vaccination history of study participants across four groups (n=122, n=120, n=283, n=198), including mean age, age group distribution, sex, race/ethnicity, study site, and prior vaccination history. The table presents participant demographics and vaccination history but does not mention Flublok\u2019s production platform, recombinant HA expression, insect cells, or baculovirus expression vector system, and thus does not support the claim.",
