  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two-panel figure (panels A and B) showing pre- and post-vaccination hemagglutination inhibition titers or proportions of \u22654-fold titer rise against influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). Multiple vaccine sequences are compared (ccIIV4, RIV4, IIV4, Fluzone combinations). The figure presents immunogenicity outcomes for different vaccine regimens but does not include any information on Flublok's production platform or the use of baculovirus expression in insect cells, so it does not support the claim.",
