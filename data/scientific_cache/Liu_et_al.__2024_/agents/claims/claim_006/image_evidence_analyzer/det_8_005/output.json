  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two-panel figure showing pre- and post-vaccination hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay responses (proportion \u22654-fold titer rise) against four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years, 45\u201364 years). Multiple vaccine groups are compared (cell culture\u2013based quadrivalent IIV, recombinant IIV [RIV4], egg-based IIV including Fluzone) with distinct marker symbols and colored lines. does not support the claim because the figure presents immunogenicity data and vaccine group comparisons but provides no information on Flublok\u2019s production platform or use of baculovirus expression in insect cells Note: Figure is clear but contains no manufacturing or expression system details",
