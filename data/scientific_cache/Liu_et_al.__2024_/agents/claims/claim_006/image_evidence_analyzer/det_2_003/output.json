  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing egg-adapted amino acid substitutions in influenza vaccine viruses from various sources (egg-based candidate vaccine viruses, cell culture\u2013derived vaccine viruses) across different strains and years. does not support the claim because the table focuses on egg- and cell-based vaccine virus sequence adaptations and makes no reference to Flublok or production in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system. Note: No mention of Flublok or BEVS in the visible content; image quality sufficient for reading text.",
