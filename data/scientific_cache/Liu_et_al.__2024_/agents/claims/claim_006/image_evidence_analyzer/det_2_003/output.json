  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza virus strains (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) and showing amino acid differences at specific HA head domain positions for cell- and egg-propagated candidate vaccine viruses across years. does not support the claim because the table only presents amino acid sequence differences for influenza HA from various cell- and egg-propagated candidate vaccine viruses, with no mention of Flublok, insect cells, or a baculovirus expression vector system. Note: The table is clear and legible but contains only sequence variation data; no production platform information is provided.",
