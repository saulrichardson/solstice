  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza virus strains (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, B/Yamagata lineages) and the amino acid differences in the HA head domain for cell-derived versus egg-derived candidate vaccine viruses across multiple years. The table does not support the claim because it contains only sequence comparisons of HA amino acid differences between cell- and egg-derived influenza seed viruses and makes no mention of Flublok, recombinant HA, insect cells, or a baculovirus expression vector system, so it doesn't support the claim.
