  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A portion of a journal article page showing introductory text on influenza vaccination methods (egg-based, cell-based vaccines), study details on repeat vaccination and antibody responses, and general background about inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV). No table specific to Flublok is visible. The image does not support the claim because it does not mention Flublok or describe its recombinant HA production in insect cells using a BEVS; it doesn\u2019t support the claim. Note: The image quality and partial view may obscure some elements, but no relevant information on Flublok or BEVS is visible.",
