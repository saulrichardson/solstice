  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) to HA head and stalk regions for H3N2, pH1N1, B/VIC, and B/YAM strains at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination across seven different repeat vaccination arms (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-IIV4), plus fold-rise and ratio plots with 95% confidence intervals and p values. The figure presents immunogenicity data (ELISA titers) for various vaccine regimens but contains no information on vaccine manufacturing methods or production platforms. It does not support the claim that Flublok is produced using a BEVS in insect cells.",
