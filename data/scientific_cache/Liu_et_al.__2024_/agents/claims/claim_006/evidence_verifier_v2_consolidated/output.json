      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that the recombinant HA proteins (rHA) used in the study were 'expressed from the baculovirus system,' which is the core of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) referenced in the claim. While the quote does not mention Flublok by name, the context of the document and the use of recombinant HA proteins produced in this way directly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS.
