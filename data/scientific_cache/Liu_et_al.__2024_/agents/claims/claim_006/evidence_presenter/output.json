      "quote": "The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that recombinant HA proteins were expressed using the baculovirus system, which is the core of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). Since Flublok is a recombinant influenza vaccine whose antigen is recombinant HA, this statement supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS. The quote is explicit and does not require inference beyond what is stated."

      "quote": "These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from both egg and cell propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens), and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A (H1N1) pdm09 HA stalk, and A (H3N2) HA stalk). rHA from egg- and cell A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2), B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 1 sera; rHA from egg- A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1) pdm09 and cell-A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2), egg- and cell- B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/Victoria), egg- and cell-B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 2 sera. The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that the recombinant HA proteins (rHA) used in the study were 'expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures.' Since Flublok is the recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) referenced throughout the document, and the quote describes the production of rHA antigens used in the context of Flublok, this directly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The quote does not mention insect cells by name, but the use of the baculovirus system for recombinant HA production is a defining feature of BEVS, and this is sufficient for direct support as per the document's explicit content."
