    {
      "quote": "These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from both egg and cell propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens), and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk, and A (H3 N2) HA stalk). rHA from egg- and cell A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1 N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3 N2), B/ Colorado 06 2017 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 1 sera; rHA from egg- A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1 N1) pdm09 and cell-A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1 N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3 N2), egg- and cell- B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/ Victoria), egg- and cell-B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 2 sera. The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that the recombinant HA proteins (rHA) used in the study were 'expressed from the baculovirus system,' which is the core of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) referenced in the claim. While the quote does not mention Flublok by name, the context of the document and the use of recombinant HA proteins produced in this way directly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS. No inference beyond the explicit statement about the baculovirus system is required."

This supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS. While the quote does not explicitly mention 'insect cells,' the use of the baculovirus system for recombinant HA production is a defining feature of BEVS, and the context of the document (discussing Flublok and RIV4) makes it clear that this is the method being referenced. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim."
