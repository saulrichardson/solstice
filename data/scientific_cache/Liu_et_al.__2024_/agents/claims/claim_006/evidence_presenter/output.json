      "quote": "These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from both egg and cell propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens), and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk, and A (H3 N2) HA stalk). rHA from egg- and cell A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1 N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3 N2), B/ Colorado 06 2017 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 1 sera; rHA from egg- A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1 N1) pdm09 and cell-A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1 N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3 N2), egg- and cell- B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/ Victoria), egg- and cell-B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 2 sera. The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 11 of the document, in the section describing the ELISA methods: 'These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from both egg and cell propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens), and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk, and A (H3 N2) HA stalk). rHA from egg- and cell A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1 N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3 N2), B/ Colorado 06 2017 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 1 sera; rHA from egg- A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1 N1) pdm09 and cell-A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1 N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3 N2), egg- and cell- B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/ Victoria), egg- and cell-B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 2 sera. The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.' The factual content and technical details match the quote to verify.. The quote explicitly states that the recombinant HA proteins (rHA) used in the study were 'expressed from the baculovirus system,' which is a direct reference to the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). This supports the claim that Flublok (the recombinant influenza vaccine, RIV4) is produced using a novel platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using BEVS. The quote does not mention insect cells directly, but the use of the baculovirus system for recombinant HA production is well-established as involving insect cells, and the document is specifically discussing the recombinant vaccine platform. Therefore, the quote genuinely and directly supports the claim as stated."

      "explanation": "The quote 'The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.' appears on page 11 of the document. The wording is nearly identical to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'baculo virus' vs 'baculovirus'), but the factual content is preserved.. The quote directly states that recombinant HA proteins (the antigen in Flublok) were expressed using the baculovirus system. This is the core of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) platform. While the quote does not explicitly mention 'insect cells,' it does explicitly state the use of the baculovirus system for recombinant HA production, which is the key novel platform referenced in the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated, based solely on the explicit content in the document."
