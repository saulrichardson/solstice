      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'acell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by SanofiPasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d'. While the sentence is partially obscured by OCR artifacts, it clearly states that RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 3 times the [amount] 45 HA/d[ose]/... compared to the other vaccine. This matches the factual content of the quote to be verified.. The quote explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 3 times the amount of HA (hemagglutinin) per dose, specifically 45 micrograms, compared to standard-dose vaccines (which are known to contain 15 micrograms per strain). This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg in a standard-dose influenza vaccine."

      "quote": "IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody",
      "explanation": "The quote 'IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody' appears on page 9 of the document. The factual content and numbers are preserved, specifically the statement that IIV4 and ccIIV4 contain 15 \u00b5g HA per dose per strain.. The quote directly states that IIV4 and ccIIV4 (standard-dose influenza vaccines) contain 15 \u00b5g HA per dose per strain. This is the comparator for Flublok (RIV4), which is described elsewhere in the document as containing 3 times the amount (i.e., 45 \u00b5g HA per strain). Thus, the quote provides explicit factual support for the claim regarding the HA content of standard-dose influenza vaccines versus Flublok."

The quote explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 3 times the amount of HA (hemagglutinin antigen) per dose compared to standard vaccines, and references '45 HA/d...'
