  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "document": "Liu_et_al.__2024_",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {
      "quote": "acell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim by stating that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 3 times the amount of HA per dose compared to standard-dose vaccines, and references the 45 HA/d (interpreted as 45 micrograms HA per dose per strain). This matches the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg in standard-dose vaccines. The document does not provide the full sentence, but the key facts and numbers are present and unambiguous."

    {
      "quote": "IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that IIV4 and ccIIV4 (standard-dose influenza vaccines) contain 15 \u00b5g HA per dose per strain. This supports the claim's comparison between Flublok (RIV4) and standard-dose vaccines, as the claim asserts that Flublok contains 45 \u00b5g HA per strain versus 15 \u00b5g in standard-dose vaccines. While the quote does not mention the 45 \u00b5g content of Flublok, it provides explicit evidence for the 15 \u00b5g content in standard-dose vaccines, which is a key part of the claim."

RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 3 times the HA (hemagglutinin antigen) content, and the number '45 HA/d' (interpreted as 45 micrograms of HA per dose/strain) is present. Since standard-dose influenza vaccines (IIV4, ccIIV4) are known to contain 15 mcg HA per strain, this statement directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg in standard-dose vaccines. The document does not contradict this, and the numbers and context are preserved."
