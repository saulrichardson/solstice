      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It states that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 3 times the amount of HA per dose compared to standard-dose vaccines, and references '45 HA/d', which aligns with 45 micrograms of HA per strain. Standard-dose influenza vaccines are known to contain 15 micrograms of HA per strain, so 3 times that amount is 45 micrograms, matching the claim. The document does not contradict this and provides the necessary numbers and comparison.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 2 of the document: 'acell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by SanofiPasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d'. While the sentence is partially obscured by OCR artifacts, it clearly states that RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 3 times the amount of HA (hemagglutinin) per dose, and references '45 HA/d', which is consistent with 45 micrograms per dose per strain. This matches the factual content of the quote to be verified.",

      "explanation": "The quote directly states that IIV4 and ccIIV4 (standard-dose influenza vaccines) contain 15 \u00b5g HA per dose per strain. This supports the claim by providing the specific HA content for standard-dose vaccines, which is the basis for comparison with Flublok (RIV4), which is described elsewhere in the document as containing 45 \u00b5g HA per strain. Thus, the quote substantiates the claim's assertion about the HA content in standard-dose influenza vaccines.",
