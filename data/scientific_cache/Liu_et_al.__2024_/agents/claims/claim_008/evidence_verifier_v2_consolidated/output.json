      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim by stating that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 3 times the amount of HA per dose compared to standard-dose vaccines, and references the 45 HA/d (interpreted as 45 micrograms HA per dose per strain). This matches the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg in standard-dose vaccines. The document does not provide the full sentence, but the key facts and numbers are present and unambiguous.",

While the sentence is truncated due to OCR artifacts, it clearly states that RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 3 times the amount of HA (hemagglutinin) per dose, and references '45 HA/d', which is consistent with 45 micrograms of HA per strain per dose. The context is a direct comparison to standard-dose vaccines, which are known to contain 15 mcg HA per strain.",
