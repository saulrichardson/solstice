  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure displaying hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (Log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination in 18\u201344 and 45\u201364\u2009year age groups, for egg virus and cell virus assays. Each panel shows color-coded groups representing different vaccine formulations (cell culture\u2013derived IIV4, recombinant RIV4, standard IIV4) with GMTs and p-values for comparisons. does not support the claim because the figure presents immunogenicity (HI titer) data and contains no information on the HA microgram content per strain in Flublok or standard-dose vaccines",
