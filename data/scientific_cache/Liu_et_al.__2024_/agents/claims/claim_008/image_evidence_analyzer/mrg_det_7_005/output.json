  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Grid of twelve plots showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (Log2 scale) for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years) and two virus sources (egg virus and cell virus) at Day 0 and one month post-vaccination, comparing multiple vaccine regimens with colored markers and annotated p-values. This figure presents immunogenicity (HI titer) data and does not include any information on HA antigen content per strain for Flublok or standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is legible and clearly focuses on antibody responses rather than antigen dosing; no dosage details are present.",
