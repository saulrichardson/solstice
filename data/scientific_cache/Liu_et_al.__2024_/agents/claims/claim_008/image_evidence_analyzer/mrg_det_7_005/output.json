  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010panel figure of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post\u2010vaccination against A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains. Seven repeat vaccination arms (ccIIV4, RIV4, IIV4 in various sequences) are compared by geometric mean titers with 95% confidence intervals and p\u2010value annotations. does not support the claim because the figure presents HI antibody response data across vaccine sequences and does not include any information on HA microgram content per strain for Flublok or standard\u2010dose vaccines.",
