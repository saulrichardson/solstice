  "explanation": "CONSORT flow diagram showing enrollment, randomization, and follow-up of participants in a two-year influenza vaccine study (Year 1: allocation to ccIIV4, RIV4, Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4; Year 2: re-randomization pathways). does not support the claim because the image is a participant flowchart and contains no information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per vaccine strain.
