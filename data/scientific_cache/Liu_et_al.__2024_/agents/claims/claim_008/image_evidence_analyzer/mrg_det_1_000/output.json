  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram showing screening and enrollment of participants in Year 2 of a clinical trial, with branches for IIV4 (inactivated influenza vaccine), ccIIV4 (cell culture\u2013based inactivated influenza vaccine), and RIV4 (recombinant-hemagglutinin influenza vaccine, Flublok), including numbers randomized and excluded. The figure presents participant flow and randomization details for different vaccine groups but provides no information on hemagglutinin microgram content per strain; it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for participant flow but lacks dosing information.",
