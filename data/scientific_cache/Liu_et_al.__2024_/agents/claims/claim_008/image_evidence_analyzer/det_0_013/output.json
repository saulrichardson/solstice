  "explanation": "A partial page from a medical article showing narrative text about influenza vaccination, immunogenicity, and study design; no clear table content with antigen doses is visible. The visible content does not mention antigen quantities per strain and therefore does not support the claim Note: The image is cut off and does not show any table rows or columns specifying HA micrograms per strain, limiting the ability to find relevant evidence",
