  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A four-panel figure (A\u2013D) displaying immunogenicity outcomes in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years) for four influenza vaccines (egg-based IIV4 vaccines Fluzone and Fluarix, cell-culture based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) against A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains, showing geometric mean ratios and proportions achieving \u22654-fold titer changes with p-values. does not support the claim because the figure presents only immunogenicity data and contains no information on hemagglutinin microgram content per strain for Flublok or standard vaccines Note: No HA dosage information is present in the image",
