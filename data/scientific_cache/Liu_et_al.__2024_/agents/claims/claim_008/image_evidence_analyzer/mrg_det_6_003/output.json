  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing geometric mean ratios of egg/cell virus titers and proportions of \u22654-fold reduced titers for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) across two age cohorts (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). The figure presents immunogenicity measurements such as GMT ratios and fold-change proportions but contains no information on hemagglutinin microgram content per strain; it does not support the claim. Note: No antigen dosage data are provided in the image.",
