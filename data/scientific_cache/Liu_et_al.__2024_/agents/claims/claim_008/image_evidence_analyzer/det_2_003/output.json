  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table listing influenza vaccine virus strains (e.g., A/Michigan/45/2015, A/Singapore/INFIMH\u201016\u20100019/2016, B/Colorado/06/2017, etc.) with columns showing cell\u2010derived vs egg\u2010derived candidate vaccine viruses and specific HA amino acid substitutions (including glycosylation motif changes). The table provides sequence and egg-adaptation details for various influenza vaccine viruses and does not include any information on HA microgram dosage per strain, so it does not support the claim about Flublok containing 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg in standard-dose vaccine. Note: The image is clear and fully legible; no dosage information is present.",
