  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza virus strains (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria lineage, B/Yamagata lineage), with rows for Year 1 and Year 2 viruses and columns showing amino acid differences at specific HA head domain positions. The table details amino acid substitutions in the HA head domain of different influenza strains and does not present any information about HA microgram content per vaccine strain, so it does not support the claim.",
