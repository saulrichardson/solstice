  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table listing influenza virus strains (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria lineage, B/Yamagata lineage) by year and growth method (cell or egg) alongside amino acid residues at specific HA head domain positions. The table presents amino acid sequence differences in HA head domain residues for various influenza strains and does not mention HA antigen content in micrograms or compare Flublok versus standard\u2010dose vaccine dosages, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and complete for sequence data but contains no dosage information; confidence in non\u2010support is high.",
