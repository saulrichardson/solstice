  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Graphical comparison of proportions of participants with \u22654-fold reduction in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers to cell vaccine virus, shown for pre- and post-vaccination time points across four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Multiple vaccine sequences are represented (ccIIV4, RIV4, IIV4, Fluzone IIV4) according to the legend. The figure presents immunogenicity data (HI titer changes) and does not include any information on HA microgram dosing per strain, therefore it does not support the claim Note: No vaccine dosage or HA content information is displayed in the figure",
