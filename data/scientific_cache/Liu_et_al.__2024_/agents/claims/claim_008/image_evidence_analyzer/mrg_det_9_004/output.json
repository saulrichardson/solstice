  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (Log\u2082 scale) against egg-derived HA, cell-derived HA, and HA stalk domains at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination for various prime-boost combinations of cell culture-based, recombinant (RIV4/Flublok), and egg-based (IIV4) influenza vaccines. Panels also include geometric mean ratios of egg/cell HA ELISA titers and stalk ELISA fold-rise. The figure presents immunogenicity data (ELISA titers) across different vaccine combinations but does not provide any information on the microgram content of HA per strain in Flublok or standard-dose influenza vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: No dosing or formulation details are shown; image quality appears sufficient but dosage information is absent.",
