  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA titers (log2 scale) for HA head and stalk antibody responses against H3N2, H1pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata measured at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination in seven different prime-boost vaccine arms (cell-based quadrivalent IIV4, recombinant RIV4, egg-based IIV4 in various combinations), plus geometric mean ratios and fold-rise of stalk titers. The figure presents immunogenicity data (ELISA titers) for different vaccine formulations but does not report the HA antigen dose (micrograms per strain) for Flublok or standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim.",
