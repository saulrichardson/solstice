  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise of microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and fold reduction at 6 months post-vaccination (panels C and D) for four influenza vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) across different influenza strains (H3N2 egg, H3N2 cell, H1N1 egg, H1N1 cell, B/VIC egg, B/VIC cell, B/YAM egg, B/YAM cell) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). The figure presents immune response data (antibody titer fold rises and reductions) and does not mention or display hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain; therefore, it does not support the claim regarding HA microgram amounts. Note: The image is clear and complete for immunogenicity data but contains no information on vaccine formulation or HA dosage.",
