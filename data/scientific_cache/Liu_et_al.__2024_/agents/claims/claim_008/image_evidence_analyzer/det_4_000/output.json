  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image is a multi-panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise (1 month post-vaccination) and geometric mean fold reduction (6 months post-vaccination) in antibody titers against various influenza strains (H3N2 egg, H3N2 cell, H1N1 egg, H1N1 cell, B/Victoria egg, B/Victoria cell, B/Yamagata egg, B/Yamagata cell) for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Each panel plots mean titer values with 95% CIs and p-values comparing RIV4 to other vaccines. does not support the claim because the figure presents immunogenicity (antibody titer) data and does not show or state the HA microgram dosage per strain for Flublok or standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
