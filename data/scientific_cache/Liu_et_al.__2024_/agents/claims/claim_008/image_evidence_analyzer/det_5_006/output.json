  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multipanel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) against egg-derived and cell-derived HA for influenza A (H3N2, H1N1pdm09) and B (Victoria, Yamagata) strains at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination, plus HA stalk-specific titers and egg/cell HA titer ratios, comparing four vaccine groups labeled Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4. The figure presents immunogenicity data and does not provide any information on HA microgram content per strain, therefore it does not support the claim",
