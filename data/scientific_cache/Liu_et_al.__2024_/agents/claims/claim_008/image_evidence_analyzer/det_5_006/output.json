  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) against egg-derived and cell-derived HA antigens for influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and B (Victoria and Yamagata lineages) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination, plus ELISA stalk titers and ratio/fold-rise plots comparing four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4). This figure presents immunogenicity data (ELISA antibody titers) and does not provide any information on the HA antigen content (micrograms per strain) in Flublok or standard-dose influenza vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete; however, it lacks any dosing or formulation details regarding microgram amounts of HA.",
