  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure presenting ELISA-measured antibody responses for four influenza vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluad IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4). Panels A and C show log-scale antibody titers against egg-derived and cell-derived HA and HA stalk antigens for A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, and B/YAM at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination. Panel B displays geometric mean ratios of egg versus cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month. Panel D shows geometric mean fold-rise in stalk ELISA titers from Day 0 to 1 month. Statistical comparisons among vaccine groups are indicated. The figure displays immunogenicity (antibody titer) data and statistical comparisons across vaccine groups, but it does not provide any information about HA microgram quantities per strain in Flublok or standard-dose vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No dosage or formulation details are visible; information is limited to ELISA antibody responses.",
