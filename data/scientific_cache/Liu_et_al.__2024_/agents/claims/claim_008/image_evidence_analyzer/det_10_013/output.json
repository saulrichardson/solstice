  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-column table summarizing demographic characteristics (mean age, age groups, sex, race), study site distribution (BSWH vs KPNW), and influenza vaccination history of participants across four groups (n=122, 120, 283, 198). The table does not support the claim because it contains only participant demographics and vaccination history, with no data on HA content of Flublok or standard-dose vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The table is limited to demographics and prior vaccination history; it provides no information on hemagglutinin dose per strain.",
