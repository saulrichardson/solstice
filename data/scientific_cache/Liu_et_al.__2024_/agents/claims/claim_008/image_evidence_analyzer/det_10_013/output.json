  "explanation": "A table of demographic characteristics for four influenza vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4), showing number of participants, mean age, age group distribution, sex, race/ethnicity, study sites, and prior influenza vaccination history. The table presents only participant demographics and vaccination history; it does not include HA content per strain and therefore does not support the claim",
