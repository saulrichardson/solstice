  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multipanel figure showing microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination across four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4). The figure includes geometric mean titers with 95% confidence intervals, p-values for group comparisons, individual data points, and a legend identifying the vaccine formulations. The figure presents immunogenicity data and sample sizes but does not specify hemagglutinin microgram content per strain, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image only contains antibody titer results and study demographics; dosage information (HA \u00b5g per strain) is not shown.",
