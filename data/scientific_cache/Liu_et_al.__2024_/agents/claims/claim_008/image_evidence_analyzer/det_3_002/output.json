  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing microneutralization and hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for different influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). Four vaccine groups are compared by colored symbols and error bars. The figure presents immunogenicity titers but does not report antigen (HA) microgram content per strain for Flublok or standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim regarding 45 mcg vs 15 mcg of HA per strain.",
