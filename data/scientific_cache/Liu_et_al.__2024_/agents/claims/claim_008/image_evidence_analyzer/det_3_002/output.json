  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A 4x4 grid of dot\u2010and\u2010whisker plots showing microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (log2 scale) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age groups (18\u201344, 45\u201364) comparing four vaccine formulations (Fluzone IIV4, Fluad IIV4, cell\u2010culture IIV4, recombinant RIV4). P\u2010values for pairwise comparisons are displayed above certain timepoints. The figure presents immunogenicity titers over time for different vaccine formulations but does not report antigen (HA) content per strain. It doesn't support the claim about Flublok containing 45 mcg HA versus 15 mcg in standard\u2010dose vaccines, as no dosage information is shown. Note: The image is clear and legible; analysis is limited to visible data which focus solely on antibody titers, not antigen doses.",
