In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly compares recombinant (RIV4) and cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccines to egg-based (IIV4) vaccines, showing that RIV4 induces higher and broader antibody responses, which supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection."

      "quote": "After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg based vaccines generally reinforced the neutralizing antibody responses to egg adapted epitopes as evidenced by an increased trend in the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio \u22654. In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of participants with egg cell ratio \u22654 did not increase, suggesting a broader response not focused on egg-adapted epitopes.",

      "quote": "The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45. For ELISA, rHA antigens were coated at 100 ng/well. Serum samples were tested at an initial dilution of 1:400 followed by 2 fold serial dilution. Antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti human pan immunoglobulin conjugate to detect total binding antibodies. ELISA was performed based on previously described procedures 46 47. The ELISA titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum samples that achieved an optical density (OD) value of 0.2 or greater.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This methodological quote confirms that the immune response measured against recombinant HA proteins (from both egg and cell viruses) is broad, supporting the claim that recombinant technology can elicit antibodies to a wide range of viral antigens, not just those adapted to eggs."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that non-egg-based (including recombinant) vaccines do not increase the proportion of participants with a strong bias toward egg-adapted epitopes, implying a broader immune response that is not narrowly focused, which supports the claim of broader and potentially cross-protective immunity.",
