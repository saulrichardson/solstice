In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating ...",

      "quote": "After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg based vaccines generally reinforced the neutralizing antibody responses to egg adapted epitopes as evidenced by an increased trend in the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio \u22654. In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of participants with egg cell ratio \u22654 did not increase, suggesting a broader response.",
