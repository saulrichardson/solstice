  "explanation": "A multi-row table listing influenza vaccine virus strains (e.g., A/Michigan/45/2015, A/Idaho/07/2018, A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016, B/Colorado/06/2017, B/Phuket/3073/2013) with different propagation methods (cell, egg, egg-derived candidate vaccine virus) and showing amino acid substitutions at specific hemagglutinin positions. Footnotes describe which vaccine (RIV4, IIV4, ccIIV4) each virus was used in and define terms like loss of glycosylation motif. The table only details egg-adapted amino acid substitutions and vaccine virus propagation methods; it does not present data on immune responses or cross-protection and therefore does not support the claim Note: Image is clear and complete for the data shown, but no immunogenicity or efficacy results are presented",
