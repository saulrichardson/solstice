  "explanation": "A table listing amino acid differences at specific HA head domain positions for various influenza vaccine virus candidates (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) across cell-based and egg-based strains and across two seasons/years. The table only presents sequence differences between cell- and egg-derived vaccine virus candidates. It does not include any data on recombinant technology, immune response breadth, cross-protection, or mismatch season effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited by the absence of immunogenicity or clinical outcome data in the image; image quality sufficient for interpreting sequence information only.",
