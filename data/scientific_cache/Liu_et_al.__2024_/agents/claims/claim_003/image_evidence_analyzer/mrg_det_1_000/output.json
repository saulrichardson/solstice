  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram showing enrollment, allocation, follow-up, and re-randomization of participants over two influenza seasons (2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020) across four vaccine arms (cell-culture IIV4, recombinant-hemagglutinin influenza vaccine, and two egg-based IIV4 formulations), with counts for completed visits and exclusions. The figure provides only participant flow and randomization details; it contains no immunogenicity or cross-protection data and therefore does not support the claim.",
