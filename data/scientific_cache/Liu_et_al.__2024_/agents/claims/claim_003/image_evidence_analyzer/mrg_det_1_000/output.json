  "explanation": "CONSORT flow diagram showing screening and enrollment of participants in Year 1 and Year 2 of a vaccine study. Participants initially randomized to IIV4, ccIIV4, or RIV4 in Year 1 were re-randomized into different vaccine arms in Year 2, with numbers excluded per protocol and allocation counts for each group. The figure is only a participant flow diagram and provides no immunogenicity or cross-protection data, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is adequate for identifying content; however, no immunologic or efficacy outcomes are shown.",
