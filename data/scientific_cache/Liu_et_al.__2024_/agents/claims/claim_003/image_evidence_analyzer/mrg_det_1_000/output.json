  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram showing enrollment, randomization, vaccine allocation, follow\u2010up, and re\u2010randomization of participants over two influenza seasons (2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020) across four vaccine groups: cell-culture IIV4 (ccIIV4), recombinant-hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV4), Fluzone IIV4, and Fluarix IIV4. Participant numbers at each stage (day 0, 1 month, 6 months) and re-enrollment counts are detailed. The figure only depicts participant flow and vaccine assignment; it does not present immune response, cross-protection, or mismatch season data and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Figure is solely a CONSORT enrollment diagram; no immunogenicity or efficacy data are shown.",
