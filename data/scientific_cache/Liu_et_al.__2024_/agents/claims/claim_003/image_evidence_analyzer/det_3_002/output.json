  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log\u2082 scale) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). Data are plotted for four vaccine formulations: two egg-based (Fluzone IIV4, FluLaval IIV4), one cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and one recombinant (RIV4). P values indicating differences between formulations are annotated for some comparisons. The figure compares antibody titers to vaccine strains across formulations but provides no data on immune breadth against mismatched or drifted strains. Therefore, it does not support the claim that recombinant technology yields broader cross-protective responses in mismatch seasons. Note: Figure resolution limits detailed reading of all p values; however, no cross-strain or mismatch data are presented.",
