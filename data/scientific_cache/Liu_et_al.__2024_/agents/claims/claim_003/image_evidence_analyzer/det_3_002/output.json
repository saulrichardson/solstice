  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) titers (log2 scale) for A(H3N2) viruses and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers for A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses. Four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) are compared at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination via scatter plots with GMTs and 95% CIs. P values above horizontal bars indicate statistical differences between groups at each time point. Evidence: At 1-month and 6-month time points against cell-propagated A(H3N2) antigens, the RIV4 group (orange) shows higher GMTs with multiple significant p values (e.g., p<0.0001, p=0.0003) compared to egg-based vaccines, indicating stronger cross-reactive antibody responses. The figure shows that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) elicits significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against cell-propagated, mismatched A(H3N2) strains at both 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, which supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: Sample sizes vary by group and age, data are antibody titers not clinical efficacy; some panels (e.g., B strains) show minimal differences.",
