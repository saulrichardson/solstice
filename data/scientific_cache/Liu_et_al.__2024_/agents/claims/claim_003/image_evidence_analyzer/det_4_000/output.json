  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise in antibody titers 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and fold reduction at 6 months (panels C and D) against egg- and cell-propagated influenza antigens (H3N2, H1N1, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age groups (18\u201344, 45\u201364 years). Four vaccines are compared: egg-based Fluzone IIV4, egg-based Fluarix IIV4, cell culture-derived ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4. P-values denote significant differences between vaccines for each antigen. Evidence: RIV4 (recombinant) elicits significantly higher 1-month fold rises against cell-propagated H3N2 (p<0.0001) and other strains compared to egg-based vaccines, and shows greater persistence at 6 months against cell-derived antigens. The data show that the recombinant vaccine induces broader and stronger antibody responses to both egg- and cell-propagated antigens, particularly cell-propagated H3N2, which supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection in a mismatch season. Note: Evidence is limited to immunogenicity data (antibody titers) rather than clinical efficacy or direct cross-protection outcomes; interpretation assumes higher titers correlate with cross-protection.",
