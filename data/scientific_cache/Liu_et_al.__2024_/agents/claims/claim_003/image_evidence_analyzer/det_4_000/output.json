  "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold-rise of antibody titers 1 month post-vaccination (Panels A and B) and geometric mean fold-reduction of antibody titers 6 months post-vaccination (Panels C and D) for four vaccines (egg-based Fluzone IIV4, egg-based Fluarix IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4) in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Titers were measured against egg- and cell-propagated strains of A(H3N2), A(H1N1), B/Victoria and B/Yamagata viruses. P values denote comparisons among vaccines. The figure presents immunogenicity data (antibody fold-rise and persistence) against egg- and cell-propagated viral antigens but does not include any data on actual cross-protection or clinical effectiveness in a mismatch season; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to surrogate antibody measurements; no efficacy or mismatch-season challenge data are shown.",
