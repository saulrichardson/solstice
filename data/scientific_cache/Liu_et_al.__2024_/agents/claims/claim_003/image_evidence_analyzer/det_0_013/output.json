  "explanation": "Partial capture of a journal page showing publication metadata (received, accepted, published dates) alongside narrative text describing recombinant technology used in FluBlok Quadrivalent (RIV4), including baculovirus expression in insect cells, absence of egg-adaptive mutations, and potential immunological benefits. Evidence: Text stating that recombinant technology avoids egg-adaptive mutations and \u201cmay lead to a broader immune response\u201d and may provide \u201ccross-protection, even in a mismatch season.\u201d The narrative text explicitly attributes broader immune responses and potential cross-protection to recombinant technology, which supports the claim. Note: Image is a partial screenshot with some text cut off; context suggests narrative rather than raw data.",
