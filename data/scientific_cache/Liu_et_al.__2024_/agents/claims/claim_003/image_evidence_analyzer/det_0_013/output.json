  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Partial page from a medical journal (Nature Communications) showing introductory text and summary of an exploratory immunogenicity analysis comparing egg-based (IIV4), cell culture (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines, including references to subject numbers and A(H3N2) HA head binding antibodies. The visible text does not provide any data or statements indicating that recombinant technology produces a broader immune response or cross-protection in a mismatch season; it simply notes that immunogenicity was compared among different vaccine platforms and does not support the claim. Note: Excerpt is incomplete and may not include the full table or conclusions; image quality limits visibility of any potential detailed data.",
