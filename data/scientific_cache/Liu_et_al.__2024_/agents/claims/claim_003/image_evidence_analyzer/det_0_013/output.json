  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A partial page showing publication metadata (received, accepted, published online dates) on the left and a cut-off fragment of text/table on the right that is largely unreadable and does not present clear data. The visible portion of the image does not present any data comparing recombinant technology to broader immune responses or cross-protection in mismatch seasons, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The text is cut off and unreadable, limiting the ability to identify any relevant data; however, no clear supporting evidence is visible.",
