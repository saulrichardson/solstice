  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A multi\u2010panel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post\u2010vaccination in year 2, stratified by seven repeat vaccination arms (various sequences of egg\u2010based IIV4, cell\u2010based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) against egg\u2010 and cell\u2010propagated vaccine viruses for A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains. P values indicate differences in geometric mean titers between specific vaccine sequences. This figure presents antibody titers by vaccine sequence but does not directly compare recombinant versus non-recombinant vaccines for breadth of response or demonstrate cross-protection in a mismatch season; it does not support the claim. Note: The figure shows serologic responses only and lacks any data on clinical cross-protection or antigenic mismatch outcomes.",
