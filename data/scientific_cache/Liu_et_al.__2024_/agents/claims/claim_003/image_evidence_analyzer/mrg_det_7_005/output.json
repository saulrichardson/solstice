  "explanation": "Grid of box plots showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (Log2 scale) at Day 0 and one month post\u2013vaccination in two age cohorts (18\u201344 yrs and 45\u201364 yrs) for four influenza antigens (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Results are stratified by vaccine platform (egg-based, cell-based, recombinant) with pairwise statistical comparisons annotated. does not support the claim because the figure only presents HI titers against the homologous vaccine strains across different platforms and age groups, without data on divergent or mismatched circulating strains to demonstrate broader cross-protection elicited by the recombinant vaccine. Note: Limited by image resolution and absence of explicit evaluation of drifted or mismatched strains; however, the presented data focus solely on vaccine-matched antigens.",
