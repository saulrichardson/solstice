  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A two-panel figure (A: ages 18\u201344, B: ages 45\u201364) showing the proportion of subjects with \u22654-fold reduced haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against cell-grown vaccine virus compared with egg-grown virus for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Pre- and post-vaccination values are connected by lines for seven vaccine sequences (cell-based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4, egg-based IIV4, and various prime-boost combinations), with a legend indicating symbols for each regimen and p-values marking significant differences for A(H1N1)pdm09 (p=0.02) and B/Victoria (p=0.03). Evidence: Participants receiving recombinant vaccine (RIV4 prime and/or boost) showed lower proportions of \u22654-fold reduced HI titers post-vaccination against cell-grown strains compared to egg-based vaccine regimens, with statistically significant differences for A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria. The lower rate of HI titer reduction in recombinant vaccine recipients indicates broader cross-reactivity against mismatched, cell-grown viruses and thus supports the claim Note: Figure shows serologic surrogate endpoints only; no direct clinical protection data and reading exact values is limited by figure resolution",
