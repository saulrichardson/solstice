  "explanation": "Two-panel figure showing proportions of participants with \u22654-fold reduced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers to cell-propagated vaccine virus (egg/cell titer ratio \u22654) pre- and post-vaccination for each of four influenza vaccine components (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) across seven repeat vaccination arms and two age groups (18\u201344 years; 45\u201364 years). Data points with trend lines and p-values compare pre- and post-vaccination proportions. The figure evaluates egg- vs. cell-based HI titer ratios and demonstrates changes in egg-adaptive antibody responses across different vaccination arms, but it does not provide data on broader immune response breadth or cross-protection in mismatch seasons, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Interpretation limited to egg/cell HI titer ratios; no direct data on cross-protection or mismatch season efficacy visible.",
