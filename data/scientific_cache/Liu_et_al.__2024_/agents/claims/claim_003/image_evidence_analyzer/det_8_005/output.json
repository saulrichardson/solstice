  "explanation": "Two panels (A: 18\u201344 years; B: 45\u201364 years) showing, for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata), the proportion of participants achieving a \u22654-fold change in hemagglutination inhibition titer from pre- to post-vaccination. Data are plotted for seven vaccination regimens combining cell-culture quadrivalent (ccIIV4), recombinant quadrivalent (RIV4), and egg-based quadrivalent (IIV4) vaccines, with select p-values indicated. The figure presents immunogenicity comparisons between cell-culture, recombinant, and egg-based vaccine regimens across age groups for matched vaccine strains, but it does not include data on mismatched seasons or demonstrate broader cross-protective responses against non-vaccine or drifted strains; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Interpretation limited by absence of explicit mismatch or cross-challenge data and reliance on summary proportion plots; vaccine regimen symbols require referencing legend for exact group identities.",
