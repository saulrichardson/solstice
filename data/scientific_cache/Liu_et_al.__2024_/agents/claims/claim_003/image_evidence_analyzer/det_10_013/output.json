  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A table showing the demographic characteristics and influenza vaccination history of study participants across four groups (n=122, 120, 283, 198), including age, sex, race/ethnicity, study site, and prior vaccination seasons. The table provides only participant demographics and vaccination history; it does not present any immunogenicity data or comparisons of recombinant vaccine responses in mismatch seasons, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible; however, it contains no data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or recombinant technology outcomes.",
