  "explanation": "A table of demographic characteristics and prior influenza vaccination history for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4), showing sample sizes, mean age, age groups, sex, race/ethnicity, study site, and vaccination history percentages. The table only presents baseline demographic and vaccination history data; it does not include any immunogenicity, cross\u2010protection, or mismatch season response results, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited to demographic information; no immune response or clinical outcome data are shown.",
