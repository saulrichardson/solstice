  "explanation": "Four\u2010panel figure (A\u2013D) comparing immune responses to four quadrivalent influenza vaccines (egg-based Fluzone IIV4, egg-based Fluarix IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) in two adult age cohorts (18\u201344\u2009y in A/C and 45\u201364\u2009y in B/D). Panels A and B plot the geometric mean ratio of hemagglutination\u2010inhibition titers against egg-grown versus cell-grown A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains with 95% CIs and p-values. Panels C and D show the proportion of subjects experiencing \u22654-fold reduction in titer when switching from egg- to cell-grown A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata pre- and post-vaccination, with p-values for A(H3N2). Evidence: In panels A and B, RIV4 (recombinant) shows significantly lower geometric mean egg-to-cell virus titer ratios for A(H3N2) (2.0 in 18\u201344\u2009y, 1.8 in 45\u201364\u2009y) compared to egg-based vaccines (3.7\u20134.0) and cell-based ccIIV4 (3.1\u20132.6). In panels C and D, RIV4 recipients exhibit a significant decrease in the proportion with \u22654-fold reduced titer against cell-grown A(H3N2) post-vaccination (from 58% to 26% in 18\u201344\u2009y, p=0.0001; from 40% to 21% in 45\u201364\u2009y, p=0.005). The figure shows that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) elicits a narrower difference between egg- and cell-adapted virus titers and substantially fewer large titer drops against cell-grown A(H3N2), indicating broader cross-reactive immunity even when egg-based strains are mismatched, and thus supports the claim. Note: Analysis is based on surrogate immunogenicity endpoints in adults aged 18\u201364; image text is legible but full study design and clinical efficacy data are not shown.",
