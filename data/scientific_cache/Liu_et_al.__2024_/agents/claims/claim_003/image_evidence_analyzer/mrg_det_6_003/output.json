  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Four\u2010panel figure comparing immune responses in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) across four vaccine types: Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell\u2010culture IIV4 (ccIIV4), and recombinant HA quadrivalent (RIV4). Panels A and B show the geometric mean ratios of egg\u2010grown to cell\u2010grown virus titers (with 95% CIs) for each vaccine against A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains. Panels C and D show the proportion of subjects with \u22654\u2010fold reductions in titer to cell\u2010grown vaccine virus pre\u2010 versus post\u2010vaccination, with p\u2010values and percentage changes noted, particularly for A(H3N2). Evidence: In panels A and B, RIV4 exhibits significantly lower egg\u2010to\u2010cell titer ratios versus the egg\u2010based vaccines (p=0.03 to <0.0001), indicating broader reactivity to cell\u2010grown virus. In panels C and D, RIV4 shows the greatest reduction in the proportion of \u22654\u2010fold titer loss to cell\u2010grown A(H3N2) (from 58% to 26%, p=0.0001, and from 40% to 21%, p=0.005), suggesting enhanced cross\u2010protection in a mismatch season. supports the claim because recombinant RIV4 induces antibody responses with lower divergence between egg\u2010 and cell\u2010grown antigens and demonstrates greater preservation of neutralization against cell\u2010grown (circulating) strains, implying a broader, cross\u2010protective immune response even when vaccine and circulating strains mismatch. Note: While the presented data support broader cross\u2010reactivity for RIV4 in these age groups, the analysis is limited to serologic endpoints rather than clinical effectiveness, and only two age cohorts and specific strains are shown.",
