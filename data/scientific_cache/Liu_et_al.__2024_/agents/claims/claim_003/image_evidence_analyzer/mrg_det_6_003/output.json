  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing geometric mean ratios of egg/cell virus titers at 1-month post-vaccination with 95% CI (panels A and B) and proportions of participants with \u22654-fold reduced titer to cell-grown vaccine virus pre- and post-vaccination (panels C and D) for age groups 18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years, comparing four vaccine formulations: egg-based Fluzone IIV4, egg-based Fluarix IIV4, cell-culture ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4. The figure presents immunogenicity measures (egg vs cell virus titers and proportions of titer reductions) for RIV4 but does not show data on broader antigenic breadth or actual cross-protection in a mismatch season, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited to surrogate immunologic endpoints; no direct assessment of cross-protective efficacy or mismatch season performance.",
