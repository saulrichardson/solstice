  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "The figure presents ELISA-measured geometric mean titers (GMTs) of hemagglutinin (HA) head and stalk binding antibodies at Day 0 and 1 month post\u2010vaccination across seven repeat vaccination arms: cell culture quadrivalent (ccIIV4), recombinant quadrivalent (RIV4), and egg-based quadrivalent (IIV4) used in various prime/boost combinations. Panels show head titers for H3N2, pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata antigens, ratios of egg\u2010 versus cell\u2010based head titers, stalk titers for H3 and H1, and fold\u2010rise of stalk antibody titers with 95% confidence intervals and reported p values for within\u2010group comparisons. Evidence: Statistically significant increases in H3 stalk antibody titers at 1 month post\u2010vaccination in recombinant\u2010containing arms (ccIIV4-RIV4 p=0.0001; RIV4-RIV4 p=0.004; IIV4-RIV4 p=0.03), and in H1 stalk antibodies in at least one recombinant arm (RIV4-ccIIV4 p=0.006). The data show that vaccination regimens including recombinant vaccine (RIV4) induce significantly higher HA stalk antibody responses, which are broadly cross-reactive, supporting the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. Note: The figure reports antibody titers and fold-rises but does not include direct clinical efficacy data in a mismatch season. Sample sizes per arm are modest, and cross-protection is inferred from stalk antibody levels rather than demonstrated by challenge or epidemiological outcomes.",
