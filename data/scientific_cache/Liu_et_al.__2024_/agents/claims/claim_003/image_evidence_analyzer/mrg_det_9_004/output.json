  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (Log2 scale) against egg- and cell-derived HA (panel A), geometric mean ELISA titer ratios (egg/cell HA, panel B), and stalk-specific ELISA titers for H3 and H1 (panel C) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination, as well as fold-rise in HA stalk ELISA titers (panel D) for multiple vaccine regimens (including cell-based and recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccines). Evidence: Panel C shows somewhat higher H3 and H1 stalk ELISA titers at 1 month in recombinant vaccine groups (e.g. p\u2009=\u20090.037 for H3 stalk; p\u2009=\u20090.017 for H1 stalk), indicating an immune response to conserved stalk regions. The figure demonstrates that recombinant vaccine recipients have increased stalk-specific antibody titers, suggesting a broader immune response, but it does not include data on actual cross-protection or performance in a mismatch season, and therefore does not support the claim about cross-protection in a mismatch season. Note: The sample sizes and exact group definitions are not fully clear from the image; no direct challenge or mismatch strain data are presented.",
