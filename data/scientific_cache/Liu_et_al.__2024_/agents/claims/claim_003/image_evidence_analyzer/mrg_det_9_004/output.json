  "claim_id": "claim_003",
  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Multipanel figure displaying ELISA antibody titers against hemagglutinin (HA) from egg- and cell-grown viruses (Panel A), geometric mean ratios of egg/cell HA ELISA titers (Panel B), ELISA titers against the conserved H3 and H1 stalk domains at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination (Panel C), and fold-rise in stalk titers from Day 0 to 1 month (Panel D). Data are shown for seven vaccine prime-boost groups involving cell-culture\u2013derived inactivated quadrivalent (ccIIV4), recombinant HA quadrivalent (RIV4), and egg-based inactivated quadrivalent (IIV4) formulations. Evidence: Panels C and D demonstrate that vaccine regimens including the recombinant RIV4 component elicited significantly higher H3 and H1 stalk antibody titers (p\u22640.037) and greater geometric mean fold\u2010rises in stalk responses compared to conventional formulations. The elevated stalk\u2010specific antibody responses in RIV4\u2010containing groups indicate a broader immune response targeting conserved HA regions, which supports the claim Note: The figure shows immunologic surrogate markers (stalk antibody titers) rather than direct clinical cross-protection in a mismatch season; small text and some p-values are difficult to read clearly",
