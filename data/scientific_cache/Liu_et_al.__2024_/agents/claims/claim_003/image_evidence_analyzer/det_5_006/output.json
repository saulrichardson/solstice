  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA-measured antibody titers to HA head (egg and cell virus HA) for influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination (Panel A), the geometric mean ratios of egg to cell HA titers (Panel B), HA stalk-binding antibody titers for H3 and H1 stalk domains at the same time points (Panel C), and fold-rise of stalk titers from Day 0 to 1 month (Panel D). Four vaccine groups are color-coded: Fluzone IIV4 (gray), Fluarix IIV4 (blue), ccIIV4 (green), and recombinant HA vaccine RIV4 (orange). Statistical significance bars and p-values are shown. Evidence: Recombinant vaccine (RIV4) elicited significantly higher HA stalk antibody titers and greater fold-rise at 1 month post-vaccination compared to other groups, indicating a broader, cross-reactive immune response. supports the claim because the figure demonstrates that the recombinant HA vaccine induces stronger stalk-directed antibody responses\u2014a correlate of broad cross-protection\u2014even though mismatch-season efficacy is not directly measured, this broader immunity suggests potential cross-protection. Note: While stalk antibody responses suggest broader immunity, the figure does not directly assess clinical cross-protection in a mismatch season; efficacy data are not presented.",
