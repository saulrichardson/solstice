  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers and ratios for four influenza vaccines (two egg-based: Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4; one cell culture-based: ccIIV4; one recombinant HA-based: RIV4). Panel A: Log\u2082 ELISA titers to egg-grown and cell-grown HA of A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months. Panel B: Geometric mean ratio of egg vs cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month across H3 HA, H1 HA, B/Victoria HA, and B/Yamagata HA. Panel C: Log\u2082 ELISA titers against H3 stalk and H1 stalk at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months. Panel D: Geometric mean fold-rise in HA stalk ELISA titers (1 month/day 0) for H3 stalk and H1 stalk. Evidence: RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) elicited higher stalk-specific antibody titers and greater fold-rise at 1 month compared with egg-based vaccines. The figure shows that the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4) induces a broader immune response against conserved HA stalk domains, but it does not include any direct data on cross-protection during a mismatch season; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: No direct challenge or efficacy data in a mismatch season; only immunogenicity measures are shown.",
