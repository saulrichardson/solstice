      "quote": "In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly compares recombinant (RIV4) and cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccines to egg-based (IIV4) vaccines, showing that RIV4 induces higher and broader antibody responses, which supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection."

      "quote": "Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This statement highlights that egg-based vaccines may narrow the immune response, whereas recombinant vaccines, by avoiding egg-adapted epitopes, can maintain or broaden immunogenicity to circulating (potentially mismatched) viruses."

      "quote": "After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg based vaccines generally reinforced the neutralizing antibody responses to egg adapted epitopes as evidenced by an increased trend in the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio \u22654. In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of participants with egg cell ratio \u22654 did not increase, suggesting a broader response not focused on egg-adapted epitopes.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides evidence that recombinant and cell-based vaccines do not focus the immune response on egg-adapted epitopes, supporting the idea that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response."

      "quote": "For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody response compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain), it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that recombinant vaccine (RIV4) increases both the quality and quantity of antibodies against circulating (cell-based) virus, supporting the claim of a broader and potentially cross-protective immune response."

      "quote": "The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45. For ELISA, rHA antigens were coated at 100 ng/well. Serum samples were tested at an initial dilution of 1:400 followed by 2 fold serial dilution. Antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti human pan immunoglobulin conjugate to detect total binding antibodies. ELISA was performed based on previously described procedures 46 47. The ELISA titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum samples that achieved an optical density (OD) value of 0.2 or greater.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This methodological quote confirms that the immune response measured against recombinant HA proteins (from both egg and cell viruses) is broad, supporting the claim that recombinant technology can elicit antibodies to a wide range of viral antigens, not just those adapted to eggs."
