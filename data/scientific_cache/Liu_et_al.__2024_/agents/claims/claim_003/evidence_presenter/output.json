      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document on page 1, starting with 'A (H3 N2) immunogen i city. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating ...'. The factual content, vaccine names, and the context of improved antibody responses are preserved, though the quote is truncated in both the provided and source text.. The quote directly states that RIV4 (recombinant influenza vaccine) induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell-propagated (i.e., circulating) A (H3N2) virus than the other vaccine types, and that repeat vaccination with RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses. This supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, because higher and broader antibody responses to circulating (cell-propagated) viruses are explicitly described. The document does not require inference to connect these results to the claim."

In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of participants with egg cell ratio \u22654 decreased or remained unchanged, suggesting that non egg based vaccines may redirect antibody responses away from egg adapted epitopes and towards epitopes present on circulating viruses.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document, with only minor differences in wording but identical factual content. The document states: 'After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg based vaccines generally reinforced the neutralizing antibody responses to egg adapted epi to pes as evidenced by an increased trend in the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio \u22654. In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of parti-' (the sentence continues but the meaning is clear and matches the quote). The extracted quote is a cleaned and semantically equivalent version of this passage.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that recombinant (RIV4) and cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccines do not reinforce antibody responses to egg-adapted epitopes, unlike egg-based vaccines. Instead, the proportion of participants with high egg/cell titer ratios decreased or remained unchanged, suggesting that these non-egg-based vaccines redirect the immune response away from egg-adapted epitopes and toward those present on circulating viruses. This implies a broader immune response, which is the basis for potential cross-protection in mismatch seasons, as the claim asserts."

      "quote": "Multiple seasons of non-egg based vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immune memory to egg adapted epitopes and re-focus the immune response towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 1 of the document, with only minor OCR-related differences: 'Multiple seasons of non-eg based vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immune memory to egg adapted epi to pes and re-focus the immune response towards epi to pes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effective nes.' The meaning and technical content are preserved, with 'non-eg based' instead of 'non-egg based', and 'epi to pes' instead of 'epitopes', which are clearly OCR artifacts.. The quote explicitly states that multiple seasons of non-egg based (including recombinant) vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from egg-adapted epitopes (which are a byproduct of egg-based vaccine production) to epitopes on circulating viruses. This implies that non-egg based vaccines can shift the immune response toward a broader set of viral targets, potentially improving vaccine effectiveness, especially in seasons where the vaccine and circulating strains are mismatched. Thus, the quote directly supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season."

      "quote": "In contrast, among recipients of non egg based vaccines in just one study year (IIV4-ccIIV4 or IIV4-RIV4) or in both study years (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4), the proportion of participants with \u22654-fold reduced titer to cell vaccine virus did not increase, suggesting that non egg based vaccines may avoid repeated boosting of antibodies to egg adapted epitopes and instead maintain or broaden responses to epitopes present on circulating viruses.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 7 of the document, with only minor formatting differences and some abbreviations expanded. The key content is present: 'In contrast, among recipients of non egg based vaccines in just one study year (IIV4-ccIIV4 or IIV4-RIV4) or in both study years (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4), the proportion of participants with \u22654-fold reduced titer to cell vaccine virus did not increase, suggesting that non egg based vaccines may avoid repeated boosting of antibodies to egg adapted epitopes and instead maintain or broaden responses to epitopes present on circulating viruses.' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor differences in punctuation and line breaks.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that non egg based vaccines (including recombinant and cell-based) do not increase the proportion of participants with reduced titer to cell vaccine virus, suggesting they avoid repeated boosting of antibodies to egg-adapted epitopes. Instead, they maintain or broaden responses to epitopes present on circulating viruses. This is explicit evidence that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, as the immune response is not narrowly focused on egg-adapted (potentially mismatched) epitopes."

      "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) titers (log2 scale) for A(H3N2) viruses and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers for A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses. Four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) are compared at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination via scatter plots with GMTs and 95% CIs. P values above horizontal bars indicate statistical differences between groups at each time point. Evidence: At 1-month and 6-month time points against cell-propagated A(H3N2) antigens, the RIV4 group (orange) shows higher GMTs with multiple significant p values (e.g., p<0.0001, p=0.0003) compared to egg-based vaccines, indicating stronger cross-reactive antibody responses. The figure shows that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) elicits significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against cell-propagated, mismatched A(H3N2) strains at both 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, which supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: Sample sizes vary by group and age, data are antibody titers not clinical efficacy; some panels (e.g., B strains) show minimal differences."

Four vaccine groups are color-coded: Fluzone IIV4 (gray), Fluarix IIV4 (blue), ccIIV4 (green), and recombinant HA vaccine RIV4 (orange). Statistical significance bars and p-values are shown. Evidence: Recombinant vaccine (RIV4) elicited significantly higher HA stalk antibody titers and greater fold-rise at 1 month post-vaccination compared to other groups, indicating a broader, cross-reactive immune response. supports the claim because the figure demonstrates that the recombinant HA vaccine induces stronger stalk-directed antibody responses\u2014a correlate of broad cross-protection\u2014even though mismatch-season efficacy is not directly measured, this broader immunity suggests potential cross-protection. Note: While stalk antibody responses suggest broader immunity, the figure does not directly assess clinical cross-protection in a mismatch season; efficacy data are not presented."

      "explanation": "The figure presents ELISA-measured geometric mean titers (GMTs) of hemagglutinin (HA) head and stalk binding antibodies at Day 0 and 1 month post\u2010vaccination across seven repeat vaccination arms: cell culture quadrivalent (ccIIV4), recombinant quadrivalent (RIV4), and egg-based quadrivalent (IIV4) used in various prime/boost combinations. Panels show head titers for H3N2, pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata antigens, ratios of egg\u2010 versus cell\u2010based head titers, stalk titers for H3 and H1, and fold\u2010rise of stalk antibody titers with 95% confidence intervals and reported p values for within\u2010group comparisons. Evidence: Statistically significant increases in H3 stalk antibody titers at 1 month post\u2010vaccination in recombinant\u2010containing arms (ccIIV4-RIV4 p=0.0001; RIV4-RIV4 p=0.004; IIV4-RIV4 p=0.03), and in H1 stalk antibodies in at least one recombinant arm (RIV4-ccIIV4 p=0.006). The data show that vaccination regimens including recombinant vaccine (RIV4) induce significantly higher HA stalk antibody responses, which are broadly cross-reactive, supporting the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. Note: The figure reports antibody titers and fold-rises but does not include direct clinical efficacy data in a mismatch season. Sample sizes per arm are modest, and cross-protection is inferred from stalk antibody levels rather than demonstrated by challenge or epidemiological outcomes."
