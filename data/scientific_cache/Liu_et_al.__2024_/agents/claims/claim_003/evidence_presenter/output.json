      "quote": "In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating ...",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that RIV4 (recombinant vaccine) induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell-propagated (i.e., circulating-like) A (H3N2) virus than the other vaccines, and that repeat vaccination with RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses. This demonstrates that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response, which is the basis for potential cross-protection, especially in seasons where the vaccine and circulating strains may not be perfectly matched. The quote provides explicit evidence for the claim, without requiring inference beyond what is stated."

      "quote": "After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg based vaccines generally reinforced the neutralizing antibody responses to egg adapted epitopes as evidenced by an increased trend in the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio \u22654. In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of participants with egg cell ratio \u22654 did not increase, suggesting a broader response.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly compares the immune response profiles of egg-based versus recombinant (RIV4) and cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccines. It states that egg-based vaccines reinforce a response to egg-adapted epitopes (narrower), while RIV4 and ccIIV4 do not, suggesting a broader immune response. This broader response is the basis for the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. The quote provides explicit evidence for the claim."

      "quote": "In contrast, among recipients of non egg based vaccines in just one study year (IIV4-ccIIV4 or IIV4-RIV4) or in both study years (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-IIV4, RIV4-RIV4), the proportion of participants with GMT egg cell titer ratio \u22654 did not increase, suggesting a broader response.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It states that recipients of non-egg-based vaccines (which includes recombinant vaccines) did not show an increase in the proportion of participants with a high GMT egg cell titer ratio, which is interpreted as evidence of a broader immune response. The phrase 'suggesting a broader response' explicitly links the observation to broader immunity, which is the core of the claim. The context in the document is about the immune response breadth after vaccination with recombinant and cell-based vaccines, supporting the idea that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season."

      "explanation": "Multi-panel plots of microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (log2 scale) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination. Data are shown for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluad IIV4, cell culture-derived IIV4, recombinant RIV4) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years), with titers measured against both egg-propagated and cell-propagated influenza antigens (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Statistical comparisons (p-values) are annotated for select group differences. Evidence: Recombinant RIV4 induced equal or higher MN titers against the cell-propagated A(H3N2) strain\u2014often with statistically significant superiority (e.g., p<0.0001 at 1 month and p=0.0038 at 6 months in the 18\u201344 yr cohort)\u2014compared with the egg-based and cell-based IIV4 vaccines. The figure demonstrates that recombinant technology (RIV4) generates robust neutralizing antibody responses not only to the vaccine (egg-propagated) strain but also to a cell-propagated variant, indicating a broader immune response with cross-reactivity; this supports the claim that recombinant vaccines may provide cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: Exact group comparisons and p-value pairings are small and partially ambiguous; the data are immunogenicity endpoints, not direct clinical efficacy, and mismatch is modeled only by egg vs cell propagation rather than distinct drifted strains."

      "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise in antibody titers 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and geometric mean fold reduction in antibody titers 6 months post-vaccination (panels C and D) for four vaccine formulations (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-culture IIV4 [ccIIV4], and recombinant HA vaccine [RIV4]) against egg-grown and cell-grown antigens of H3N2, H1N1, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Each data point is the geometric mean with 95% confidence intervals and annotated p-values for pairwise comparisons. Evidence: RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) elicited significantly higher 1-month fold rises in antibody titers against both egg-grown and cell-grown H3N2 and H1N1 strains compared with egg-based and ccIIV4 vaccines (e.g., H3N2 cell: ~3.2-fold vs ~1.7\u20131.8 with p<0.0001) and demonstrated less waning at 6 months against mismatched cell-grown antigens (e.g., H1N1 cell: ~2.5-fold reduction vs ~1.5\u20131.8 with p<0.0001). The figure supports the claim because it shows that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) induces a broader antibody response, with higher titers to both egg- and cell-derived (potentially mismatch) strains and slower waning over 6 months compared with egg-based and cell-culture vaccines, thus supporting cross-protection in mismatch settings. Note: Immunogenicity data are surrogate markers and do not directly measure clinical protection; the figure does not show actual efficacy in a mismatched season, only antibody responses."

      "explanation": "Multi-panel ELISA titer data comparing four quadrivalent influenza vaccines (egg-based Fluzone IIV4, egg-based Fluarix IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4). Panel A shows HA binding titers (Log2 scale) against egg-adapted and cell-produced HA antigens for A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination. Panel B shows geometric mean ratios of egg-to-cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month. Panel C shows stalk-specific ELISA titers (Log2) for H3 and H1 stalk antigens at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months. Panel D shows geometric mean fold-rise in stalk titers at 1 month relative to Day 0. Statistical comparisons (p values) between groups are annotated. Evidence: In Panels C and D, the recombinant RIV4 vaccine (orange) elicits significantly higher H3 and H1 stalk ELISA titers and greater fold-rise in stalk antibodies compared to egg-based vaccines (p<0.0001 in multiple comparisons). The image shows that the recombinant vaccine induces higher stalk antibody titers, demonstrating a broader immune response targeting conserved HA regions that could mediate cross-protection; this supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season. Note: The data are immunogenicity endpoints (ELISA titers) rather than clinical effectiveness in a mismatch season. No direct virologic or clinical protection data are shown, only surrogate antibody measures."

      "explanation": "Four\u2010panel figure (A\u2013D) comparing immune responses to four quadrivalent influenza vaccines (egg-based Fluzone IIV4, egg-based Fluarix IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) in two adult age cohorts (18\u201344\u2009y in A/C and 45\u201364\u2009y in B/D). Panels A and B plot the geometric mean ratio of hemagglutination\u2010inhibition titers against egg-grown versus cell-grown A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains with 95% CIs and p-values. Panels C and D show the proportion of subjects experiencing \u22654-fold reduction in titer when switching from egg- to cell-grown A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata pre- and post-vaccination, with p-values for A(H3N2). Evidence: In panels A and B, RIV4 (recombinant) shows significantly lower geometric mean egg-to-cell virus titer ratios for A(H3N2) (2.0 in 18\u201344\u2009y, 1.8 in 45\u201364\u2009y) compared to egg-based vaccines (3.7\u20134.0) and cell-based ccIIV4 (3.1\u20132.6). In panels C and D, RIV4 recipients exhibit a significant decrease in the proportion with \u22654-fold reduced titer against cell-grown A(H3N2) post-vaccination (from 58% to 26% in 18\u201344\u2009y, p=0.0001; from 40% to 21% in 45\u201364\u2009y, p=0.005). The figure shows that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) elicits a narrower difference between egg- and cell-adapted virus titers and substantially fewer large titer drops against cell-grown A(H3N2), indicating broader cross-reactive immunity even when egg-based strains are mismatched, and thus supports the claim. Note: Analysis is based on surrogate immunogenicity endpoints in adults aged 18\u201364; image text is legible but full study design and clinical efficacy data are not shown."
