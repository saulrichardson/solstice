It states that recombinant (RIV4) and cell-based (ccIIV4) vaccines do not increase the proportion of participants with a high GMT egg cell titer ratio, unlike egg-based vaccines, which do. This is interpreted as evidence that RIV4 and ccIIV4 elicit a broader immune response not focused on egg-adapted epitopes.
