      "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA-measured antibody responses to influenza HA. Panel A: total HA binding titers (log2) for egg-derived and cell-derived HA antigens (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluad IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4). Panel B: geometric mean ratio of egg/cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month. Panel C: H3 stalk and H1 stalk antibody titers (log2) at Day 0, 1 month, 6 months post-vaccination, with pairwise p-values. Panel D: geometric mean fold-rise (1 month/Day 0) of H3 and H1 stalk titers with 95% CI. Evidence: In Panel C, at 1 month post-vaccination RIV4 (recombinant HA) elicits significantly higher H3 stalk and H1 stalk ELISA titers than egg-based Fluzone IIV4 (p<0.0001). supports the claim because the RIV4 group, produced via BEVS, shows significantly greater induction of stalk-directed (highly conserved region) antibodies compared with the egg-derived vaccine group. Note: Some p-value text is small; group labels are inferred from color legend but overall differences are clear.",
