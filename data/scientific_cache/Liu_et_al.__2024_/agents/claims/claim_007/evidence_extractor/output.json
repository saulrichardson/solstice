      "quote": "The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45. For ELISA, rHA antigens were coated at 100 ng/well. Serum samples were tested at an initial dilution of 1:400 followed by 2 fold serial dilution. Antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti human pan immunoglobulin conjugate to detect total binding antibodies. ELISA was performed based on previously described procedures 46 47. The ELISA titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum samples that achieved an optical density (OD) value of 0.2 or greater.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that the recombinant HA antigens used in the study were produced using the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), which is necessary context for interpreting the immunogenicity results that follow."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly supports the claim by stating that the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4, produced using BEVS) induced significantly higher levels of antibodies against the HA of circulating (cell-derived) A (H3N2) viruses compared to other vaccine types."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4) produced the highest levels of antibodies against the conserved HA stalk region, which is a key aspect of broadly cross-reactive immunity."
