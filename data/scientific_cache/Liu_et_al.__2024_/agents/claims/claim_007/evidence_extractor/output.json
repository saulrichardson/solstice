      "quote": "The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45. For ELISA, rHA antigens were coated at 100 ng/well. Serum samples were tested at an initial dilution of 1:400 followed by 2 fold serial dilution. Antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti human pan immunoglobulin conjugate to detect total binding antibodies. ELISA was performed based on previously described procedures 46 47. The ELISA titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum samples that achieved an optical density (OD) value of 0.2 or greater. ... These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from both egg and cell propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens), and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk, and A (H3 N2) HA stalk).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote establishes that the study directly measured antibody responses to recombinant HA antigens produced using the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), including those targeting highly conserved HA stalk regions, which is necessary to support the claim."

      "quote": "Comparing HA stalk antibody titers at 1 month post vaccination versus day 0, vaccination significantly boosted A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk antibodies in all 4 vaccine groups (p < 0.01), and significantly boosted A (H3 N2) HA stalk antibodies in 3 of the 4 vaccine groups (p < 0.001, Flu zone IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) (Fig. 4 C). The RIV4 group had the highest A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk and A (H3 N2) HA stalk antibodies at 1 month post vaccination, however the fold rises of HA stalk antibodies were low (<1.8) and similar among all 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 4 D).",
