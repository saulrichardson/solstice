      "quote": "The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45. For ELISA, rHA antigens were coated at 100 ng/well. Serum samples were tested at an initial dilution of 1:400 followed by 2 fold serial dilution. Antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti human pan immunoglobulin conjugate to detect total binding antibodies. ELISA was performed based on previously described procedures 46 47. The ELISA titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum samples that achieved an optical density (OD) value of 0.2 or greater.",

The RIV4 group had the highest A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk and A (H3 N2) HA stalk antibodies at 1 month post vaccination, however the fold rises of HA stalk antibodies were low (<1.8) and similar among all 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 4 D).",
