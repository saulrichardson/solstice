      "explanation": "Multi\u2010panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) against whole HA from egg-derived and cell-derived virus (panel A), geometric mean ratios of egg vs cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month (panel B), ELISA titers against H3 and H1 stalk domains over time (panel C), and fold-rise of stalk ELISA titers 1 month vs baseline (panel D) for four licensed vaccines (two egg-based IIV4s in black/blue, one cell-based IIV4 in green, and one recombinant HA vaccine in orange). Evidence: In panels C and D, the recombinant HA vaccine (orange) elicits significantly higher H3 and H1 stalk ELISA titers and fold-rise at 1 month compared with egg-derived vaccines (p values <0.05). The figure shows that the BEVS-produced recombinant HA vaccine induces higher levels of antibodies against the conserved HA stalk region than egg-derived vaccines (p<0.05), which supports the claim. Note: Resolution of some p-value labels is low, but the significant differences in stalk responses for the recombinant vaccine are clear."
