  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure (Panels A\u2013D) showing immune response comparisons among four influenza vaccines (two egg-derived IIV4s: Fluzone and Fluarix; a cell culture\u2013derived IIV4; and a recombinant HA vaccine [RIV4]) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). Panels A and B plot geometric mean ratios of antibody titers against egg-grown versus cell-grown vaccine viruses for four influenza strains (A[H3N2], A[H1N1]pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Panels C and D show the proportion or magnitude of \u22654-fold reduced titers to cell-grown vaccine virus (egg vs. cell) pre- and post-vaccination. The figure compares titers to egg-grown versus cell-grown vaccine virus strains and shows that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) elicits lower egg-versus-cell titer ratios for A(H3N2), indicating less egg-adaptation bias. However, it does not present data on antibodies targeting highly conserved HA regions or demonstrate broadly cross-reactive antibody levels; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Resolution limits precise reading of annotations; no direct assay of conserved-region reactivity visible.",
