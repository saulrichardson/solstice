  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure comparing immune responses to egg-adapted versus cell-grown vaccine viruses for four vaccine formulations (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) in two age groups (18\u201344 years: panels A and C; 45\u201364 years: panels B and D). Panels A and B show geometric mean ratios (egg/cell virus titer) at 1 month post-vaccination with 95% CIs for each vaccine component (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM). Panels C and D show pre- and post-vaccination proportions of subjects with \u22654-fold reduced titer to cell-grown virus. does not support the claim \u2013 the figure only presents comparisons of antibody titers against egg- versus cell-grown vaccine viruses and does not measure or demonstrate broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved HA regions. Note: No measurements of conserved-region cross-reactivity are provided; data focus solely on egg-adapted versus cell virus titer responses.",
