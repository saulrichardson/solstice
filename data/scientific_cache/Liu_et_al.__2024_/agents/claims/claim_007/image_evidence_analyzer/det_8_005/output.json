  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two-panel figure showing, for age groups 18\u201344 years (A) and 45\u201364 years (B), the proportion of subjects with \u22654-fold reduced hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) titers against cell-grown vaccine virus relative to egg-grown virus, measured pre- and post-vaccination for influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. Different symbols represent seven vaccine sequence groups (egg-derived IIV4, cell-culture ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4, and Fluzone IIV4 in various prime-boost combinations). The figure reports strain-specific HI titer reductions for various vaccine combinations and does not measure broadly cross-reactive antibodies against conserved HA regions or directly compare recombinant BEVS vaccines with egg-derived vaccines on that endpoint, so it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to what is visible: small text but legible; no data on cross-reactive or stalk-specific antibody responses.",
