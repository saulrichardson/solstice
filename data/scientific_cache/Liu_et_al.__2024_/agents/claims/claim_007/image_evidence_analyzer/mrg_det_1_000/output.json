  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "CONSORT flow diagram for screening and enrollment of participants in Year 2 (2019\u20132020), showing re\u2010enrollment of Year 1 participants and new enrollees randomized to inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4), cell\u2010culture based IIV4 (ccIIV4), or recombinant\u2010hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV4) arms, with numbers of participants included, excluded, and allocated to each vaccine sequence. The image presents only participant flow and randomization numbers; it contains no data on antibody levels, cross\u2010reactivity, or comparisons between BEVS\u2010produced recombinant HA and egg\u2010derived vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible CONSORT diagram; no immunogenicity or antibody data are shown.",
