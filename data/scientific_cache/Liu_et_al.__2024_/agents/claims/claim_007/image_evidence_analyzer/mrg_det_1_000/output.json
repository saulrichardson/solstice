  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "CONSORT flow diagram showing enrollment, randomization, and vaccine allocation of participants over two influenza seasons (2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020) comparing cell culture\u2013derived IIV4 (cclIV4), recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4), and egg-derived IIV4 vaccines (Fluzone and Fluarix). It details numbers enrolled, completed visits, re-randomization, and exclusions. The figure is a participant flow diagram and does not present any immunogenicity or antibody response data comparing recombinant HA vaccines to egg-derived vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is adequate to determine content; however, no data on antibody levels or cross-reactivity are shown.",
