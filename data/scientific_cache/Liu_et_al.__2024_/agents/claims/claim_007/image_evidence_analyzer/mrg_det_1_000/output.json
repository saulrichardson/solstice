  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram showing participant enrollment, randomization, and follow-up in Year 1 (2018\u20132019) and Year 2 (2019\u20132020) across vaccine arms (cclIIV4, recombinant RIV4, Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4) and re-randomization in Year 2. The image is a participant flow diagram and does not present any immunogenicity or antibody response data comparing BEVS-derived recombinant HA antigens with egg-derived vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No antibody titer or cross-reactivity data are shown; the figure only depicts enrollment and vaccine allocation.",
