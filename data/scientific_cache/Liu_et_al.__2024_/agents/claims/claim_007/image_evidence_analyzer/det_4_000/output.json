  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise in microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A, B) and geometric mean fold reduction of antibody titers at 6 months post-vaccination (panels C, D) in two age groups (18\u201344 years, 45\u201364 years). Data are presented for four vaccines: Fluzone IIV4 (egg-derived, open circles), Fluarix IIV4 (black circles), ccIIV4 (cell culture\u2013derived, green circles), and RIV4 (recombinant HA, BEVS-derived, orange circles), tested against egg- and cell-propagated A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata antigens. P-values compare the geometric mean fold rises between vaccines for each antigen. The figure reports strain-specific HI and MN titer responses to egg- and cell-propagated viruses but does not measure or report levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies targeting highly conserved HA regions. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Data are clear on strain-specific antibody titers, but no assays for cross-reactivity to conserved HA epitopes are shown.",
