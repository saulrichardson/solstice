  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multipanel bar/scatter plots showing geometric mean fold-rise in antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and mean fold-reduction in titers at 6 months (panels C and D) for four quadrivalent influenza vaccines (egg-based Fluzone IIV4, egg-based Fluarix IIV4, cell-culture ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) against individual virus antigens (H3N2 egg/cell, H1N1 egg/cell, B/Victoria egg/cell, B/Yamagata egg/cell) in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). P values are annotated for pairwise comparisons. The figure compares homologous strain\u2013specific antibody responses to egg-, cell-, and recombinant-derived antigens but does not present data on broadly cross-reactive antibodies targeting highly conserved HA regions, so it does not support the claim. Note: Based solely on the visible data, no measures of cross-reactivity or conserved region responses are shown; the focus is on strain-matched HI titers.",
