  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza virus strains (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, B/Yamagada lineages) and showing amino acid differences at specific HA head domain positions for cell-derived, egg-derived, and egg CVV vaccine candidates across two years. does not support the claim because the table only presents amino acid sequence differences in HA head domains between cell- and egg-derived vaccine strains and provides no data on antibody induction or cross-reactive antibody levels. Note: Table content is clear, but limited to sequence comparisons; no immunogenicity or antibody response data are shown.",
