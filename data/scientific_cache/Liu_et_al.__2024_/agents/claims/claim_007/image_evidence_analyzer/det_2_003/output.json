  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine virus strains (by strain name and lineage), production method (cell-derived vs egg-derived candidate vaccine viruses), and the specific hemagglutinin (HA) amino acid substitutions observed at various HA residue positions for each strain. does not support the claim \u2014 the table only documents egg-adapted amino acid substitutions in HA for different cell- and egg-derived vaccine viruses and contains no data on recombinant HA produced in BEVS or any antibody response measurements. Note: The table is legible, but it provides sequence information only, with no immunogenicity or BEVS data to assess cross-reactive antibody levels.",
