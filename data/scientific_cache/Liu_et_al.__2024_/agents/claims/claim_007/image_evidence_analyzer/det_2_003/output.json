  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table listing influenza virus vaccine strains (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, B/Yamagata), production methods (cell, egg, egg CVV), and the specific amino acid differences at defined HA head domain positions between cell-derived and egg-derived viruses over different years. The table only presents amino acid changes in HA head domains between cell- and egg-derived vaccine seed viruses; it contains no data on recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS or antibody responses. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to sequence comparison data; no immunogenicity or BEVS information present.",
