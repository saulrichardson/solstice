  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial page from a medical paper showing background and summary text discussing repeat influenza vaccination, different vaccine platforms (egg-based IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4), sample sizes (N = 723), and exploratory analyses of A(H3N2) immunogenicity. No table data is visible. The image does not support the claim because it contains only descriptive text without any data demonstrating that BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens induce higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against conserved HA regions compared with egg-derived vaccines, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The content is truncated and no table is visible; relevant data may be located elsewhere in the document.",
