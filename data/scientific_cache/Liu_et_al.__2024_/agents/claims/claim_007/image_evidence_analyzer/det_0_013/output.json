  "explanation": "Partial page header and fragment of a medical/clinical table/text showing received, accepted, published dates and a cut-off excerpt of descriptive text; no data or comparison of BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens versus egg-derived vaccines. does not support the claim because the visible content contains only publication metadata and an incomplete text excerpt without presentation of any immunogenicity data comparing BEVS-derived versus egg-derived HA vaccines.
