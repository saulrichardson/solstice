  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) against four influenza virus strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) measured at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination. Data are stratified by age group (18\u201344 years, 45\u201364 years) and by virus growth substrate (egg-grown virus vs. cell-grown virus). Each panel compares four vaccine formulations: two egg-derived inactivated vaccines (Fluzone IIV4 in black, Fluviral IIV4 in blue), a cell culture\u2013derived inactivated vaccine (ccIIV4 in green), and a recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4 in orange). Individual data points and mean\u2009\u00b1\u200995% CI are plotted, with p-values indicating significant differences between vaccine groups at each time point. does not support the claim because the figure presents strain\u2010specific MN and HI titers against whole virus isolates, without any data on broadly cross\u2010reactive antibodies to conserved HA regions, nor a clear superiority of recombinant HA vaccines over egg\u2010derived vaccines in generating cross\u2010reactive responses. Note: The figure quality is sufficient to interpret vaccine comparisons and titer measurements, but it lacks any direct assessment of broadly cross\u2010reactive or conserved\u2010region HA antibody responses.",
