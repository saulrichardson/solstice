  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel graphs showing geometric mean microneutralization (MN) titers (log2 scale) for A(H3N2) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (log2 scale) for A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria (B/VIC), and B/Yamagata (B/YAM) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination. Four vaccine groups are compared: Fluzone IIV4 (egg-derived), Fluarix IIV4 (egg-derived), cell-propagated cclIV4, and recombinant RIV4. Individual titers are shown as gray dots, with GMTs and 95% confidence intervals, and statistically significant differences between groups indicated by p values on horizontal bars. does not support the claim: the figure reports strain-specific neutralization and HI titers for four vaccine formulations but does not assess broadly cross-reactive antibodies directed against conserved HA regions, nor directly compare the breadth of responses from BEVS-derived recombinant HA versus egg-based vaccines. Note: No epitope specificity or cross-reactivity breadth data are presented; conclusions are limited to strain-specific immunogenicity.",
