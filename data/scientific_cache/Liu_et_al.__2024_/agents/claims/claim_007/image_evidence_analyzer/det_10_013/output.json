  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing demographic characteristics and prior influenza vaccination history of study participants across four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4), including sample sizes (n), mean age (SD), age group distribution, sex, race/ethnicity, study site, and receipt of influenza vaccines in prior seasons. The table only presents baseline demographic data and prior vaccination history for different vaccine cohorts and contains no immunogenicity or antibody response measurements. Therefore, it does not support the claim regarding broadly cross-reactive antibody induction by recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS versus egg-derived vaccines. Note: The image quality is sufficient to read all demographic data; no relevant immunogenicity data are present.",
