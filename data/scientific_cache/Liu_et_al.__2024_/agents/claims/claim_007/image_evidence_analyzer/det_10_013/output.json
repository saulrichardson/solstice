  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A demographic and site characteristics table showing participant numbers (n and %) by vaccine group (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4), including mean age, age groups, sex, race/ethnicity, study sites, and prior influenza vaccination history. does not support the claim because the table only presents demographic and prior vaccination history data for different influenza vaccine groups, without any information on antibody responses or cross-reactivity to HA regions. Note: Table lacks immunogenicity or antibody titer data; image quality adequate to determine absence of relevant evidence.",
