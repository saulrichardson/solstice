  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing the demographic characteristics (mean age, age groups, sex, race, study site, and influenza vaccination history) of participants in four study groups (n=122, 120, 283, 198). The image contains only participant demographic data and no immunogenicity or antibody response results comparing BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens with egg-derived vaccines, so it does not support the claim.",
