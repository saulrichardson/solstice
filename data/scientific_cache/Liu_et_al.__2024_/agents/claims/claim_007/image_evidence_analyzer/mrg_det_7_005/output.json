  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A grid of box\u2010and\u2010whisker plots showing hemagglutination\u2010inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) against four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination. Data are stratified by age group (18\u201344 yrs and 45\u201364 yrs) and by whether the HI assay used egg-grown or cell-grown virus. Each colored symbol set represents one of several vaccine formulations, including cell-culture-derived inactivated vaccine (ccIIV4), recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4), and egg-based inactivated vaccine (IIV4), with p-value comparisons indicated between some groups. The figure presents strain-specific HI titers measured against egg- or cell-grown viruses for different vaccines, but it does not assess broadly cross-reactive antibodies targeting conserved HA regions or directly compare BEVS-derived recombinant HA to egg-derived vaccines on that basis; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Limited by small font sizes and lack of direct measurement of antibody breadth or conserved-region specificity; group labels and p-value annotations are difficult to interpret in detail.",
