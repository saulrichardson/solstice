  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Box-and-whisker plots showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination for four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Data are stratified by age group (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) and seven repeat vaccination arms comparing cell-based inactivated vaccine (ccIIV4), recombinant vaccine (RIV4), and egg-based inactivated vaccine (IIV4) in various sequences. Gray dots represent individual titers; geometric mean titers with 95% CIs are shown and p-values denote significant differences between arms. The figure presents HI titers for different vaccine regimens but does not measure broadly cross-reactive antibodies targeting highly conserved HA regions nor directly compare BEVS-derived recombinant HA to egg-derived vaccines in that context. Therefore it does not support the claim.",
