  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Multi\u2010panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers against influenza HA. Panel A compares egg\u2010derived versus cell\u2010derived whole\u2010virus HA titers at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IV4, Fluarix IV4, ccIV4, RIV4). Panel B shows the geometric mean ratio of egg versus cell HA titers at 1 month. Panel C shows H3 and H1 stalk\u2010specific ELISA titers (Log2 scale) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months for the same four groups. Panel D shows the geometric mean fold\u2010rise in stalk titers (1 month/Day 0) for H3 and H1 stalk. Evidence: In Panels C and D, the RIV4 group exhibits significantly higher H3 and H1 stalk ELISA titers and fold\u2010rise at 1 month compared with the egg\u2010derived vaccine groups (p<0.05). supports the claim Note: Some p\u2010value labels are small and partially overlapping; group identities and exact p\u2010value pairings are inferred by color coding but overall trends are clear.",
