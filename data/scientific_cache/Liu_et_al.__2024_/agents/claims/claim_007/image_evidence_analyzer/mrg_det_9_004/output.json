  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (Log2 scale) against influenza HA antigens. Panel A compares egg-derived versus cell-derived whole HA antigens for H3N2, H1N1, B/VIC, and B/YAM strains at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination in seven vaccination regimens (cell-culture IIV4, recombinant RIV4, and egg-based IIV4 combinations). Panel B shows geometric mean ratios of egg to cell HA ELISA titers. Panel C shows ELISA titers to the conserved H3 and H1 HA stalk domains at Day 0 and 1 month, with p-values and asterisks indicating significant differences. Panel D shows geometric mean fold-rise in stalk ELISA titers (1 month/Day 0) for H3 and H1 stalk across the same regimens. Evidence: In Panel C, RIV4-containing arms (e.g., RIV4-RIV4) exhibit significantly higher H1 stalk ELISA titers at 1 month compared with the IIV4-IIV4 arm (p = 0.017), and in Panel D, RIV4-RIV4 shows a greater stalk titer fold-rise than egg-derived IIV4. The figure shows that recombinant HA antigen produced by BEVS (RIV4) induces significantly higher levels of cross-reactive stalk-specific antibodies compared with the egg-derived IIV4 arm, which supports the claim. Note: Resolution of arm labels and exact p-value comparisons rely on the legend; however, significant p-values for stalk responses in RIV4 groups versus IIV4 are clearly indicated.",
