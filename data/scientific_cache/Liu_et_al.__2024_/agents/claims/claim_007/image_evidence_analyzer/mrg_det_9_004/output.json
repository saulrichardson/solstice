  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing ELISA titers (log2 scale) of head and stalk binding antibody responses at day 0 and one month after vaccination across seven vaccination arms. Panels A include head-binding titers for H3N2, pH1N1, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata antigens. Panel B shows ratios of egg-derived to cell-derived HA ELISA titers expressed as geometric mean fold change. Panel C shows stalk-binding antibody titers for H3 and H1 stalk regions at day 0 and one month. Panel D shows geometric mean fold-rise of stalk ELISA titers (1 month/day 0) for H3 and H1. Vaccination arms include combinations of cell culture\u2013derived IIV4 (cclIV4), recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4), and egg-derived inactivated vaccine (IIV4). The figure presents within-group pre- versus post-vaccination increases in stalk antibody titers and ratios of egg to cell HA titers but does not show direct comparisons between BEVS-produced recombinant HA (RIV4) and egg-derived vaccine (IIV4) groups for cross-reactive stalk antibodies. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Image text is small and partly crowded, but key comparisons between vaccine groups are not indicated. No direct statistical comparison of recombinant versus egg-derived groups is shown.",
