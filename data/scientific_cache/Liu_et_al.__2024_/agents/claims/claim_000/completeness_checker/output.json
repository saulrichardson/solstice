      "relevance_explanation": "This quote identifies Flublok (RIV4) as a recombinant influenza vaccine, which is relevant because recombinant vaccines are produced without eggs, allowing for precise matching to the selected strains without egg-adapted mutations."

Sequences were analyzed against the sequences of candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) of the study vaccines as deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database by BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 (Table 1).",

The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes that the recombinant HA proteins used in Flublok (RIV4) are produced from both egg- and cell-propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens, and that these are expressed using a baculovirus system. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match to the WHO- and FDA-selected strains, as the recombinant proteins are based directly on the selected reference sequences, not subject to egg-adaptive mutations.",
