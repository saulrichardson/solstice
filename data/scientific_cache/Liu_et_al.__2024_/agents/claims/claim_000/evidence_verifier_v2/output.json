      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote identifies Flublok (RIV4) as a recombinant influenza vaccine, which is relevant because recombinant vaccines are produced without eggs and thus can ensure an identical antigenic match to the selected strains, as opposed to egg-based vaccines that may acquire adaptive mutations."

      "original_explanation": "This quote confirms that Flublok's HA antigens are produced recombinantly (not in eggs), which is necessary for ensuring an exact match to the WHO- and FDA-selected strains, as no egg-adaptive mutations can occur."
