      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote identifies Flublok (RIV4) as a recombinant influenza vaccine, which is relevant because recombinant vaccines are produced without eggs and thus do not acquire egg-adapted mutations, supporting the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match to the selected strains."

      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote describes the production of recombinant HA proteins for Flublok using a baculovirus system, which is a non-egg-based method. This supports the claim by indicating that the antigens in Flublok are not subject to egg-adapted changes and thus match the WHO- and FDA-selected strains."

      "quote": "Twenty percent of participants were selected by random sampling from each vaccine group and age strata (18\u221244 yrs and 45\u221264 yrs) in year 1 (n = 144) and year 2 (n = 140), the MN/HI antibody levels of the subset are representative of the whole study populations in year 1 (Fig. S3) and year 2 (Fig. S4). These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from both egg and cell propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens), and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk, and A (H3 N2) HA stalk). rHA from egg- and cell A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1 N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3 N2), B/ Colorado 06 2017 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 1 sera; rHA from egg- A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1 N1) pdm09 and cell-A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1 N1) pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3 N2), egg- and cell- B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/ Victoria), egg- and cell-B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 2 sera.",
