      "explanation": "Multi-panel ELISA data showing total HA head and stalk antibody responses to egg-propagated and cell-propagated influenza virus HA at pre-vaccination, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIIV4, Fluarix IIIV4, cell-based IV4, and RIV4). Panel B presents geometric mean ratios of egg HA vs cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month for H3, H1, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata HAs. Evidence: In Panel B, RIV4 (Flublok) shows egg/cell HA ELISA titer ratios close to 1 for both H3 and H1 HA, indicating equivalent binding to egg- and cell-derived antigens. The near-unity egg/cell HA titer ratios for RIV4 demonstrate no antigenic difference between vaccine HA and WHO/FDA-selected HA antigens, which supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match. Note: Data are limited to the strains tested and timepoints shown; the figure does not explicitly reference WHO or FDA selection criteria.",
