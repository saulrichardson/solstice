  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing (A, B) geometric mean ratios of egg-propagated to cell-propagated virus titers (with 95% CIs and p-values) and (C, D) proportions of \u22654-fold reduced titers to cell vaccine virus, stratified by age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) and influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) for four vaccine types: egg-based IIV4 (Fluzone, Fluarix), cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant HA RIV4 (Flublok). The figure presents comparative antigenic data for different vaccines but does not demonstrate that Flublok (RIV4) has an identical antigenic match to the WHO- or FDA-selected strains; it shows non-unity titer ratios and significant reductions, so it does not support the claim Note: Image panels are clear but strain selection context and regulatory labeling (WHO/FDA) are not shown; analysis limited to data presented",
