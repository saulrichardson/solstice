  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure (A\u2013D) comparing immunogenicity measures for four influenza vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-based IIV4, and recombinant RIV4) in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). Panels A and B show geometric mean ratios of egg-grown versus cell-grown vaccine virus titers against A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains. Panels C and D show the proportion of subjects with \u22654-fold reduced titers to cell-grown virus post-vaccination. Specific p-values and percentage changes are annotated for A(H3N2) comparisons. does not support the claim because the figure presents immunogenicity comparisons between egg- and cell-grown antigens for different vaccines but does not address WHO or FDA strain selection or demonstrate identical antigenic match for Flublok. Note: No mention of WHO- or FDA-selected strains in the figure; conclusions are limited to the visible immunogenicity data.",
