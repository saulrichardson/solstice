  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Four-panel figure (A\u2013D) showing serologic data for four influenza vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-based IIV4, and RIV4) in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Panels A and B plot the geometric mean ratio of egg-derived to cell-derived virus antibody titers at one month post-vaccination for four strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) with 95% CIs and p-values comparing vaccine groups. Panels C and D show the proportion of subjects with \u22654-fold reductions in titer to egg-derived vs cell-derived virus at pre- and post-vaccination for each vaccine and strain. The figure presents comparative antibody titer ratios and fold-reduction data but does not provide any direct information about antigenic sequence matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. It does not support the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. Note: Analysis limited to what is visible; figure focuses on serologic cross-reactivity rather than genetic or antigenic sequence matching.",
