  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing immune response titers (microneutralization and hemagglutination inhibition on a log2 scale) against four influenza virus strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) propagated in egg or cell culture. Data are stratified by age group (18\u201344\u2009yrs and 45\u201364\u2009yrs) and timepoint (Day\u20090, 1\u2009month, 6\u2009months) for four vaccine formulations (egg-based FluZone IV4, egg-based Fluarix IV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant hemagglutinin RIV4/Flublok). Individual data points, group means with error bars, and p-values comparing titers are shown. The figure presents immunogenicity (antibody titer) comparisons against egg- and cell-propagated viruses but does not include any data on the antigenic sequence or direct antigenic matching of Flublok to the WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Therefore, it does not support the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match. Note: Analysis is limited to the visible immunogenicity data; no antigenic characterization (e.g., sequence or antigenic mapping) is shown.",
