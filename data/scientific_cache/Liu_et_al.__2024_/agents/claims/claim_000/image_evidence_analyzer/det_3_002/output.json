  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) against four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in age groups 18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years. Titers are measured at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine formulations (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-based IIV4, recombinant RIV4), with statistical comparisons indicated between groups and time points. The figure presents immunogenicity data (antibody titers) but does not provide any information on antigenic sequence matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clear in its measurement of antibody responses but contains no data on antigenic match or confirmatory sequence comparisons.",
