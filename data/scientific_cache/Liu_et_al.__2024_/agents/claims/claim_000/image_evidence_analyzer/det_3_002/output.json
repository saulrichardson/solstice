  "explanation": "Multi\u2010panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) for four vaccine formulations (Fluzone IV-IV, Fluarix IV-IV, cclIV4, RIV4) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years) against egg-grown versus cell-grown viruses for influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata at Day 0, Month 1, and Month 6. The figure presents comparative antibody titers but does not provide any data on antigenic or sequence matching between Flublok and WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Cannot assess antigenic match from immunogenicity titers alone; no direct antigenic mapping or sequence data are shown.",
