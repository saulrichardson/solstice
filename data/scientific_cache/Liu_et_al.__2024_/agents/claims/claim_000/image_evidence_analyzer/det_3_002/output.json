  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination against four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4). Each panel displays geometric mean titers with 95% confidence intervals and individual data points, with p-values indicating statistical differences between groups. The figure provides immunogenicity data but contains no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Based solely on visible data; no mention of antigenic match or WHO/FDA strain selection in the image.",
