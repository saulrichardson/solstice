  "explanation": "A table presenting demographic characteristics and influenza vaccination history for participants across four study groups (n=122, n=120, n=283, n=198), including mean age, age group breakdowns, sex, race/ethnicity, study site distribution, and prior influenza vaccination history. The table provides only participant demographics and vaccination history; it does not address antigenic match between Flublok and WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image shows only baseline demographic and history data; no antigenic or strain match information is visible.",
