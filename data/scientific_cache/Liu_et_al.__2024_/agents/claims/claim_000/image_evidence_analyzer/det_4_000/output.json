  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

  "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold rises in hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and mean fold reductions at 6 months post-vaccination (panels C and D) for two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Data are plotted for four vaccines (egg-based Fluzone IIV4, egg-based Fluarix IIV4, cell-culture ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4 [Flublok]) against egg- and cell-derived antigens for multiple influenza strains (H3N2, H1N1, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). P values compare responses across vaccines. The figure presents immunogenicity data and does not address antigenic matching between Flublok and WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains; it therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible immunogenicity results; no direct antigenic match data are shown in the image.",
