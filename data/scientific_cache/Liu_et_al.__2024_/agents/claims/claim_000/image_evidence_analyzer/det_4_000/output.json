  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Graphical presentation of immunogenicity data showing geometric mean fold rise in antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and geometric mean fold reduction of titers at 6 months post-vaccination (panels C and D) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). The vaccines compared are egg-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone IIV4), Fluarix IIV4, cell-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV4), and recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok) against egg- and cell-derived H3N2, H1N1, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains. The figure does not support the claim because it only presents antibody titer responses and waning over time for RIV4 versus other vaccine formulations; it does not provide any data or statements about antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, so it doesn't support the claim.",
