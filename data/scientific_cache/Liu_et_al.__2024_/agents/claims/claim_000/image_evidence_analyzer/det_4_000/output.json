  "explanation": "Figure with four panels (A\u2013D) showing geometric mean fold rise (panels A and B) and fold reduction (panels C and D) of antibody titers at 1 month and 6 months post\u2010vaccination, respectively, in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). Titers are measured against egg-propagated and cell-propagated H3N2, H1N1, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses for four vaccines: Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4 (Flublok). Data include point estimates with 95% CIs and p-values comparing egg versus cell antigens within each vaccine group. does not support the claim because the figure presents immunogenicity comparisons against egg- and cell-propagated viruses but provides no data or statements on antigenic sequence match to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, nor does it demonstrate identical antigenic composition. Note: Image does not include any mention of WHO/FDA strain selection or direct antigenic match data; comparisons focus solely on immunogenicity outcomes.",
