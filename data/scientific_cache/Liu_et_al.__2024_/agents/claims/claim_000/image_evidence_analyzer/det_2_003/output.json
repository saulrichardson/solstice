  "explanation": "Table listing amino acid residues at selected hemagglutinin positions for various influenza vaccine viruses (cell-derived, egg-derived, and egg-adapted candidate vaccine viruses) across H1N1, H3N2, Victoria lineage B, and Yamagata lineage B strains, highlighting egg-adaptive substitutions and glycosylation motif losses. The table documents egg-adapted amino acid substitutions in egg-based and cell-based vaccine viruses but does not present any data on Flublok (recombinant HA vaccine) or its antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Image is legible; table is focused on egg adaptation and does not mention Flublok or recombinant vaccine matching outcomes.",
