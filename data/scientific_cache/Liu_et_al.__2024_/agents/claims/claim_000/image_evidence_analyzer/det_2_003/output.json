  "explanation": "A table summarizing amino acid differences on the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain at specific residue positions for various WHO- and FDA-selected influenza A (H1N1, H3N2) and B (Victoria, Yamagata) strains, comparing cell-based, egg-based, and candidate vaccine virus (CVV) seed variants over two seasons. The table details amino acid differences among vaccine seed strains propagated in cells, eggs, or as CVVs, but does not mention Flublok or demonstrate that Flublok antigens exactly match WHO- and FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis based solely on visible table content; no reference to Flublok is present in the image.",
