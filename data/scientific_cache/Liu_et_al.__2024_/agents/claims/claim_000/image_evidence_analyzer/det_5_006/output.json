  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel ELISA immunogenicity figure comparing four quadrivalent influenza vaccines (two egg-based, one cell-based, one recombinant [RIV4/Flublok]) across HA antigens. Panel A shows log\u2082 ELISA titers against egg-grown and cell-grown H3N2, H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata HA at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months. Panel B shows geometric mean ratios of egg-to-cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month for H3, H1, B/VIC, and B/YAM strains. Panel C shows log\u2082 ELISA titers against H3 and H1 stalk antigens over time. Panel D shows geometric mean fold-rise in stalk titers (1 month vs Day 0). Comparisons between vaccines are annotated with p-values. The figure reports immunogenicity metrics for Flublok (RIV4) versus other vaccines against egg- and cell-derived HA and stalk antigens. It does not present data on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis based solely on visible data; the figure focuses on ELISA titers and fold-rises, not sequence or antigenic matching.",
