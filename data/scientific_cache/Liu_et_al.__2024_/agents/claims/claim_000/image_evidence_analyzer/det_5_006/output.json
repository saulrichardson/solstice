  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel ELISA immunogenicity data comparing four quadrivalent influenza vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4/Flublok) against egg-propagated and cell-propagated hemagglutinin (HA) antigens of A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination. Panel B shows geometric mean ratios of egg-to-cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month; Panels C and D show stalk-specific ELISA titers and fold-rise respectively. The figure presents immune response (ELISA titers) against egg versus cell virus HA but does not provide direct evidence of antigenic sequence identity between Flublok antigens and WHO- or FDA-selected reference strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis based solely on visible panels; small font and resolution may limit precise reading of all statistical annotations.",
