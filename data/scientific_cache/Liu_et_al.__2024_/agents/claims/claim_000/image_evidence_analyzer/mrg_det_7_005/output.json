  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination against both egg-propagated and cell-propagated influenza vaccine viruses (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Data are plotted as geometric mean titers with 95% confidence intervals for seven different repeat vaccination arms (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-IIV4). P values for pairwise comparisons between arms are indicated. The figure presents immunogenicity (HI titer) comparisons among different vaccine regimens but does not provide data or direct evidence on the antigenic identity or match of Flublok (RIV4) to WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to HI titer data; no sequence or antigenic characterization is shown.",
