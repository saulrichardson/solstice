  "explanation": "Sixteen panel figure showing hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) against four influenza virus strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) at Day 0 and one month post-vaccination, with assays performed using egg-grown versus cell-grown virus and multiple vaccine group color-coded symbols with error bars and p-value annotations. The figure presents immunogenicity data (HI titers) comparing egg-grown versus cell-grown virus assays; it does not provide any direct evidence of antigenic match between Flublok antigens and WHO- or FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Interpretation limited to what is visually presented; no sequence or binding data to assess antigenic identity are shown.",
