  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination in adults aged 18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years, measured using egg-grown or cell-grown influenza viruses for subtypes A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. Colored symbols represent different vaccine formulations and pairwise p-values are indicated for some comparisons. does not support the claim because the figure only presents immunogenicity (HI titer) data against egg- and cell-grown viruses for different vaccines and does not provide any information on antigenic match between Flublok and WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Note: Image resolution limits reading of small text, but no direct data on antigenic matching are visible.",
