  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multipanel figure showing ELISA antibody binding titers (log2 scale) to hemagglutinin (HA) from egg-propagated and cell-propagated influenza A (H3N2, H1N1pdm09) and influenza B (B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) viruses at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination across seven vaccine group combinations (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-IIV4). Panel B shows geometric mean ratios of egg versus cell HA ELISA titers. Panel C shows stalk-specific ELISA titers for H3 and H1 stalks. Panel D shows fold-rise in stalk titers at 1 month relative to Day 0. The figure presents immune response data comparing antibody binding to egg- and cell-derived HA and stalk antigens after different vaccine regimens. It does not provide any direct information on the antigenic match between Flublok and the WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No mention of WHO or FDA strain selection in the figure; data are limited to antibody titers and do not address antigen sequence or match directly.",
