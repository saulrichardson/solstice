  "explanation": "Multipanel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) against egg-derived and cell-derived hemagglutinin (HA) from influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains measured at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination; panel B shows geometric mean ratio of egg versus cell HA titers; panel C shows stalk-specific ELISA titers for H3 and H1 stalks; panel D shows geometric mean fold-rise of stalk titers. Data are plotted for various vaccine sequences (combinations of cell-based IIV4, egg-based IIV4, and recombinant RIV4), with p-values annotated for some comparisons. The figure presents immunogenicity data comparing antibody responses to egg- versus cell-derived HA and stalk antigens for different vaccine formulations, but it does not provide any information on antigenic matching of Flublok to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Image text is small; no explicit mention of strain selection or antigenic match criteria is shown.",
