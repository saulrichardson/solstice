  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multiple ELISA titer graphs showing head (HA) and stalk binding antibody responses (log\u2082 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination across seven different repeat vaccination arms (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-IIV4) for H3N2, pH1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata head antigens, plus stalk ELISA titers and fold-rise ratios. The figure only shows antibody titer responses measured by ELISA for different vaccine formulations and does not present any data on antigenic composition or direct matching of Flublok to WHO- or FDA-selected strains; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to the visible figure; no antigenic match data or strain composition details are shown.",
