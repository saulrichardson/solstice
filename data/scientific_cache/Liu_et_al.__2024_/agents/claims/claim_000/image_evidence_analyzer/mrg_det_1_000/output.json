It details numbers enrolled, completed visits at day 0, 1 month, and 6 months, and re-randomization into various vaccine sequences in Year 2. does not support the claim because this figure is solely a participant flow diagram and provides no information on antigenic match or strain composition for Flublok or any vaccine to WHO- or FDA-selected strains.
