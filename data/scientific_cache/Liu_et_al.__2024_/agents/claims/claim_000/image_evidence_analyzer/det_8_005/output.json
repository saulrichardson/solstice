  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

  "explanation": "Two-panel figure showing proportions of subjects (age groups 18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) achieving \u22654-fold reduction in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against cell\u2010derived vaccine virus for four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Each panel compares pre- and post-vaccination responses in seven vaccine sequence groups (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-Fluzone IIV4). p-values indicate statistical comparisons for select strain/regimen combinations. The figure presents immunogenicity data without any information on antigenic match or regulatory strain selection, so it does not support the claim Note: No mention of WHO or FDA strain selection or direct antigenic matching in the image; resolution is sufficient to see that this content is immunogenicity data only.",
