Seven different Year 1\u2013Year 2 vaccination sequences (ccIIV4, RIV4, IIV4, Fluzone combinations) are compared, with p-values indicating statistically significant changes between pre- and post-vaccination. does not support the claim because the figure presents immunogenicity (egg/cell HI titer ratios) across vaccine types and age groups, and does not provide any data on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains.
