  "explanation": "A multi\u2010panel figure showing pre\u2010 and post\u2010vaccination hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses (proportion with \u22654-fold titer increases) against four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Different symbols/colors represent various vaccine sequence groups (e.g., cell-culture IIV4 followed by itself, IIV4 followed by RIV4, RIV4 followed by IIV4, Fluzone IIV4, etc.). does not support the claim because the figure reports immunogenicity outcomes (HAI titer changes) after different vaccine regimens but does not present any data or statements about antigenic matching of Flublok to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Note: Analysis limited to visible data; the figure does not address antigenic match or strain identity directly.",
