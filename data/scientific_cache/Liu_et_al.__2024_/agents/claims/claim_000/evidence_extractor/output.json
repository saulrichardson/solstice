      "relevance_explanation": "This quote identifies Flublok (RIV4) as a recombinant influenza vaccine, which is relevant because recombinant vaccines are produced without eggs and thus can ensure an antigenic match to the intended strains, as selected by WHO and FDA, without egg-adapted mutations."

Sequences were analyzed against the sequences of candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) of the study vaccines as deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database by BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 (Table 1).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that the antigens in the vaccines, including Flublok, were directly compared to the WHO- and FDA-selected candidate vaccine virus sequences, supporting the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match."

      "quote": "These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from both egg and cell propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens), and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A (H1N1) pdm09 HA stalk, and A (H3N2) HA stalk). The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote confirms that the recombinant HA proteins used in Flublok are produced in a baculovirus system, which does not introduce egg-adapted mutations, thus ensuring the antigenic match to the WHO- and FDA-selected strains."
