      "relevance_explanation": "This quote identifies Flublok (RIV4) as a recombinant influenza vaccine, which is relevant because recombinant vaccines are produced without eggs and thus do not acquire egg-adapted mutations, supporting the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match to the selected strains."

      "quote": "The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures 45. For ELISA, rHA antigens were coated at 100 ng/well.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes the production of recombinant HA proteins for Flublok using a baculovirus system, which is a non-egg-based method. This supports the claim by indicating that the antigens in Flublok are not subject to egg-adapted changes and thus match the WHO- and FDA-selected strains."

Sequences were analyzed against the sequences of candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) of the study vaccines as deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database by BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 (Table 1).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that the vaccine antigens, including those in Flublok, were sequence-verified against the official candidate vaccine virus sequences, supporting the claim that Flublok matches the WHO- and FDA-selected strains."
