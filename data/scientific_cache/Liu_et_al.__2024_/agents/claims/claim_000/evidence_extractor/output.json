      "relevance_explanation": "This quote identifies Flublok (RIV4) as a recombinant influenza vaccine, which is relevant because recombinant vaccines are produced without eggs and thus can ensure an identical antigenic match to the selected strains, as opposed to egg-based vaccines that may acquire adaptive mutations."

Sequences were analyzed against the sequences of candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) of the study vaccines as deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database by BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 (Table 1).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that the antigens in the vaccines, including Flublok, were directly compared to the reference strains selected by WHO and FDA, supporting the claim that Flublok can ensure an identical antigenic match."

      "relevance_explanation": "This quote confirms that Flublok's HA antigens are produced recombinantly (not in eggs), which is necessary for ensuring an exact match to the WHO- and FDA-selected strains, as no egg-adaptive mutations can occur."
