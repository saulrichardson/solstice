  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial snapshot of page 1 text from a clinical paper, showing paragraphs about repeat influenza vaccination, an exploratory analysis of A(H3N2) immunogenicity in trial NCT03722589, mention of egg-based IIV4 (N=723), and vaccine groups labeled cclIV4 and RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent vaccine), but no brand names or tabulated data. The image shows introductory text mentioning RIV4 and egg-based IIV4 groups but makes no reference to Fluarix or a pivotal trial comparing Flublok quadrivalent to Fluarix quadrivalent, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is a text fragment without a visible table or brand names, so it may not capture the full context or relevant data if truncated.",
