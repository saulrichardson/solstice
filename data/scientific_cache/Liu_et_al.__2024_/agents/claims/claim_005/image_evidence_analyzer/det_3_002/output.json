  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A multipanel figure showing geometric mean antibody titers (log2 scale) against four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) using egg-grown or cell-grown viruses. Four vaccine groups are plotted at Day 0, Month 1, and Month 6: Fluzone IIV4 (black), Fluarix IIV4 (blue), ccIIV4 (green), and RIV4 (orange). Pairwise p-values comparing vaccine groups are annotated above the points. Evidence: The figure directly plots and statistically compares RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) versus Fluarix IIV4 (quadrivalent standard-dose) antibody responses across all strains and timepoints. The figure supports the claim by showing head-to-head immunogenicity comparisons between RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) and Fluarix IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent) in the pivotal trial context. Note: The figure does not explicitly label this as the pivotal trial, and full study design details are not visible, so attribution to the specific pivotal study is inferred but not spelled out.",
