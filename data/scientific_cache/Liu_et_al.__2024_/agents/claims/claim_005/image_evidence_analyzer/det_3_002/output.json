  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) antibody titers at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination in two age cohorts (18\u201344 yrs and 45\u201364 yrs) against egg- and cell-derived influenza viruses (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Four vaccine groups are plotted in different colors: Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4. Evidence: The figure includes immunogenicity data for both RIV4 (orange, i.e., Flublok quadrivalent) and Fluarix IIV4 (blue) arms, with direct side-by-side comparisons and p-values between them. The figure supports the claim by showing head-to-head immunogenicity comparisons of RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) versus Fluarix IIV4 in the pivotal trial data. Note: Exact trial naming (\u2018pivotal\u2019) is not visible in the figure legend; assumed based on context that these are pivotal immunogenicity results.",
