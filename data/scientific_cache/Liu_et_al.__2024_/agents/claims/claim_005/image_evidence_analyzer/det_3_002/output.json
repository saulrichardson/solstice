  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-based IIV4, and RIV4) against A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria (B/VIC), and B/Yamagata (B/YAM) strains. Evidence: The figure includes RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine, i.e., Flublok) and Fluarix IIV4 groups with direct statistical comparisons of antibody responses at each time point. supports the claim because the pivotal trial data shown directly compares RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine). Note: None",
