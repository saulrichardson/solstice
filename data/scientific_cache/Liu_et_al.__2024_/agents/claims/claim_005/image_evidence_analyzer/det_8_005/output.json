  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two sets of pre- and post-vaccination line graphs showing the proportion of participants with \u22654-fold reduced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer egg/cell ratio across four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM) for two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Seven Year 1\u2013Year 2 repeat vaccination arms are plotted with distinct symbols and colors: ccIIV4\u2192ccIIV4, ccIIV4\u2192RIV4, RIV4\u2192ccIIV4, RIV4\u2192RIV4, IIV4\u2192ccIIV4, IIV4\u2192RIV4, and IIV4\u2192Fluzone IIV4. P values annotate significant pre-to-post changes for certain strains. Evidence: Legend shows IIV4\u2192Fluzone IIV4 as the egg-based standard-dose comparator; no Fluarix quadrivalent is mentioned. The figure compares RIV4 (Flublok) against Fluzone IIV4, ccIIV4, and IIV4, but does not include Fluarix quadrivalent, so it does not support the claim Note: Resolution allows reading of legend and vaccine arm labels; absence of Fluarix is clear.",
