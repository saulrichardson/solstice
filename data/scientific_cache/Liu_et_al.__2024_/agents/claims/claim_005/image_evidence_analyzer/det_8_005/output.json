  "explanation": "The figure is a two\u2010panel bar/line plot showing the proportion of participants achieving \u22654\u2010fold increases in hemagglutination inhibition titers against cell\u2010grown vaccine virus strains in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). For each strain (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM), pre\u2010 and post\u2010vaccination values are plotted for seven vaccine sequence groups: ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, and IIV4-Fluzone IIV4. does not support the claim because the figure compares cell-based (ccIIV4), recombinant (RIV4, i.e. Flublok), and egg-based Fluzone IIV4 sequences but does not include Fluarix (quadrivalent) as a comparator. Note: The figure legend and labels are clear; no mention of Fluarix IIV4 is visible.",
