  "explanation": "A two-panel figure showing immunogenicity (proportion of \u22654-fold HAI titer rise) against four influenza strains in adults aged 18\u201344 (Panel A) and 45\u201364 years (Panel B). Data points and lines represent various prime-boost sequences using cell-culture-derived quadrivalent IIV (ccIIV4), recombinant HA quadrivalent vaccine (RIV4), and standard egg-based quadrivalent IIV (IIV4, notably Fluzone IIV4). A legend identifies seven different vaccine sequence groups with distinct symbols and colors. does not support the claim because the figure compares RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine) against ccIIV4 and Fluzone IIV4 sequences but does not include or mention Fluarix quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine or a direct Flublok vs Fluarix comparison Note: Image resolution limits ruling out small text, but no mention of Fluarix or a pivotal head-to-head Flublok vs Fluarix trial is visible.",
