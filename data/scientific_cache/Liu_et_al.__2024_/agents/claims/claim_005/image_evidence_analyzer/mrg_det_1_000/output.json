  "explanation": "CONSORT diagram for Year 2 (2019\u20132020) screening and enrollment of participants, showing numbers re-enrolled from Year 1 and new enrollees randomized into arms labeled IIV4 (inactivated influenza vaccine: Fluzone\u00ae or Fluarix\u00ae Quadrivalent), ccIIV4 (cell culture\u2013based IIV4), and RIV4 (recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine, Flublok\u00ae Quadrivalent), with subsequent re-randomization into various vaccine sequences. does not support the claim because the figure only depicts enrollment and randomization into IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4 arms without presenting a clear, direct head-to-head evaluation of Flublok\u00ae Quadrivalent against Fluarix\u00ae Quadrivalent in a pivotal trial. Note: The diagram focuses on participant flow and vaccine sequence arms; it does not include study outcomes or explicit mention of a pivotal comparison between Flublok and Fluarix.",
