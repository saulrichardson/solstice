  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "CONSORT diagram of a two\u2010year clinical trial. Year 1 (2018\u20132019) shows 723 participants randomized into four vaccine arms: cell\u2010culture quadrivalent influenza vaccine (ccIIV4, n=283), recombinant\u2010hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV4, n=198), Fluzone standard\u2010dose quadrivalent (Fluzone IIV4, n=122), and Fluarix standard\u2010dose quadrivalent (Fluarix IIV4, n=120). The diagram also details completion rates at 1 and 6 months and re\u2010enrollment in Year 2, with subsequent re\u2010randomization into various vaccine sequences. Evidence: Year 1 vaccine allocation includes an RIV4 arm (n=198) and a Fluarix IIV4 arm (n=120), indicating they were evaluated in the same pivotal trial. The diagram shows RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) and Fluarix IIV4 arms randomized and compared in the pivotal trial, which supports the claim. Note: RIV4 corresponds to the recombinant quadrivalent vaccine (Flublok) although the brand name is not explicitly shown in the figure.",
