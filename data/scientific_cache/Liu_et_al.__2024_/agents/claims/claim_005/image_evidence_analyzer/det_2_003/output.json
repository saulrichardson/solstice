  "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table listing influenza virus strains (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) by year and passage (cell, egg, CVV) alongside amino acid differences at specified HA head domain positions. The table presents viral strain identities and HA amino acid changes but makes no reference to Flublok, Fluarix, or any pivotal clinical trial comparing these vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim.
