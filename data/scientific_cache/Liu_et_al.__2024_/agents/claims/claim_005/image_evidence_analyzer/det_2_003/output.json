  "explanation": "A table showing amino acid differences on the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain at specified residue positions for various influenza virus strains (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria lineage, B/Yamagata lineage) across different years and propagation methods (cell vs egg), with strain names and codon changes listed. The table presents sequence differences of viral HA proteins and contains no information about clinical vaccine trials or comparisons between Flublok and Fluarix; it does not support the claim. Note: The image only includes amino acid difference data and does not reference any vaccine evaluation or trial design, limiting relevance to the claim.",
