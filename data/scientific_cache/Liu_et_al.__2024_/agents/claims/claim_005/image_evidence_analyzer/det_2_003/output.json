  "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table listing influenza virus strains (e.g., A/Michigan/45/2015 cell, A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 cell, B/Colorado/06/2017 cell, B/Phuket/3073/2013 cell), their amino acid substitutions at various positions, and footnotes indicating which candidate vaccine viruses were used in different influenza vaccines (RIV4, egg-based IIV4 such as Fluzone, Fluarix IIV4, and cell-based ccIIV4). The table only details the viral strains and amino acid substitutions used in various vaccine formulations (including RIV4/Flublok and egg\u2010based vaccines like Fluarix), but it does not present any data from a pivotal clinical trial comparing Flublok quadrivalent directly against Fluarix quadrivalent. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality limits visibility of the entire context, but no trial comparison data are visible.",
