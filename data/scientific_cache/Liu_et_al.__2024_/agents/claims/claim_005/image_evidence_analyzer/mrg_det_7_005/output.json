  "explanation": "A multi\u2010panel figure of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (log\u2082 scale) against four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Vic, B/Yam) measured at Day 0 and 1 month in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years), each tested against egg\u2010grown and cell\u2010grown virus. Box\u2010and\u2010whisker plots with overlaid individual data points are shown. Colored symbols indicate different vaccine sequences (generic codes: ccliIV4, RIV4, IIIV4) in a crossover design, with p-values denoting statistical comparisons. The figure shows immunogenicity data for generic vaccine codes (RIV4, IIIV4, ccliIV4) in a crossover design but does not explicitly identify Flublok (quadrivalent) or Fluarix (quadrivalent standard\u2010dose) by name, nor a pivotal head-to-head comparison between them, and thus does not support the claim Note: Legend text is small and generic codes are used; brand names are not visible",
