  "explanation": "Composite figure with multiple panels showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log\u2082 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination in Year 2 for four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM). Each panel plots geometric mean titers with 95% CI for seven vaccination sequence arms: ccliV4-ccliV4, ccliV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccliV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccliV4, IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-IIV4. P values indicate statistical comparisons between the IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm and other arms. does not support the claim because the figure shows Year 2 repeat\u2010vaccination arms comparing multiple vaccine sequences and does not present data from a pivotal trial directly comparing Flublok (RIV4) versus Fluarix (quadrivalent standard\u2010dose egg\u2010based IIV4). Note: The figure pertains to repeat vaccination in Year 2 and references IIV4 as Fluzone, not Fluarix; it does not explicitly address the pivotal trial comparison.",
