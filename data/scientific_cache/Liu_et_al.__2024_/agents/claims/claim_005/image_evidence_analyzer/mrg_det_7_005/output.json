  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Graphical figure with multiple panels showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (Log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination across two age cohorts (18\u201344 yrs and 45\u201364 yrs) and four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Each panel displays box-and-whisker plots for six color-coded vaccine sequence groups: ccIIV4\u2192ccIIV4, ccIIV4\u2192RIV4, RIV4\u2192ccIIV4, RIV4\u2192RIV4, IIV4\u2192ccIIV4, and IIV4\u2192IIV4. The figure compares RIV4 and IIV4 generically but does not name Flublok or Fluarix; therefore, it does not support the claim that Flublok was evaluated against Fluarix. Note: Figure uses generic vaccine codes without brand names; resolution may limit visibility of any caption text specifying brands.",
