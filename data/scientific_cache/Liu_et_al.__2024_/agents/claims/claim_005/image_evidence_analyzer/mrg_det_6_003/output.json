  "claim_id": "claim_005",
  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing geometric mean ratios of egg- versus cell-grown vaccine virus titers (panels A and B) and proportions of subjects with \u22654-fold reduction in titer (panels C and D) at pre- and 1-month post-vaccination for four quadrivalent vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). Data points and statistical comparisons are indicated for each vaccine strain (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM). Evidence: The figure legend and data panels include both Fluarix IIV4 (black circles) and RIV4 (orange circles) in the same pivotal immunogenicity study, directly comparing post-vaccination antibody responses between these vaccines. The figure supports the claim by presenting immunogenicity data from the same trial that directly compares Flublok (RIV4) with Fluarix IIV4, demonstrating evaluation of RIV4 against the standard-dose Fluarix vaccine. Note: The figure clearly shows a head-to-head comparison but does not explicitly label this study as the 'pivotal trial'; interpretation assumes this is the primary immunogenicity study for licensure.",
