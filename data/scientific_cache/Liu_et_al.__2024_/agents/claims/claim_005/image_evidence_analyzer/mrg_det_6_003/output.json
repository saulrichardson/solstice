  "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing immunogenicity comparisons in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Panels A and B display geometric mean ratios of egg-to-cell virus titers (with 95% CIs) for four vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell culture\u2013derived IIV4, and RIV4), across influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. Panels C and D show the proportion of \u22654-fold titer reduction to cell-based virus pre- and post-vaccination for the same vaccines and strains, with p-values annotated for RIV4 vs. Fluarix IIV4 in the A(H3N2) group. Evidence: The figure includes side-by-side immunogenicity data for RIV4 (the quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok) and Fluarix IIV4 (the quadrivalent standard-dose egg-based vaccine), with statistical comparisons (p-values) directly between these two vaccines. The figure directly compares RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) against Fluarix IIV4, demonstrating head-to-head evaluation; this supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine). Note: The figure does not explicitly label this as the 'pivotal trial,' but it clearly shows direct comparative data between RIV4 and Fluarix IIV4.",
