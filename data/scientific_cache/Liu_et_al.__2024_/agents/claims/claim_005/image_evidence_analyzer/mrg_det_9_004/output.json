  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing geometric mean ELISA antibody titers (Log2 scale) against egg-derived and cell-derived HA (panel A), HA ELISA titer ratios (panel B), and stalk domain titers and fold-rise (panels C and D) at Day 0 and 1 month after vaccination. Seven colored groups represent different prime-boost sequences labeled cclIV4-cclIV4, cclIV4-RIV4, RIV4-cclIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-cclIV4, IIV4-RIV4, and IIV4-IIV4. Evidence: The figure includes groups for RIV4-RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) and IIV4-IIV4 (inactivated quadrivalent vaccine) comparisons but does not explicitly name Fluarix. The image demonstrates that RIV4 (Flublok) was compared to a generic IIV4 comparator, but it does not explicitly identify the inactivated vaccine as Fluarix, so it does not support the claim that Flublok quadrivalent was evaluated against Fluarix quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine. Note: The figure legend uses abbreviations (IIV4) without brand names; interpretation relies solely on visible labels and may require full document context for confirmation.",
