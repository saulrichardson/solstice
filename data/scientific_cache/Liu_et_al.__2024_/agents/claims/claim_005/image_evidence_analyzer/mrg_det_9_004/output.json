  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multipart figure showing ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) to egg-derived and cell-derived HA antigens (panels A) and HA stalk antigens (panels C and D), as well as ELISA titer ratios (panel B), measured at Day 0 and 1 month post vaccination. Data are plotted for seven groups distinguished by colored symbols and labeled as ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, and IIV4-IIV4. The figure presents immunogenicity comparisons among vaccines labeled as ccIIV4, RIV4, and IIV4 but does not explicitly identify Flublok or Fluarix or indicate that RIV4 was compared directly against the standard-dose Fluarix in the pivotal trial, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The figure does not include brand names and the study context is not described; resolution limits visibility of full legend text.",
