  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Dot-and-error-bar plots showing geometric mean fold rise of antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and fold reduction of antibody titers at 6 months post-vaccination (panels C and D) for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Evidence: The figure includes RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent vaccine, i.e., Flublok) and Fluarix IIV4 arms compared directly in the same pivotal trial. The figure supports the claim because it shows RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) evaluated side-by-side with Fluarix IIV4, supports the claim",
