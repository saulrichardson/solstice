  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise (Day 0 to Month 1) and fold reduction (Month 1 to Month 6) in antibody titers for two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years) across eight influenza antigens. Data are plotted for four vaccines: Fluzone IIV4 (open circles), Fluarix IIV4 (solid black circles), ccIIV4 (solid green circles), and RIV4 (solid orange circles). P-values comparing vaccine groups are indicated above select comparisons. Evidence: RIV4 (orange circles) and Fluarix IIV4 (black circles) are shown side by side for each antigen with statistical comparisons (p-values) indicating direct head-to-head evaluation in the pivotal trial. supports the claim because the figure directly presents immunogenicity comparisons between RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) and Fluarix IIV4 (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) in the pivotal clinical study",
