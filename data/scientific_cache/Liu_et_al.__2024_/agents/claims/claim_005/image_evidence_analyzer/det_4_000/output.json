  "explanation": "Multi\u2010panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise in HAI antibody titers at 1 month and fold reduction at 6 months post\u2010vaccination, stratified by age group (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) for four quadrivalent vaccines: Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4. Evidence: The figure compares RIV4 (orange symbols) against Fluarix IIV4 (black symbols), but does not explicitly identify RIV4 as Flublok. The image shows a head\u2010to\u2010head comparison of RIV4 versus Fluarix IIV4, but because RIV4 is not labeled as Flublok, the figure does not support the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix in the pivotal trial. Note: It is not possible from the image alone to confirm that RIV4 corresponds to the brand name Flublok. No trial context or pivotal designation is provided.",
