  "explanation": "A table displaying demographic characteristics (mean age, age groups, sex, race, ethnicity), study site distribution, and influenza vaccination history for four cohorts with sample sizes n=122, n=120, n=283, and n=198. The table shows only baseline demographic and vaccination history data for four unnamed cohorts and does not identify any vaccine arms or indicate that Flublok (quadrivalent) was compared against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine), so it does not support the claim. Note: The column headers with vaccine group labels are not visible in the image, preventing linkage of cohorts to specific vaccines.",
