  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Table of demographic characteristics from a clinical trial showing four study arms: Fluzone IIV4 (n=122), Fluarix IIV4 (n=120), ccIIV4 (n=283), and RIV4 (n=198), with breakdowns by age, sex, race, site, and vaccination history. Evidence: Presence of both Fluarix IIV4 and RIV4 columns in the same pivotal trial table supports the claim because the table includes a Fluarix IIV4 arm and an RIV4 arm (representing Flublok quadrivalent), indicating they were evaluated against each other in the pivotal trial",
