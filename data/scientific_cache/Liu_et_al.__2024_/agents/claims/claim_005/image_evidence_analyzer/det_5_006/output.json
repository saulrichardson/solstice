  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel ELISA data figure showing geometric mean antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) across influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata antigens, plus head/stalk subdomain analyses and egg/cell HA titer ratios. Evidence: The figure explicitly lists Fluarix IIV4 and RIV4 (the recombinant quadrivalent vaccine, i.e., Flublok) as two of the four arms, indicating direct comparison of RIV4 versus Fluarix IIV4 in the trial data. supports the claim because the figure shows that RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) was evaluated alongside Fluarix IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine) in the same pivotal trial data. Note: The image uses the abbreviation RIV4 rather than the brand name Flublok; assuming RIV4 corresponds to Flublok QIV based on standard terminology.",
