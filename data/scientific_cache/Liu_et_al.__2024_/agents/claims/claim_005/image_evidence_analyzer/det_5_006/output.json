  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",

  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA titers (log2 scale) against egg-grown and cell-grown HA, egg/cell HA titer ratios, HA stalk titers, and fold-rise in HA stalk ELISA titers for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months. Evidence: The legend lists RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine, i.e., Flublok) alongside Fluarix IIV4, demonstrating they were evaluated head-to-head in the trial. The figure directly compares RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) with Fluarix IIV4, which supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
