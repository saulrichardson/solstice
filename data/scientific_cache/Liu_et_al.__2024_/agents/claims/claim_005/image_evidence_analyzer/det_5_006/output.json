  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Multi\u2010panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) against egg\u2010 and cell\u2010derived HA antigens of influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post\u2010vaccination. Four vaccine groups are compared in each panel: Fluzone IIV4 (black), Fluarix IIV4 (blue), ccIIV4 (green), and RIV4 (orange). Additional panels show egg/cell HA ELISA titer ratios and HA stalk\u2013specific ELISA titers and fold\u2010rise. Evidence: The figure directly compares the RIV4 group (recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine, i.e. Flublok) with the Fluarix IIV4 group (standard\u2010dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine). The inclusion of both the RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) and Fluarix IIV4 (quadrivalent standard\u2010dose) groups in head\u2010to\u2010head immunogenicity comparisons supports the claim. Note: The figure does not explicitly label this as the pivotal trial, but the direct comparison of RIV4 and Fluarix IIV4 in the presented data strongly implies it was part of the pivotal evaluation.",
