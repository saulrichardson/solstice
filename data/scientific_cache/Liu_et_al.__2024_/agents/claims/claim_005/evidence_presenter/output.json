This matches the factual content of the quote to verify, listing the randomized allocation of participants to Fluarix IIV4 (a quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) and RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent), with the same numbers and structure.. The quote directly supports the claim. It shows that in the pivotal trial, participants were randomized to receive Fluarix IIV4 (a quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) and RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent). The explicit mention of both vaccines and their allocation confirms that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) in the pivotal trial, as the claim asserts."

Evidence: The figure explicitly lists Fluarix IIV4 and RIV4 (the recombinant quadrivalent vaccine, i.e., Flublok) as two of the four arms, indicating direct comparison of RIV4 versus Fluarix IIV4 in the trial data. supports the claim because the figure shows that RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) was evaluated alongside Fluarix IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine) in the same pivotal trial data. Note: The image uses the abbreviation RIV4 rather than the brand name Flublok; assuming RIV4 corresponds to Flublok QIV based on standard terminology."

Data points and statistical comparisons are indicated for each vaccine strain (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM). Evidence: The figure legend and data panels include both Fluarix IIV4 (black circles) and RIV4 (orange circles) in the same pivotal immunogenicity study, directly comparing post-vaccination antibody responses between these vaccines. The figure supports the claim by presenting immunogenicity data from the same trial that directly compares Flublok (RIV4) with Fluarix IIV4, demonstrating evaluation of RIV4 against the standard-dose Fluarix vaccine. Note: The figure clearly shows a head-to-head comparison but does not explicitly label this study as the 'pivotal trial'; interpretation assumes this is the primary immunogenicity study for licensure."
