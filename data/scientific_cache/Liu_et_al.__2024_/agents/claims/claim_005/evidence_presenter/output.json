Year 1 (2018\u20132019) shows 723 participants randomized into four vaccine arms: cell\u2010culture quadrivalent influenza vaccine (ccIIV4, n=283), recombinant\u2010hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV4, n=198), Fluzone standard\u2010dose quadrivalent (Fluzone IIV4, n=122), and Fluarix standard\u2010dose quadrivalent (Fluarix IIV4, n=120). The diagram also details completion rates at 1 and 6 months and re\u2010enrollment in Year 2, with subsequent re\u2010randomization into various vaccine sequences. Evidence: Year 1 vaccine allocation includes an RIV4 arm (n=198) and a Fluarix IIV4 arm (n=120), indicating they were evaluated in the same pivotal trial. The diagram shows RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) and Fluarix IIV4 arms randomized and compared in the pivotal trial, which supports the claim. Note: RIV4 corresponds to the recombinant quadrivalent vaccine (Flublok) although the brand name is not explicitly shown in the figure."

Four vaccine groups are plotted at Day 0, Month 1, and Month 6: Fluzone IIV4 (black), Fluarix IIV4 (blue), ccIIV4 (green), and RIV4 (orange). Pairwise p-values comparing vaccine groups are annotated above the points. Evidence: The figure directly plots and statistically compares RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) versus Fluarix IIV4 (quadrivalent standard-dose) antibody responses across all strains and timepoints. The figure supports the claim by showing head-to-head immunogenicity comparisons between RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) and Fluarix IIV4 (standard-dose quadrivalent) in the pivotal trial context. Note: The figure does not explicitly label this as the pivotal trial, and full study design details are not visible, so attribution to the specific pivotal study is inferred but not spelled out."

Four vaccine groups are compared in each panel: Fluzone IIV4 (black), Fluarix IIV4 (blue), ccIIV4 (green), and RIV4 (orange). Additional panels show egg/cell HA ELISA titer ratios and HA stalk\u2013specific ELISA titers and fold\u2010rise. Evidence: The figure directly compares the RIV4 group (recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine, i.e. Flublok) with the Fluarix IIV4 group (standard\u2010dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine). The inclusion of both the RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) and Fluarix IIV4 (quadrivalent standard\u2010dose) groups in head\u2010to\u2010head immunogenicity comparisons supports the claim. Note: The figure does not explicitly label this as the pivotal trial, but the direct comparison of RIV4 and Fluarix IIV4 in the presented data strongly implies it was part of the pivotal evaluation."

Panels A and B display geometric mean ratios of egg-to-cell virus titers (with 95% CIs) for four vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell culture\u2013derived IIV4, and RIV4), across influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. Panels C and D show the proportion of \u22654-fold titer reduction to cell-based virus pre- and post-vaccination for the same vaccines and strains, with p-values annotated for RIV4 vs. Fluarix IIV4 in the A(H3N2) group. Evidence: The figure includes side-by-side immunogenicity data for RIV4 (the quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok) and Fluarix IIV4 (the quadrivalent standard-dose egg-based vaccine), with statistical comparisons (p-values) directly between these two vaccines. The figure directly compares RIV4 (Flublok quadrivalent) against Fluarix IIV4, demonstrating head-to-head evaluation; this supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine). Note: The figure does not explicitly label this as the 'pivotal trial,' but it clearly shows direct comparative data between RIV4 and Fluarix IIV4."
