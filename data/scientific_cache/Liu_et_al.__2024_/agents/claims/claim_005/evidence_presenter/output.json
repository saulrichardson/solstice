Evidence: Presence of RIV4 (orange) and Fluarix IIV4 (black) data points side by side across all comparisons, demonstrating that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4/Flublok) was evaluated directly against Fluarix IIV4 in the trial. The figure shows RIV4 (the recombinant quadrivalent vaccine, Flublok) directly compared with Fluarix IIV4 in immunogenicity endpoints, which supports the claim Note: The figure uses the abbreviation RIV4 rather than the brand name Flublok, but RIV4 corresponds to Flublok quadrivalent vaccine in context."
