The data compare four vaccine formulations: Fluzone IIV4 (egg-based standard-dose), Fluarix IIV4 (egg-based standard-dose), ccIIV4 (cell culture-based), and RIV4 (recombinant quadrivalent). Outcomes include geometric mean ratios of egg- to cell-grown virus titers (Panels A, B) and proportions achieving \u22654-fold reduced titers to cell-grown vaccine (Panels C, D) pre- and post-vaccination for the four influenza strains. Evidence: Presence of RIV4 (orange) and Fluarix IIV4 (black) data points side by side across all comparisons, demonstrating that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4/Flublok) was evaluated directly against Fluarix IIV4 in the trial. The figure shows RIV4 (the recombinant quadrivalent vaccine, Flublok) directly compared with Fluarix IIV4 in immunogenicity endpoints, which supports the claim Note: The figure uses the abbreviation RIV4 rather than the brand name Flublok, but RIV4 corresponds to Flublok quadrivalent vaccine in context.",
