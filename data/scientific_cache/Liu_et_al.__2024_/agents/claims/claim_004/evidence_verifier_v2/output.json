The meaning and technical content are identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (the higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to the cell-propagated A (H3 N2) virus than both ccIIV4 (cell-culture inactivated vaccine) and IIV4 (egg-based standard-dose vaccine) in year 1. This demonstrates that the higher-dose recombinant vaccine can induce a more robust antibody response than the standard-dose egg-based vaccine, as claimed.",
