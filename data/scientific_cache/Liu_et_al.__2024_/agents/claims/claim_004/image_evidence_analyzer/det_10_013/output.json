  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A table of demographic characteristics (age, age group, sex, race, site, vaccination history) across four study groups (n=122, 120, 283, 198) drawn from page 11 of a clinical document, alongside adjoining Methods text describing vaccine strains and immunogenicity assay approaches. The image contains only participant demographics and study methods, with no data on antibody responses or dose comparisons; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Table shows only baseline characteristics and prior vaccination history. No immunogenicity or antibody response data are visible.",
