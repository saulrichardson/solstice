  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing demographic characteristics and prior influenza vaccination history for four vaccine groups: Fluzone IIV4 (n=122), Fluarix IIV4 (n=120), ccIIV4 (n=283), and RIV4 (n=198). Variables include mean age, age groups, sex, race/ethnicity, study site distribution, and receipt of influenza vaccines in past seasons. The table presents baseline demographic and vaccination history data but contains no immunogenicity or antibody response measurements. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis is limited to the visible content; no antibody titer or immune response data are shown.",
