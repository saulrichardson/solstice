  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (Log2 scale) against egg- and cell-propagated HA antigens from A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Vic and B/Yam strains at Day 0, 1 month and 6 months post-vaccination (Panel A); geometric mean ratios of egg/cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month for different HA subtypes (Panel B); ELISA titers against H3 and H1 stalk domains over time (Panel C); and fold-rise in stalk ELISA titers at 1 month relative to Day 0 (Panel D). Four vaccine groups are shown: Fluzone IIV4 (egg-based standard dose), Fluarix IIV4 (egg-based standard dose), ccIIV4 (cell-based) and RIV4 (recombinant high-dose). Evidence: At 1 month post-vaccination, the recombinant RIV4 group (orange) exhibits higher ELISA titers against cell-propagated A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 HA (Panel A, right) and against H3 and H1 stalk antigens (Panels C and D) compared with the egg-based Fluzone and Fluarix IIV4 groups, with p-values indicating statistical significance. supports the claim because the recombinant high-dose vaccine (RIV4) induces greater binding antibody titers than the egg-based standard-dose vaccines in multiple antigen assays, demonstrating a more robust antibody response. Note: Data are limited to ELISA binding titers and may not reflect functional neutralization; image readability limits extraction of all exact values and full statistical context.",
