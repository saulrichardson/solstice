  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers to influenza HA antigens at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4). Panels include: A) ELISA titers for egg-grown and cell-grown HA of A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains; B) geometric mean ratios of egg- to cell-derived HA ELISA titers at 1 month; C) H3 and H1 stalk-binding antibody titers; D) fold-rise in stalk titers at 1 month versus baseline. Evidence: In Panel C, RIV4 (recombinant) elicits higher H3 and H1 stalk ELISA titers at 1 month versus Fluzone and Fluarix (p<0.05). In Panel D, RIV4 shows a greater fold-rise in stalk antibody titers at 1 month compared to egg-based vaccines. supports the claim because the recombinant RIV4 vaccine group exhibited statistically significant higher antibody titers and fold-rise in HA stalk responses at 1 month compared to egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: Data shown are serological titers with statistical comparisons; image quality allows clear assessment of p-values, but clinical efficacy is not addressed.",
