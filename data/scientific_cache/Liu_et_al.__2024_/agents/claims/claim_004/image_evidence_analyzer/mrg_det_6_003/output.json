  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multipanel figure (panels A\u2013D) showing in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years) the geometric mean ratios of antibody titers against egg-grown versus cell-grown influenza vaccine virus (panels A and B) and the proportion of participants with \u22654-fold change in that egg/cell titer ratio pre- to 1-month post-vaccination (panels C and D). Four vaccine groups are compared: two egg-based standard-dose inactivated vaccines (Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4), a cell-based quadrivalent vaccine (ccIIV4), and a recombinant quadrivalent vaccine (RIV4). The figure focuses on differences in the ratio of egg-adapted versus cell-based virus neutralization titers rather than comparing the absolute magnitude of antibody responses. It does not show that the recombinant (RIV4) induces a more robust antibody response compared to the standard-dose egg-based vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clear in presenting geometric mean ratios and fold-change proportions but does not include absolute titer comparisons; conclusions about overall antibody robustness cannot be drawn from these data.",
