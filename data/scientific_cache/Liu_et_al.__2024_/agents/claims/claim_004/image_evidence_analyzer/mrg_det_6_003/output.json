  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Figure with four panels (A\u2013D) showing immune response metrics to four influenza vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) in adults aged 18\u201344 years (panels A and C) and 45\u201364 years (panels B and D). Panels A and B plot the geometric mean ratio of egg-grown to cell-grown virus hemagglutination inhibition titers (95% CI) for each vaccine and strain (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM). Panels C and D show the proportion of subjects with \u22654-fold lower titers to cell-grown virus pre- and post-vaccination for the same vaccines and strains. Statistical annotations highlight significant differences for the A(H3N2) strain. Evidence: Panel A shows that RIV4 (recombinant vaccine) has a significantly lower egg-to-cell titer ratio for A(H3N2) compared to Fluzone (p=0.0014), Fluarix (p=0.0021), and ccIIV4 (p=0.03) in 18\u201344 year olds. Panel C shows a lower proportion of \u22654-fold reduced titer to cell vaccine virus post-vaccination for A(H3N2) with RIV4 (26%) versus Fluzone (58%), p=0.0001. Similar significant findings are shown in panels B and D for 45\u201364 year olds. The figure supports the claim by demonstrating that the higher-dose recombinant vaccine (RIV4) elicited a more favorable antibody response against cell-grown (wild-type) H3N2 virus compared with egg-based standard-dose vaccines, as evidenced by lower geometric mean egg-to-cell titer ratios and fewer \u22654-fold reduced titers (supports the claim). Note: Findings are limited to the A(H3N2) strain and relative ratios; absolute hemagglutination inhibition titers for each vaccine are not shown, and results may not generalize to other strains or broader clinical efficacy.",
