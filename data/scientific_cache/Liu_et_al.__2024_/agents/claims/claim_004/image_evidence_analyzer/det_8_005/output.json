  "claim_id": "claim_004",
  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-panel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay results pre- and post-vaccination for two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years) against four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Panel A plots the fold-reduction in HI titer to cell-grown vaccine virus, and Panel B shows the proportion of subjects with a \u22654-fold reduced HI titer to cell-grown vaccine virus. Different symbols and colors denote seven vaccination sequences involving cell-based quadrivalent (ccIIV4), recombinant (RIV4), and egg-based quadrivalent (IIV4, including Fluzone) vaccines over two seasons. The figure does not provide a direct comparison of post-vaccination antibody titers elicited by a higher-dose recombinant vaccine versus egg-based standard-dose vaccines. It instead depicts fold-reductions in HI titers against cell-grown viruses across mixed vaccine sequences, so it does not support the claim. Note: Interpretation limited by the figure focusing on fold-reduction metrics rather than absolute antibody titers, mixed vaccination sequences, and lack of clear labeling of vaccine dose levels.",
