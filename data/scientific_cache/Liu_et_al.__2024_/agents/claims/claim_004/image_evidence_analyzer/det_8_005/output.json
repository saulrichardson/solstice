  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Figure showing the proportion of subjects with \u22654-fold reduced hemagglutination inhibition titers to cell-propagated vaccine viruses (egg/cell) measured pre- and post-vaccination across four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Multiple vaccination regimens are compared, including cell-based inactivated quadrivalent (ccIIV4), recombinant quadrivalent (RIV4), standard egg-based inactivated quadrivalent (IIV4), and various sequential combinations. does not support the claim because the figure presents proportions of reduced HI titers across different vaccine platforms but does not compare a higher-dose recombinant vaccine with egg-based standard-dose vaccines to show a more robust antibody response. Note: The image is clear regarding vaccine platforms and fold-reduction measures, but no dosing information or direct high-dose versus standard-dose comparison is provided.",
