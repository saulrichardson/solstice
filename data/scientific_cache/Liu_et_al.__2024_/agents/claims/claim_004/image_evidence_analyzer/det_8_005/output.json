  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Scatter plots showing the proportion of participants with a \u22654-fold reduced hemagglutination inhibition titer to cell-grown vaccine virus versus egg-grown virus before (Pre) and one month after (Post) vaccination for four influenza components (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM). Data are shown for seven Year 2 repeat vaccination arms (various sequences of cell-based (ccIIV4), recombinant (RIV4), and egg-based standard-dose (IIV4/Fluzone IIV4) vaccines) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years), with p-values marking statistically significant pre- versus post-vaccination trends. The figure presents proportions of participants with altered egg/cell virus titer ratios rather than absolute antibody titers. It does not compare the magnitude of antibody responses between higher-dose recombinant and egg-based standard-dose vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited by the figure\u2019s focus on egg/cell HI titer ratios rather than overall antibody GMTs; small text and axis labels reduce clarity of the vaccine-specific comparisons.",
