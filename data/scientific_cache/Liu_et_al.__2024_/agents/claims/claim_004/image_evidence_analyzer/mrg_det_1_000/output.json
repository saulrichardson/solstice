  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-year CONSORT flow diagram detailing participant enrollment, randomization, vaccine allocation, and follow-up visits. Year 1 (2018\u20132019) shows four vaccine arms (cell-culture IIV4, recombinant-hemagglutinin vaccine RIV4, egg-based standard-dose Fluzone IIV4, and Fluarix IIV4) with age strata and numbers completing day 0, 1 month, and 6 month visits. Year 2 (2019\u20132020) shows re-enrollment of Year 1 participants, re-randomization into various vaccine sequences, exclusions, and final group sizes. The figure only presents participant flow and allocation; it does not include any antibody response or immunogenicity data and therefore does not support the claim Note: The diagram is clear and complete for enrollment data, but no immunologic measurements are shown",
