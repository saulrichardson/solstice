  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram showing enrollment and randomization of participants over two influenza seasons (2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020). It details the numbers allocated to four vaccine groups in Year 1 (cell-culture quadrivalent, recombinant quadrivalent, and two egg-based standard-dose quadrivalents), numbers completing visits, re-enrollment and re-randomization in Year 2, exclusions, and final group sizes. The figure is a CONSORT diagram of participant allocation and follow-up without any immunogenicity or antibody response data; it does not support the claim. Note: The figure only presents enrollment and randomization details; no serologic or antibody response outcomes are shown.",
