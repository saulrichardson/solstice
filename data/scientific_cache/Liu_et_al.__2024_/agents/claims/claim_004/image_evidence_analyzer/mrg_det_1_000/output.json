  "explanation": "CONSORT flow diagram showing Year 1 (2018\u20132019) and Year 2 (2019\u20132020) participants re\u2010enrolled and randomized into three vaccine groups: IIV4 (egg\u2010based standard\u2010dose inactivated influenza), ccIIV4 (cell\u2010culture based inactivated influenza), and RIV4 (recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine). It shows numbers randomized, re\u2010randomized, and excluded per protocol criteria. The figure is a participant flow diagram and does not present any antibody titer or immunogenicity data comparing RIV4 to egg\u2010based IIV4, so it does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity results are shown; only enrollment and randomization numbers are presented.",
