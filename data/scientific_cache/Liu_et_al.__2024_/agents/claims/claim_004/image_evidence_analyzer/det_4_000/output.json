  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Scatter plots showing geometric mean fold rise in antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and geometric mean fold reduction from 1 to 6 months post-vaccination (panels C and D) for four vaccines (egg-based Fluzone IIV4, egg-based Fluarix IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) across influenza strains (H3N2 egg, H3N2 cell, H1N1 egg, H1N1 cell, B/Victoria egg, B/Victoria cell, B/Yamagata egg, B/Yamagata cell) in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). P-values comparing RIV4 to egg-based vaccines are annotated above selected strain comparisons. Evidence: In both age groups, at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B), RIV4 (orange) elicited significantly higher geometric mean fold rises in antibody titers than egg-based Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4 for H3N2 egg (p<0.0001), H3N2 cell (p<0.0001), H1N1 cell (p=0.021), and additional strains. The data show that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) induced significantly greater 1-month antibody fold rises compared with egg-based standard-dose vaccines across multiple influenza strains, which supports the claim Note: Image resolution limits precise reading of sample sizes and some p-values; data are limited to ages 18\u201364 and specific strains; fold reduction data at 6 months are not directly relevant to the initial antibody response claim.",
