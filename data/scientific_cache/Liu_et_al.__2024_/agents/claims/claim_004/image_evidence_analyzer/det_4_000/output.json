  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A four\u2010panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise in antibody titers at 1 month post\u2010vaccination (panels A and B) and geometric mean fold reduction at 6 months post\u2010vaccination (panels C and D) for two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). The figure compares four vaccines: Fluzone IIV4 (egg-based, open circles), Fluarix IIV4 (egg-based, black circles), ccIIV4 (cell-based, green), and RIV4 (recombinant, orange) across six influenza antigens (H3N2 egg, H3N2 cell, H1N1 egg, H1N1 cell, B/VIC egg/cell, B/YAM egg/cell), with p-values indicating statistical differences between groups. Evidence: At 1 month post\u2010vaccination, RIV4 (recombinant) shows higher geometric mean fold rises than the egg-based Fluzone and Fluarix for multiple antigens (e.g., H3N2 cell: ~3.3 vs ~1.1\u20131.5, p<0.0001; H1N1 egg: ~2.1 vs ~1.6\u20131.8, p=0.021; B/VIC egg: ~2.0 vs ~1.5\u20131.7, p=0.017; B/YAM egg: ~2.1 vs ~1.4\u20131.6, p=0.024), and at 6 months shows less waning for some strains (e.g., H3N2 cell and H1N1 cell with p=0.015\u20130.03). The data show that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) elicits significantly higher antibody fold rises at 1 month and reduced waning at 6 months compared with egg-based standard-dose vaccines, which supports the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: The figure provides immunogenicity data but does not display clinical efficacy or exact antigen doses. Some strain labels and p-values are small and may be hard to read in the image.",
