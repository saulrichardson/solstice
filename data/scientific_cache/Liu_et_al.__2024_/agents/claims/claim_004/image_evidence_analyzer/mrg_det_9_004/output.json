  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) measured at day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination in seven repeat vaccination arms. The arms represent different prime-boost combinations of cell-culture quadrivalent flu vaccine (ccIIV4), recombinant quadrivalent flu vaccine (RIV4), and egg-based inactivated quadrivalent flu vaccine (IIV4). Panels include head binding titers for H3N2, pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains (A), ratios of egg- versus cell-produced hemagglutinin ELISA titers (B), stalk binding titers for H3 and H1 (C), and fold-rise of stalk titers (1\u2009month/day\u20090) (D). Statistical comparisons are shown among the mixed vaccine arms. The figure does not support the claim because it does not directly compare a higher-dose recombinant vaccine to an egg-based standard-dose vaccine, and dose levels are not specified. There is no direct evidence of a more robust antibody response attributable to higher-dose recombinant vaccination over egg-based vaccination. Note: Dose information and direct head-to-head statistical comparison between recombinant and egg-based standard-dose vaccines are not provided in the figure.",
