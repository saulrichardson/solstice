  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) against egg-derived HA (left) and cell-derived HA (right) for influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination across seven immunization sequences (cell-based IIV4, recombinant RIV4, and egg-based IIV4 prime and boost permutations). Panel B shows geometric mean ratios of egg versus cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month. Panel C shows stalk-specific ELISA titers for H3 and H1 stalk antigens at Day 0 and 1 month. Panel D shows geometric mean fold-rise in stalk ELISA titers from Day 0 to 1 month. does not support the claim because the figure does not present a direct comparison of antibody responses between higher-dose recombinant vaccine and egg-based standard-dose vaccine, and no significant superiority of RIV4 over IIV4 on relevant HA endpoints is shown. Note: Limited by absence of clear annotations comparing RIV4 versus IIV4 groups and by resolution of p-value labels; detailed statistical comparisons for recombinant versus egg-based vaccines are not presented.",
