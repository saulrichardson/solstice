  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (log\u2082 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Panels are stratified by age group (18\u201344 yrs and 45\u201364 yrs) and virus source (egg-grown vs cell-grown). Within each panel, boxplots represent six vaccine\u2010sequence groups denoted by color codes (prior season vaccine/current season vaccine: egg-based IIV4, cell-culture ccIIV4, or recombinant RIV4). Statistically significant differences between groups at 1 month are annotated with p-values. Evidence: In the 18\u201344 yrs cell-virus A(H3N2) panel at 1 month, groups receiving recombinant vaccine (RIV4) show significantly higher HI titers than the egg-based IIV4 groups (e.g., p<0.0001, p=0.013, p=0.001, p=0.011). Similar significant increases for RIV4 arms versus IIV4 arms are noted for other strains and age categories. The figure shows vaccine arms that include recombinant RIV4 producing higher antibody titers than egg-based IIV4 at 1 month, with multiple p-values <0.05, which supports the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine induces a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: Group labels reflect prior/current season combinations; exact numeric titers are not labeled; visual resolution limits precise reading of all p-values and magnitudes; findings pertain to HI titers, not clinical endpoints.",
