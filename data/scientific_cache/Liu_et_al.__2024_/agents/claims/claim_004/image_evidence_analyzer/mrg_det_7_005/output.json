  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Panel of four rows corresponding to influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. Within each row are four subplots showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post\u2013year-2 vaccination against both egg-propagated and cell-propagated vaccine viruses. Box plots display geometric mean titers (GMTs) with 95% CIs for seven repeat vaccination arms (cclIV4-cclIV4, cclIV4-RIV4, RIV4-cclIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-cclIV4, IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-IIV4), and horizontal bars indicate statistically significant differences with p-values. Evidence: RIV4-RIV4 arm showed significantly higher post-vaccination GMTs compared with IIV4-IIV4 (egg-based) for cell-propagated A(H3N2) (p=0.015) and other strains (e.g., B/Yamagata p<0.0001). The figure shows that two consecutive doses of recombinant vaccine (RIV4-RIV4) induced higher HI antibody titers than two doses of egg-based standard vaccine (IIV4-IIV4), supporting the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: Only HAI titers are shown; clinical efficacy is not assessed. Dosing details are not explicit in the figure. Some text and labels are small and partially obscured.",
