  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial page from a clinical research article describing repeat influenza vaccination, listing vaccine types (egg-based IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4), sample size (N=723), and mentioning an exploratory analysis of A(H3N2) immunogenicity (HA head binding) among different repeat vaccination groups. The image does not support the claim because it does not present clear comparative data showing that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine induces a more robust antibody response than an egg-based standard-dose vaccine. Note: Text is truncated and partially unreadable, limiting the ability to extract detailed immunogenicity results or dose information.",
