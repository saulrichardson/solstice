  "claim_id": "claim_004",
  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Multipanel figure showing antibody responses (MN titers for A(H3N2) and HI titers for H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) on a log\u2082 scale at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post\u2010vaccination in four groups: Fluzone IIV4 (egg\u2010based), Fluarix IIV4 (egg\u2010based), ccIIV4 (cell\u2010based), and RIV4 (recombinant). Gray dots represent individual titers; colored symbols and error bars show geometric mean titers (GMTs) with 95% CI. Horizontal bars with p values from Tukey\u2019s multiple\u2010comparison tests indicate significant differences between vaccine groups at each time point. Evidence: At 1 month post\u2010vaccination, RIV4 (recombinant) shows significantly higher GMTs compared with egg\u2010based Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4 for A(H3N2) (p<0.0001) and H1N1pdm09 (p=0.003\u20130.015), as well as for B/Victoria and B/Yamagata strains (p=0.009\u20130.035). The figure supports the claim by directly showing that the higher\u2010dose recombinant vaccine (RIV4) induced significantly more robust antibody responses than the egg\u2010based standard\u2010dose vaccines at peak (1 month) and sustained (6 month) time points for multiple influenza strains. Note: Some text and p\u2010value annotations are small, but group differences and significance indicators are clear.",
