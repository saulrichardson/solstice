  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A multi\u2010panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) against A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains in two age cohorts (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years), measured against both egg\u2010propagated and cell\u2010propagated viruses at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post\u2010vaccination. Four vaccine groups are compared: Fluzone IIV4 (egg\u2010based standard\u2010dose, black), Fluarix IIV4 (egg\u2010based standard\u2010dose, blue), ccIIV4 (cell\u2010based, green), and RIV4 (higher\u2010dose recombinant, orange). Evidence: At 1 month post\u2010vaccination, RIV4 (orange) consistently shows higher GMTs against A(H3N2) than Fluzone IIV4 (black) with statistically significant p\u2010values (e.g., p=0.0008 and p<0.0001 in the 18\u201344 year egg\u2010virus panel; p<0.0001 in the 45\u201364 year cell\u2010virus panel). The data show that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) induces higher antibody titers than the standard\u2010dose egg\u2010based vaccine with significant p\u2010values, which supports the claim that a higher\u2010dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg\u2010based standard\u2010dose vaccines. Note: Comparisons are strongest for A(H3N2); responses to other strains are variable. The figure does not show absolute GMT values or clinical endpoints.",
