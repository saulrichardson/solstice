  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Figure with sixteen scatter-and-bar panels showing antibody titers (MN or HI titers on a log2 scale) against four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) measured at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination. Panels are stratified by age group (18\u201344 years, 45\u201364 years) and by virus isolate origin (egg-grown vs cell-grown). Four vaccine groups are compared: two egg-based standard-dose IIV4s (Fluzone, Fluarix), a cell-culture IIV4, and a recombinant vaccine (RIV4). P-values are annotated above comparisons indicating statistical differences in titers between RIV4 and the egg-based vaccines. Evidence: Numerous significant p-values (e.g., <0.0001, 0.003, 0.045) show that RIV4 (orange) elicits higher microneutralization titers than egg-based IIV4s at 1 and 6 months for A(H3N2) across both age groups and virus origins, as well as significant higher HI titers for A(H1N1)pdm09 and some B strains. The figure supports the claim because the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) induced significantly higher antibody responses than the egg-based standard-dose vaccines across multiple strains, age groups, and time points, demonstrating a more robust immune response. Note: While the data clearly show higher titers for RIV4 in most comparisons, the figure does not indicate actual vaccine dose levels, and some strains (e.g., B/Victoria) show no significant differences. Interpretation is limited to the visible comparisons and p-values.",
