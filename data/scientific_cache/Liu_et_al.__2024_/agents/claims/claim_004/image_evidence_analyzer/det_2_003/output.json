  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-row table listing amino acid differences on the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) head domain for various vaccine seed viruses (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) comparing cell-derived versus egg-derived strains over two seasons (Year 1 and Year 2). Columns show specific HA positions and the corresponding residues in each virus strain and production method. The table presents sequence differences between cell-grown and egg-grown vaccine viruses but provides no data on vaccine dosing, recombinant versus standard formulations, or antibody responses, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The information is limited to antigenic sequence changes; no immunogenicity or dose-response data are included.",
