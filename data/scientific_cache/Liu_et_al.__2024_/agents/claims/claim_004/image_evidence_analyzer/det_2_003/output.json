  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine virus strains (cell-derived and egg-derived) and their amino acid substitutions at specific hemagglutinin positions, including notes on glycosylation motif losses, across different influenza lineages and seasons. does not support the claim because the table only details amino acid substitutions in vaccine seed strains and provides no data on antibody responses, vaccine dose, or comparative immunogenicity of recombinant versus egg-based vaccines.",
