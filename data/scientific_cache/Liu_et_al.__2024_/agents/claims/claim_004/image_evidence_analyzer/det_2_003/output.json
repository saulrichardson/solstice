  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-row table listing amino acid differences at specific HA head domain positions for various influenza vaccine viruses (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, B/Yamagata), comparing cell-derived, egg-derived, and egg CVV candidate vaccine viruses over two years. The table only presents amino acid sequence differences between cell- and egg-derived vaccine strains and does not provide any immunogenicity or antibody response data; it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible but contains only sequence data without any clinical or immunogenicity outcomes.",
