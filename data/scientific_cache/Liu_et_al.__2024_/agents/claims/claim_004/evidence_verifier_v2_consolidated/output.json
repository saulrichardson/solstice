Evidence: Numerous significant p-values (e.g., <0.0001, 0.003, 0.045) show that RIV4 (orange) elicits higher microneutralization titers than egg-based IIV4s at 1 and 6 months for A(H3N2) across both age groups and virus origins, as well as significant higher HI titers for A(H1N1)pdm09 and some B strains.

Columns are age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) tested against egg-grown virus and cell-grown virus; each plot shows baseline (Day 0) and 1-month post-vaccination titers for six vaccine sequences combining cell-based quadrivalent (ccIIV4), recombinant HA (RIV4), and egg-based standard-dose (IIV4) vaccines. Evidence: At 1 month, groups receiving two doses of the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4\u2013RIV4) show higher geometric mean HI titers than those receiving two doses of egg-based IIV4, with multiple statistically significant comparisons (e.g., p<0.0001, p=0.007, p=0.0002) favoring recombinant over egg-based vaccine. The figure shows that recombinant HA vaccination induces significantly higher antibody titers than egg-based standard-dose vaccination in multiple age groups and strains, which supports the claim Note: Resolution limits prevented reading every group label, and data are limited to HI titers at 1 month post-vaccination in 18\u201364 year-olds and may not generalize to all populations or long-term responses.",

      "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (Log\u2082 scale) to egg- and cell-derived HA antigens (panel A), egg/cell HA titer ratios (panel B), head-stalk HA titers (panel C), and HA stalk fold-rise (panel D) measured at baseline (Day 0) and one month after vaccination in seven study arms defined by vaccine type combinations (cell-based standard dose ccIIV4, egg-based standard dose IIV4, and recombinant RIV4). Each data point represents geometric mean titers with 95% confidence intervals; significant p-values are annotated for pairwise comparisons at one month. Evidence: In panel A (Cell virus HA at 1 month), the RIV4\u2013RIV4 group (orange) shows higher ELISA titers than the ccIIV4\u2013ccIIV4 (black) and IIV4\u2013IIV4 (red) groups, with statistically significant differences (e.g. p = 0.039 for H3N2, p = 0.005 and p = 0.0002 for B/Victoria, p = 0.014 and p = 0.007 for B/Yamagata). The higher post-vaccination HA antibody titers in the recombinant RIV4 groups compared to egg-based standard-dose IIV4 groups, with multiple statistically significant p-values, supports the claim. Note: Group labels are abbreviated and the figure is complex; exact vaccine dose information is inferred from labels rather than explicitly stated. ELISA titers are surrogate measures of antibody response, not direct neutralization assays.",
