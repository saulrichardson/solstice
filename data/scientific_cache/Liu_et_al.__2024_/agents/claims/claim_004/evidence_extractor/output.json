For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody response, it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4 A, Fig. S1 A).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote specifies that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) is a higher-dose vaccine and that it led to a significant increase in both the quality and quantity of antibody responses compared to standard-dose vaccines, directly supporting the claim."

      "quote": "In this randomized trial (Clinical trials gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg based (IIV4), cell culture based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines were compared. RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote describes the design of the study and the finding that RIV4, the higher-dose recombinant vaccine, induced higher antibody responses than the standard-dose egg-based vaccine, providing direct evidence for the claim."
