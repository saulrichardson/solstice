      "quote": "In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.",
      "explanation": "The quote 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.' appears in the document, specifically in the first page of the provided text. The wording and factual content are preserved, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'cell- A (H3 N2) virus' instead of 'cell-A (H3 N2) virus'). The meaning and technical content are identical.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that RIV4 (the higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine) induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to the cell-propagated A (H3 N2) virus than both ccIIV4 (cell-culture inactivated vaccine) and IIV4 (egg-based standard-dose vaccine) in year 1. This demonstrates that the higher-dose recombinant vaccine can induce a more robust antibody response than the standard-dose egg-based vaccine, as claimed."

      "quote": "RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody response in both 18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years, it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4 A, Fig. S1 A).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 9 of the document, though it is split by a line break and some intervening text. The relevant passage is: 'RIV4 contains 3 times the i d 45 HA/d / ...d IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain). For A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody ... years, it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4 A, Fig. S1 A).' The numbers and technical content match the quote to verify, and the meaning is preserved.. The quote explicitly states that RIV4 (the recombinant vaccine) contains 3 times the amount of HA per dose per strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (the standard-dose, egg-based and cell-based vaccines). It further states that, for A (H3 N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody response but also significantly increased the quantity of total A (H3 N2) cell HA head binding antibodies. This directly supports the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV4) may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines."

      "quote": "The RIV4 group had the highest A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk and A (H3 N2) HA stalk antibodies at 1 month post vaccination, however the fold rises of HA stalk antibodies were low (<1.8) and similar among all 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 4 D).",
      "explanation": "The quote appears on page 5 of the document: 'The RIV4 group had the highest A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk and A (H3 N2) HA stalk antibodies at 1 month post vaccination, however the fold rises of HA stalk antibodies were low (<1.8) and similar among all 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 4 D).' The wording and factual content match the quote to verify.. The quote directly states that the RIV4 group had the highest levels of A (H1 N1) pdm09 HA stalk and A (H3 N2) HA stalk antibodies at 1 month post vaccination, which supports the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine (RIV4) may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Although the fold rise was similar among groups, the absolute antibody levels were highest in the RIV4 group, which is relevant to the claim about a more robust response."

      "explanation": "Multipanel figure showing antibody responses (MN titers for A(H3N2) and HI titers for H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) on a log\u2082 scale at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post\u2010vaccination in four groups: Fluzone IIV4 (egg\u2010based), Fluarix IIV4 (egg\u2010based), ccIIV4 (cell\u2010based), and RIV4 (recombinant). Gray dots represent individual titers; colored symbols and error bars show geometric mean titers (GMTs) with 95% CI. Horizontal bars with p values from Tukey\u2019s multiple\u2010comparison tests indicate significant differences between vaccine groups at each time point. Evidence: At 1 month post\u2010vaccination, RIV4 (recombinant) shows significantly higher GMTs compared with egg\u2010based Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4 for A(H3N2) (p<0.0001) and H1N1pdm09 (p=0.003\u20130.015), as well as for B/Victoria and B/Yamagata strains (p=0.009\u20130.035). The figure supports the claim by directly showing that the higher\u2010dose recombinant vaccine (RIV4) induced significantly more robust antibody responses than the egg\u2010based standard\u2010dose vaccines at peak (1 month) and sustained (6 month) time points for multiple influenza strains. Note: Some text and p\u2010value annotations are small, but group differences and significance indicators are clear."

      "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold-rise of microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody titers at 1-month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and geometric mean fold-reduction of antibody titers at 6-months post-vaccination (panels C and D) for adults aged 18\u201344 years (A, C) and 45\u201364 years (B, D). Four vaccine groups are compared for each influenza virus strain/propagation method (egg- or cell-propagated H3N2, H1N1, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata): Fluzone IIV4 (egg-based standard-dose), Fluarix IIV4 (egg-based standard-dose), ccIIV4 (cell-based), and RIV4 (recombinant high-dose). Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals and p-values from Tukey\u2019s test indicate significant differences between RIV4 and egg-based vaccines. Evidence: In panels A and B, RIV4 (recombinant vaccine) consistently shows higher geometric mean fold-rise in antibody titers at 1 month compared with Fluzone IIV4 (egg-based), with p-values <0.05 across H3N2 egg, H3N2 cell, H1N1 egg, H1N1 cell, B/Victoria egg, B/Victoria cell, B/Yamagata egg, and B/Yamagata cell in both age groups. The figure shows that RIV4 induced significantly larger antibody responses at 1 month post-vaccination than the egg-based standard-dose Fluzone IIV4 across multiple strains and age groups, which supports the claim. Note: None"

      "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers to influenza HA antigens at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4). Panels include: A) ELISA titers for egg-grown and cell-grown HA of A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains; B) geometric mean ratios of egg- to cell-derived HA ELISA titers at 1 month; C) H3 and H1 stalk-binding antibody titers; D) fold-rise in stalk titers at 1 month versus baseline. Evidence: In Panel C, RIV4 (recombinant) elicits higher H3 and H1 stalk ELISA titers at 1 month versus Fluzone and Fluarix (p<0.05). In Panel D, RIV4 shows a greater fold-rise in stalk antibody titers at 1 month compared to egg-based vaccines. supports the claim because the recombinant RIV4 vaccine group exhibited statistically significant higher antibody titers and fold-rise in HA stalk responses at 1 month compared to egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: Data shown are serological titers with statistical comparisons; image quality allows clear assessment of p-values, but clinical efficacy is not addressed."

      "explanation": "Panel of four rows corresponding to influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. Within each row are four subplots showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post\u2013year-2 vaccination against both egg-propagated and cell-propagated vaccine viruses. Box plots display geometric mean titers (GMTs) with 95% CIs for seven repeat vaccination arms (cclIV4-cclIV4, cclIV4-RIV4, RIV4-cclIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-cclIV4, IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-IIV4), and horizontal bars indicate statistically significant differences with p-values. Evidence: RIV4-RIV4 arm showed significantly higher post-vaccination GMTs compared with IIV4-IIV4 (egg-based) for cell-propagated A(H3N2) (p=0.015) and other strains (e.g., B/Yamagata p<0.0001). The figure shows that two consecutive doses of recombinant vaccine (RIV4-RIV4) induced higher HI antibody titers than two doses of egg-based standard vaccine (IIV4-IIV4), supporting the claim that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: Only HAI titers are shown; clinical efficacy is not assessed. Dosing details are not explicit in the figure. Some text and labels are small and partially obscured."
