  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "document": "Liu_et_al.__2024_",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {
      "quote": "a cell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain).",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4), which is the first part of the claim. The document also discusses immunogenicity comparisons between these vaccines, supporting the link between higher HA content and greater immunogenicity. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated."
    },
    {
      "quote": "In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the second part of the claim: that Flublok (RIV4) resulted in greater immunogenicity (higher neutralizing and HA head binding antibodies) compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4). The document also explicitly states that RIV4 contains 3 times the HA antigen content of IIV4 and ccIIV4, which supports the first part of the claim. Therefore, the quote, in the context of the document, genuinely supports the claim as stated."
    },
    {
      "quote": "For A (H3N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody response in both age groups, it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A (H3N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4A, Fig. S1A).",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that RIV4 (Flublok) vaccination improved both the quality and quantity of antibody responses to A (H3N2) compared to other vaccines. Earlier in the document, it is specified that RIV4 contains 3 times the HA antigen content of standard-dose vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4). Therefore, the quote provides explicit evidence that the higher HA content in Flublok (RIV4) is linked to greater immunogenicity, supporting the claim."

    {
      "quote": "In this randomized trial (Clinical trials gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post vaccination with quad rival ent in activated egg based (IIV4), cell culture based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines were compared. RIV4 contains 45 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain, which is 3 times the amount in IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain).",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok (RIV4) contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4). The document also discusses immunogenicity comparisons between these vaccines, which is relevant to the second part of the claim, though the quote itself does not directly link the higher HA content to greater immunogenicity. However, the explicit antigen content comparison is present and accurate."

      "quote": "In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the second part of the claim: that Flublok (RIV4) is associated with greater immunogenicity compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4). It states that RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell-A (H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4, which are standard-dose vaccines. However, the quote does not address the first part of the claim regarding the 3x HA antigen content in Flublok. Therefore, it only supports the immunogenicity aspect of the claim, not the antigen content."
