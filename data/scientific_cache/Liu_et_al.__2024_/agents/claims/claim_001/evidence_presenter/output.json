  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "document": "Liu_et_al.__2024_",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {
      "quote": "a cell culture based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain).",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok (RIV4) contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4), which supports the first part of the claim. The document also discusses immunogenicity comparisons between these vaccines, with RIV4 (Flublok) showing higher antibody responses in some cases, supporting the link to greater immunogenicity. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated."

    {
      "quote": "In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the second part of the claim by stating that RIV4 (Flublok) induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies (i.e., greater immunogenicity) to cell-based A (H3N2) virus compared to standard-dose vaccines (ccIIV4 and IIV4). The document also explicitly states elsewhere that 'RIV4 contains 3 times the...HA/d...' compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4, supporting the first part of the claim about antigen content. Thus, the quote, in the context of the document, genuinely supports the claim."

RIV4 contains 3 times the intended 45 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 \u00b5g HA/dose/strain).",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per strain compared to standard-dose flu vaccines (IIV4 and ccIIV4). The second part of the claim, regarding greater immunogenicity, is also supported elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A (H3 N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4'), but the quote itself is focused on the antigen content. Thus, the quote genuinely supports the claim as stated."
