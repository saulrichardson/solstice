  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers against egg-derived and cell-derived HA for influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, and B/YAM at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4), plus panels of egg/cell HA ELISA titer ratios, HA stalk ELISA titers, and HA stalk ELISA titer fold-rise. The figure presents comparative immunogenicity data but does not include any information on HA antigen content or state that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image is legible for immunogenicity data but antigen dosage details are not provided.",
