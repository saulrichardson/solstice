  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi\u2010panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers against egg\u2010derived and cell\u2010derived HA (A), Egg/Cell HA ELISA titer ratios (B), HA stalk ELISA titers (C), and HA stalk titer fold\u2010rise (D) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post\u2010vaccination for four vaccine groups: Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4. Evidence: The figure presents immunogenicity data (antibody titers and fold\u2010rise) for RIV4 (recombinant vaccine) versus standard IIV4 vaccines but does not show HA antigen content or any 3\u00d7 dosing information. The figure shows greater immunogenicity for RIV4 versus standard\u2010dose vaccines but does not provide any data on HA antigen content or a 3\u00d7 dosage comparison; therefore, it does not support the claim Note: The image text is legible and clear, but dosing information is not included; conclusions about antigen content cannot be drawn from the presented immunogenicity data.",
