  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (Log2 scale) against egg-grown and cell-grown HA antigens of A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four vaccine formulations (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4 [Flublok]), plus panels of egg/cell HA titer ratios and stalk-specific titers and fold-rise. Evidence: RIV4 (Flublok) consistently elicits higher ELISA titers and greater stalk-specific antibody fold-rise compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines. The figure demonstrates greater immunogenicity of RIV4 versus standard-dose vaccines but provides no data on the HA antigen content per dose; it therefore does not support the claim about Flublok containing 3\u00d7 the HA antigen content. Note: Analysis based solely on visible immunogenicity data; no information on antigen dose is present.",
