  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram depicting enrollment, randomization, and follow-up of participants over two influenza seasons (2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020). It shows numbers of participants allocated to four vaccine arms in Year 1 (cell-culture quadrivalent, recombinant hemagglutinin [Flublok], FluZone IIV4, and Fluarix IIV4), completion at day 0, 1 month, and 6 months visits, and re-randomization flows in Year 2. The figure is a participant CONSORT diagram and does not present any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity comparisons. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to confirm that no antigen content information is provided.",
