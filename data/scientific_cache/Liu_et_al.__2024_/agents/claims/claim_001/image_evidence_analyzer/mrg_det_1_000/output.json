  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "CONSORT flow diagram for screening and enrollment of participants in a two-year influenza vaccine study, showing numbers of participants randomized and re-randomized across three vaccine arms: inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (IIV4), cell culture-based IIV4 (ccIIV4), and recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok\u00ae). The figure is solely a participant flow diagram showing randomization and re-randomization counts among vaccine groups and provides no data on antigen content or HA dosing; it does not support the claim. Note: Image quality is sufficient to see all text; no antigen content or immunogenicity data are present.",
