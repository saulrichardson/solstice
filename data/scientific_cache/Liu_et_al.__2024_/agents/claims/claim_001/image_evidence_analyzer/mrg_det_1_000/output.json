  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "CONSORT flow diagram showing enrollment, randomization, allocation, and follow-up of participants in two consecutive influenza vaccine study years comparing cell-culture IIV4 (ccIIV4), recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4), and standard egg-based IIV4s (Fluzone, Fluarix). It lists participant numbers by vaccine group and visits completed. does not support the claim because the figure is solely a CONSORT diagram of study enrollment and vaccine allocation; it provides no data on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative immunogenicity of Flublok versus standard-dose vaccines.",
