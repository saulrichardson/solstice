  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Point\u2010and\u2010error\u2010bar plots showing geometric mean fold rise of microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers at 1 month post\u2010vaccination (panels A and B) and geometric mean fold reduction of titers at 6 months post\u2010vaccination (panels C and D) in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). Data are shown for four vaccines: Fluzone IIV4 (open circles), Fluarix IIV4 (black circles), cell\u2010based IIV4 (green circles), and recombinant IIV4 (RIV4, orange circles) against egg\u2010 and cell\u2010propagated A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, and B/YAM antigens, with p values indicating significant differences. Evidence: Panels A and B show that RIV4 (orange) elicits significantly higher geometric mean fold rises in antibody titers at 1 month compared with Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4 for H3N2 and H1N1 strains. The figure demonstrates immunogenicity differences but does not present any data on hemagglutinin antigen content, so it does not support the claim Note: The figure quality is sufficient to see immunogenicity outcomes but no antigen\u2010dose information is provided.",
