  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise in antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B for age groups 18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years, respectively) and geometric mean fold reduction (waning) at 6 months post-vaccination (panels C and D for the same age groups). Data are shown for four vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) across six influenza strains (H3N2 egg, H3N2 cell, H1N1 egg, H1N1 cell, B/Victoria egg, B/Victoria cell, B/Yamagata egg, B/Yamagata cell). Error bars represent 95% CIs and p-values indicate comparisons versus standard-dose IIV4. Evidence: RIV4 (Flublok) exhibited significantly higher 1-month geometric mean fold rises in antibody titers versus standard-dose IIV4 vaccines for multiple strains (e.g., H3N2 egg and cell, H1N1 cell) with p<0.0001 in several comparisons. The figure does not support the claim that Flublok contains 3\u00d7 the HA antigen content, as no antigen dose information is presented, although it does show greater immunogenicity of RIV4 versus standard-dose IIV4. Therefore, it does not support the claim in full. Note: The figure is clear on immunogenicity differences but provides no data on antigen content or dosing; image resolution is sufficient for interpreting the presented immunogenicity data.",
