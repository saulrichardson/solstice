  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise in antibody titers at 1 month post\u2010vaccination (panels A and B for ages 18\u201344 and 45\u201364, respectively) and geometric mean fold reduction at 6 months (panels C and D for the same age groups). Four vaccine groups are compared by colored symbols: egg-based Fluzone IIV4, egg-based Fluarix IIV4, cell-culture IIV4 (ccIIV4), and recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). Data are shown for each influenza strain (H3N2 egg, H3N2 cell, H1N1 egg, H1N1 cell, B/Victoria egg, B/Victoria cell, B/Yamagata egg, B/Yamagata cell) with error bars and p-values for pairwise comparisons. Evidence: RIV4 (Flublok) shows significantly higher 1-month fold rises in H3N2 cell and H1N1 cell antibody titers compared with standard-dose IIV4 vaccines. The figure demonstrates greater immunogenicity of RIV4 versus standard-dose IIV4 vaccines, but it does not provide any information about antigen dosage or the 3\u00d7 HA content, so it does not support the full claim. Note: The data on immunogenicity are clear, but the figure contains no details on HA antigen content or dosage levels.",
