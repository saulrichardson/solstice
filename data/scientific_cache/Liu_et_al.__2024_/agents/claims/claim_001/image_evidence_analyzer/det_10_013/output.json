  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting demographic characteristics and prior influenza vaccination history for study participants grouped by vaccine type (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4). It includes sample sizes (n), mean age (SD), age group distribution, sex, race, site enrollment, and vaccination history. The table provides only demographic and prior vaccination history data for various vaccines; it does not present any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or compare Flublok\u2019s HA content to standard-dose vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image content is clear and limited to demographics; no antigen content data is shown.",
