  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of participant demographic characteristics (age, age group, sex, race/ethnicity, study site, influenza vaccination history) for four groups with sample sizes (n=122, 120, 283, 198). The table presents baseline demographic data and vaccination history of study participants; it does not address HA antigen content or immunogenicity and therefore does not support the claim.",
