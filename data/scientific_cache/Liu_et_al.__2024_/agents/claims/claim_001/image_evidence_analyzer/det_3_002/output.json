  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Composite of eight graphs showing microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) against influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination. Four vaccine groups are plotted: egg-based IIV4 (Fluzone), another egg-based IIV4 (Fluarix), cell-based IIV4 (ccIIV4), and recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4). Individual titers are shown as gray dots; geometric mean titers with 95% CIs are shown, with horizontal bars and p-values indicating significant differences between groups. Evidence: RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) induced higher MN or HI titers at 1 and 6 months compared to the three standard-dose IIV4 vaccines, as indicated by statistically significant p values. The figure does not support the claim that Flublok contains 3\u00d7 the HA antigen content, because it provides only immunogenicity comparisons without any data on antigen content or the 3\u00d7 HA dose specification, although it does show greater immunogenicity for RIV4 versus standard-dose vaccines. Note: Image does not include any quantitative information on HA antigen amounts or dosing; immunogenicity data alone are shown; some p-values and axis labels are small and may be hard to read clearly.",
