  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing geometric mean microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) against four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination. Panels are stratified by age group (18\u201344 vs 45\u201364 years) and by virus antigen preparation (egg-grown vs cell-grown). Four vaccine groups are plotted: standard-dose egg-based IIV4 (Fluzone, black), another IIV4 (blue), cell culture-derived IIV4 (green), and recombinant HA vaccine RIV4 (Flublok, orange). Statistical comparisons (p-values) between groups are annotated. Evidence: RIV4 (orange) elicits higher MN/HI titers than standard-dose egg-based IIV4 in several comparisons (e.g., A(H3N2) titers at 1 month) as indicated by significant p-values. The figure demonstrates that the recombinant HA vaccine (Flublok/RIV4) produces greater immunogenicity compared with standard-dose egg-based flu vaccines, but it does not present data on HA antigen content. Therefore, it does not support the claim regarding the 3\u00d7 HA content, although it shows increased immunogenicity. Note: Image only shows immunogenicity data; no quantitative HA content information is provided. Some p-values are small and panels are densely annotated, but overall legible.",
