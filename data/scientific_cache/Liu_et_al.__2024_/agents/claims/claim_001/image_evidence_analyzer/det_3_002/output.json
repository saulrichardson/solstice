  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing geometric mean neutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (log\u2082 scale) against four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) at Day 0, Month 1, and Month 6. Panels are stratified by age group (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years) and by virus propagated in eggs or cells. Four vaccine groups are compared: Fluzone IIV4 (black), Fluarix IIV4 (blue), cell-culture IIV4 (green), and recombinant HA vaccine RIV4 (orange). P-values indicate statistically significant differences in titers between groups at various time points. The figure does not provide any data on hemagglutinin antigen content for Flublok or standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the part of the claim regarding 3\u00d7 HA content. Although it shows that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) sometimes elicits higher antibody titers, it does not link these differences to antigen dose; therefore, this evidence does not support the claim. Note: The figure is legible and statistical comparisons are visible, but antigen content values are not presented; conclusions about HA dose must not be inferred from titers alone.",
