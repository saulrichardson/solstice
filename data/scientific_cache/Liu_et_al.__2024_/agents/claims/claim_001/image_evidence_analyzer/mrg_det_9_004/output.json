  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (Log2 scale) to egg-derived and cell-derived HA antigens at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination for different vaccine combinations, geometric mean ratios of egg/cell HA ELISA titers, and stalk-specific ELISA titers and fold-rises for H3 and H1 stalks across the same vaccine groups. The figure presents comparative immunogenicity (ELISA titers and fold-rises) among vaccine groups but does not report HA antigen content or indicate a 3\u00d7 HA dose in Flublok; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Image panels are small and some labeling is condensed, but antigen dose information is clearly not shown.",
