  "explanation": "Table listing egg-adapted amino acid substitutions in hemagglutinin proteins of various influenza vaccine virus strains (cell- and egg-derived candidates) with positions, substitutions, and glycosylation motif notes. The table catalogs amino acid substitutions in HA sequences of vaccine viruses and does not provide any data on HA antigen content or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim.",
