  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-row table comparing amino acid differences in the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain across various influenza vaccine seed viruses (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, B/Yamagata), listing positions and residue changes for cell- and egg-derived strains over two years The table only presents amino acid sequence differences in the HA head domain of influenza vaccine strains; it contains no information on HA antigen content, Flublok formulation, dosing or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim",
