  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial page of a clinical document showing text describing exploratory analyses of immunogenicity of repeat influenza vaccination with egg-based (IIV4), cell-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) vaccines, including references to antibody binding and memory responses, but no tables or quantitative antigen content information. The visible content does not provide any data on hemagglutinin antigen content of Flublok versus standard-dose vaccines and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is a cropped text excerpt and does not include any tables or specific antigen quantity data; it may not represent the full page.",
