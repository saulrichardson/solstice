  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multipanel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination for four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Seven repeat vaccination arms are compared: cell-based quadrivalent (ccIIV4) followed by ccIIV4 or RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine), egg-based IIV4 followed by ccIIV4, RIV4, or IIV4. Geometric mean titers with 95% CIs and individual data points are shown, with p values indicating statistical differences between arms. Evidence: Statistically significant higher HI titers in RIV4\u2013RIV4 arms compared to IIV4\u2013IIV4 arms (e.g., p<0.0001 for A/H3N2 and B/Yamagata) The figure shows greater immunogenicity for RIV4 arms versus standard-dose egg-based IIV4 arms but does not present any data on antigen content or the claimed 3\u00d7 HA dose, so it does not support the claim in full Note: The image quality is sufficient to read p values and group labels, but antigen dose information is not provided in the figure",
