  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010panel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log\u2082 scale) at Day 0 and one month post\u2010vaccination against four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years), each vaccinated with various sequences of cell\u2010culture\u2010based quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (ccIIV4), recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4), and egg\u2010based IIV4. Box\u2010and\u2010whisker plots display individual and geometric mean titers with p\u2010values for pairwise comparisons. The figure presents comparative immunogenicity data (HI titers) for RIV4 (Flublok) versus other flu vaccines but does not report antigen content or explicitly link a threefold HA dose difference to the observed antibody responses, so it does not support the claim. Note: Assessment limited to the visible panels; antigen dose information is not shown and statistical comparisons are strain- and cohort-specific.",
