  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multipanel figure of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (log2 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata), in two age cohorts (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) and for egg-grown vs cell-grown virus assays. Within each panel, colored symbols and error bars represent different prime-boost vaccine regimens, including recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), standard inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4), and cell-culture influenza vaccine (ccIIV4), with p-values comparing HI titers between groups. Evidence: At 1 month post-vaccination, RIV4 (recombinant vaccine) groups consistently show higher HI titers than IIV4 groups for multiple strains (e.g., A(H3N2) cell virus p<0.0001; B/Yamagata cell virus p<0.0001). The figure demonstrates greater immunogenicity (higher HI titers) for the recombinant vaccine (Flublok) compared to standard-dose vaccines, but it does not provide any data on the antigen dose (3\u00d7 HA content). Therefore, it does not support the claim that Flublok contains 3\u00d7 the HA antigen content, although it does show greater immunogenicity. Note: The figure clearly shows immunogenicity differences, but antigen content per dose is not indicated; interpretation assumes RIV4 corresponds to Flublok.",
