  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Four\u2010panel figure comparing Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-culture IIV4 (ccIIV4), and recombinant HA vaccine RIV4 across two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). Panels A & B show geometric mean ratios of egg- to cell-propagated virus titers by strain (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM). Panels C & D show the proportion of subjects with \u22654-fold reduced titers to cell-propagated vaccine virus pre- and post-vaccination by strain. The figure presents comparative virological assay results (egg vs cell virus titers and fold-reduction rates) for different vaccine formulations, but it does not report or compare HA antigen content or directly link antigen dose to immunogenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim.",
