  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multipanel figure (panels A\u2013D) showing geometric mean ratios of egg to cell virus titers and proportions of \u22654-fold reduced titers pre- and post-vaccination for four licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell-based IIV4, and recombinant HA RIV4) in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years), with p-values comparing immunogenicity measures. does not support the claim because the figure presents immunogenicity comparisons between vaccine types but does not provide any data on HA antigen content (let alone a 3\u00d7 difference) or link antigen dose to immune response. Note: No mention of HA antigen quantity in the image; immunogenicity data are shown but antigen dose is not specified.",
