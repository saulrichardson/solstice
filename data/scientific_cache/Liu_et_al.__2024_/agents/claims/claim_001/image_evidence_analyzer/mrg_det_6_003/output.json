  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing antibody responses (geometric mean ratio of egg- to cell-derived vaccine virus titers with 95% CI in panels A and B, and proportion with \u22654-fold reduced titer to cell vaccine virus pre- and post-vaccination in panels C and D) for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). The figure does not provide any information about antigen content (HA dose) of the vaccines nor does it consistently show greater immunogenicity for RIV4 vs standard-dose IIV4; therefore it does not support the claim.
