  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two sets of line graphs (A for ages 18\u201344 and B for ages 45\u201364) showing pre- and post-vaccination proportions of participants achieving \u22654-fold reduced HI titer to cell-grown vaccine virus (egg/cell titer ratio \u22654) against four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM) across seven repeat vaccination arms (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-Fluzone IIV4). P values indicate statistical comparisons of pre- vs post-vaccination proportions. The figure presents immunogenicity ratios (egg vs cell HI titers) across different vaccine sequence arms but does not include any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or directly compare antigen doses. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear, but it focuses on HI titer ratios rather than HA dosage levels; no antigen content information is provided.",
