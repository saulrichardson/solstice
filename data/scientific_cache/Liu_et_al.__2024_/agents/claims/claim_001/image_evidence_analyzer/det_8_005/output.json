  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel graph showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers and the proportion of subjects achieving \u22654-fold rises in HI titer before (Pre) and after (Post) vaccination in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Results are plotted for four influenza virus strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM) across several vaccine prime\u2013boost sequences indicated by different marker shapes and colors (ccIIV4, RIV4, IIV4, FluZone IIV4). P-values for some comparisons are noted. The figure depicts immunogenicity outcomes (HI titers and fold-rise proportions) for different vaccine regimens but does not provide any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or a comparison showing 3\u00d7 HA content in Flublok versus standard-dose vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image resolution is adequate; vaccine group labels are clear, but no antigen content information is presented.",
