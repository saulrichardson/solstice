      "quote": "The manufacturing process can lead to egg adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote directly states that the process of producing flu vaccines in eggs can cause mutations in the HA protein, which may change the antigenic properties of the vaccine and reduce its effectiveness, supporting the claim about mutation risk and impact on efficacy."

      "quote": "Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This statement explains that repeated use of egg-based vaccines can enhance immune responses to egg-adapted (mutated) viral regions, potentially at the expense of responses to the actual circulating viruses, thus reducing overall vaccine effectiveness."

      "quote": "Egg adaptation can introduce mutations in the HA protein of influenza viruses used in vaccines, which may alter antigenicity and impact immune responses.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote affirms that mutations (egg adaptation) can occur during vaccine production, changing the antigenic properties of the virus and potentially affecting how well the immune system responds, which is central to the claim."

      "quote": "Several studies have reported that Q223R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides a specific example of a mutation (Q223R) that arises during egg-based production, which changes the virus's antigenicity and can affect the immune response, supporting the claim about mutation risk and reduced effectiveness."
