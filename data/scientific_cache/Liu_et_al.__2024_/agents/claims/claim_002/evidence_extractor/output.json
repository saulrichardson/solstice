      "quote": "Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This statement explains that repeated use of egg-based vaccines can enhance immune responses to egg-adapted (mutated) epitopes rather than those found on circulating viruses, potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness."

      "quote": "Egg adaptation can introduce mutations in the HA protein that are not present in circulating viruses, potentially leading to a mismatch between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote highlights that mutations arising during egg-based vaccine production can cause the vaccine strain to differ from the circulating virus, which may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness."

      "quote": "Several studies have reported that Q223R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides a specific example of a mutation (Q223R) that occurs during egg-based production, which alters the antigenic properties of the virus and can affect the immune response, supporting the claim about reduced effectiveness."
