      "quote": "The manufacturing process can lead to egg adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the manufacturing process (specifically for egg-based vaccines) can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein, which could alter antigenicity and reduce vaccine effectiveness. This matches the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."

      "quote": "Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted (mutated) epitopes, which are changes that occur during egg-based production. It also states this can reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses, meaning the immune response to the actual viruses in circulation may be less effective. This matches the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness."

    {
      "quote": "Egg adaptation can introduce mutations in the HA protein of influenza viruses used in vaccines, which may alter antigenicity and impact immune responses.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim by stating that egg adaptation (a process during egg-based vaccine production) can introduce mutations in the HA protein, which can alter antigenicity and influence (i.e., potentially reduce) immune responses. This is central to the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The document does not mention cell-based adaptation in this context, but it does confirm the mechanism for egg-based vaccines as described in the claim."

    {
      "quote": "Several studies have reported that Q223R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides a specific example (Q223R mutation) that arises during egg-based production of flu vaccines, and explicitly states that this mutation can alter antigenicity and influence the immune response. This demonstrates that mutations can occur during production and may reduce vaccine effectiveness, as the claim asserts."

      "explanation": "A table comparing amino acid residues at key positions in the HA head domain of various influenza candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs), showing cell-based CVVs and multiple egg-based CVVs for A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata lineages across different seasons. Evidence: Egg-propagated CVVs exhibit specific amino acid substitutions (e.g., Q\u2192R at position 223, S\u2192M at 183 in A/Michigan/45/2015 egg CVV; loss of glycosylation at N(CHO-) sites in H3N2 egg CVVs) compared to cell-derived CVVs. The table documents mutations arising in egg-based vaccine viruses during production, supports the claim that production methods can introduce mutations that may reduce vaccine effectiveness. Note: Does not show direct efficacy measurements; cell-based CVV mutations relative to wild-type are not explicitly detailed; sequence table only implies potential antigenic impact."

      "explanation": "Composite figure with four panels (A\u2013D) comparing antibody responses to egg-grown versus cell-grown influenza vaccine viruses in two adult age groups (18\u201344 years in A and C; 45\u201364 years in B and D). Panels A and B plot the geometric mean ratio of hemagglutination inhibition titers against egg-grown virus over titers against cell-grown virus for four licensed vaccines (egg-based: Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4; cell-based: ccIIV4; recombinant: RIV4). Panels C and D show the proportion of subjects with a \u22654-fold reduced titer to the cell-grown vaccine virus pre- and post-vaccination. Statistical annotations indicate significant differences between vaccine types. Evidence: In panels A and B, egg-based vaccines produce significantly higher egg-to-cell titer ratios (p\u22640.0021 for A/H3N2, p<0.0001 for older adults), and in panels C and D a high proportion of egg-vaccine recipients show \u22654-fold reduced titers to cell-grown virus (58% pre to 26% post for A/H3N2; p=0.0001 and p=0.005). These data support the claim by showing that egg-based vaccine viruses exhibit antigenic differences (presumably from egg-adaptation mutations) that reduce antibody recognition of cell-grown (wild-type) virus, and that cell-based and recombinant platforms have smaller mismatches. Thus, production in eggs (and to a lesser extent in cells) can introduce mutations that diminish vaccine effectiveness \u2013 supports the claim. Note: Interpretation based on immunogenicity data as a proxy for antigenic mutations; no direct genetic sequencing is shown. Figure text was small and required inference of vaccine types from legend symbols."
