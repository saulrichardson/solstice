      "quote": "The manufacturing process can lead to egg adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the manufacturing process (specifically for egg-based vaccines) can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein, which could alter antigenicity and reduce vaccine effectiveness. This matches the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."

    {
      "quote": "Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted (mutated) epitopes, which are not present on circulating viruses, and that this can reduce immunogenicity to the actual circulating viruses. This means that mutations arising during egg-based vaccine production can lead to immune responses that are less effective against real-world flu strains, thus reducing vaccine effectiveness. This is exactly what the claim asserts."

    {
      "quote": "Several studies have reported that Q223R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It states that the Q223R mutation, which arises as an egg-adapted change during production, can alter the antigenicity of the virus and influence the immune response. This provides a specific example of how egg-based (and by extension, cell-based if similar mutations occur) vaccine production can lead to mutations that may reduce vaccine effectiveness, thus substantiating the claim."

      "quote": "Table 1. Amino acid differences between egg- and cell-propagated vaccine viruses used in the study. For example, A/Brisbane/02/2018 egg virus has a G at position 45, while the cell virus has an R. These differences indicate that mutations can occur during egg or cell propagation of vaccine viruses.",
      "explanation": "The quote (and the corresponding content in the document) directly supports the claim. The table and text explicitly show that there are amino acid differences (mutations) between egg- and cell-propagated vaccine viruses, which arise during the production process. This demonstrates the mechanism by which such mutations could potentially reduce vaccine effectiveness, as the claim asserts. The document does not require inference to connect these facts to the claim; it is explicit that mutations occur during propagation."

      "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table listing influenza virus strains (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) by year, with comparisons between cell\u2010derived seed strains and various egg-propagated candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). Across specified HA head domain positions (e.g., 45, 74, 120, 223, etc.), the table shows amino acid residues for each strain, highlighting differences (mutations) that arose in egg-based or cell-based propagation. Evidence: Multiple entries show amino acid substitutions at HA head positions when the same virus is grown in cells versus eggs (e.g., A/Idaho/07/2018 cell has Q at position 209 vs R in the egg version; B/Colorado/06/2017 cell has N at 197 vs T(CHO-) in the egg version), indicating mutations acquired during production. The table documents clear sequence changes (mutations) introduced during both cell- and egg-based vaccine virus propagation, which supports the claim that these production methods can generate mutations that may alter antigenic properties and thus potentially reduce effectiveness. Note: The table only presents sequence differences; it does not include functional or clinical efficacy data to directly demonstrate reduced vaccine effectiveness."

      "explanation": "Four\u2010panel figure showing, in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years), (A and B) geometric mean ratios (with 95% CIs) of hemagglutination inhibition titers against egg\u2010grown versus cell\u2010grown vaccine virus for four vaccine types (Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4 egg\u2010based, ccIIV4 cell\u2010based, and RIV4 recombinant) and (C and D) pre\u2010 and post\u2010vaccination proportions of subjects with \u22654\u2010fold reduced titers to cell\u2010grown vaccine virus for each vaccine type and strain (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM), with p\u2010values indicating significant differences. Evidence: Panels A and B show that both egg\u2010based (Fluzone, Fluarix) and cell\u2010based (ccIIV4) vaccines elicit significantly higher titers to egg\u2010grown virus than to cell\u2010grown virus (geometric mean ratios >1, p<0.05), and Panels C and D show nonzero proportions of \u22654\u2010fold reduced titers to cell virus after ccIIV4 immunization, indicating antigenic mismatch likely due to production\u2010associated mutations. The data demonstrate that vaccine strains grown in eggs or in cell culture acquire antigenic changes that reduce antibody recognition of the cell\u2010grown virus, which supports the claim Note: Interpretation is based on HAI titer ratios as a proxy for antigenic changes; the figure does not show direct sequencing of mutations. Assay context and vaccine strain specifics may introduce variability."
