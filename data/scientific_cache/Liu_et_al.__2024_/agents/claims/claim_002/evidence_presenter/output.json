    {
      "quote": "The manufacturing process can lead to egg adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the manufacturing process (specifically for egg-based vaccines) can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein, which could alter antigenicity and reduce vaccine effectiveness. This matches the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."

    {
      "quote": "Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted (mutated) epitopes, which are not present on circulating viruses, and that this can reduce immunogenicity (immune response) to the actual circulating viruses. This means that mutations arising during egg-based vaccine production can lead to a less effective immune response against the real-world virus, thus potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness, which is exactly what the claim asserts."

    {
      "quote": "Several studies have reported that Q223R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It states that the Q223R mutation, which arises as an egg-adapted change in the HA head domain of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity, and influence immune response. This demonstrates that mutations can develop during egg-based vaccine production and that these mutations can alter the antigenic properties of the virus and affect the immune response, which may reduce vaccine effectiveness. Thus, the quote provides a specific example that substantiates the claim."

    {
      "quote": "Egg adaptation can introduce mutations in the HA protein that are not present in circulating viruses, potentially leading to a mismatch between vaccine-induced immunity and the actual viruses causing infection. Several studies have reported that Q223R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response.",
      "explanation": "The quote, as found in the document, directly supports the claim. It states that egg adaptation can introduce mutations in the HA protein (such as Q223R) that are not present in circulating viruses, and that these mutations can alter antigenicity and influence immune response. This provides a mechanistic explanation for how mutations arising during vaccine production (specifically in eggs) can reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine, thus supporting the claim."

    {
      "quote": "Multiple seasons of non-egg based vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immune memory to egg adapted epitopes and re-focus the immune response towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It states that immune memory can be focused on egg-adapted epitopes (which arise due to mutations during egg-based vaccine production), and that this can reduce vaccine effectiveness against circulating viruses. The need to redirect immune responses away from these egg-adapted epitopes by using non-egg-based vaccines implies that mutations acquired during production in eggs can reduce effectiveness, thus substantiating the claim."

      "explanation": "Sixteen box\u2010and\u2010whisker plots arranged in a 4\u00d74 grid showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log\u2082 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month (1 m) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 yrs and 45\u201364 yrs) vaccinated with either egg\u2010propagated (\u2018egg virus\u2019) or cell\u2010propagated (\u2018cell virus\u2019) influenza vaccines. Rows correspond to four influenza strains/subtypes (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Within each plot, colored symbols represent HI titers against homologous and heterologous viruses (egg\u2010derived vs. cell\u2010derived), and horizontal bars with p-values indicate statistically significant differences in titers at 1 month between egg\u2010 and cell\u2010propagated viruses. Evidence: In recipients of egg\u2010based vaccines, HI titers against cell\u2010propagated A(H3N2) at 1 month are significantly lower (e.g., p<0.0001 in 18\u201344 yr group), indicating reduced antibody recognition of the cell\u2010grown strain. Similar significant differences are seen for other strains and age groups. The significant reductions in HI titers against cell\u2010propagated viruses in individuals vaccinated with egg\u2010propagated vaccines demonstrate that production method can alter antigenicity and reduce immune recognition, which supports the claim Note: The figure shows differential antibody responses rather than directly displaying mutation analyses; inference of mutations is indirect but consistent with known egg\u2010adaptation effects."

      "explanation": "Scatter plots comparing pre- and post-vaccination proportions of subjects with \u22654-fold reduced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers to cell-propagated influenza vaccine viruses, stratified by viral strain (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM), age group (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years), and vaccine type (egg-based IIV4-Fluzone, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4, in various prime/boost combinations). Evidence: Recipients of egg-based IIV4-Fluzone showed a significantly higher proportion of \u22654-fold reduced HI titers against cell-derived A(H1N1)pdm09 (p=0.02) and B/VIC (p=0.03) viruses compared with cell-based vaccines. The figure supports the claim by demonstrating that egg-based vaccine recipients had diminished serologic responses to cell-propagated virus strains, consistent with egg-adapted mutations during production that may reduce vaccine effectiveness. Note: Immunologic titers are surrogates and the figure does not directly display genetic sequence mutations during vaccine production."
