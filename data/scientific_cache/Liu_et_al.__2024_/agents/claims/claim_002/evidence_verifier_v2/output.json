      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that the manufacturing process (specifically for egg-based vaccines) can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein, which could alter antigenicity and reduce vaccine effectiveness. This matches the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

Despite the artifacts, the factual content is preserved: the manufacturing process can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein in inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), which could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population.",

      "original_relevance": "This quote directly states that the process of producing flu vaccines in eggs can cause mutations in the HA protein, which may change the antigenic properties of the vaccine and reduce its effectiveness, supporting the claim about mutation risk and impact on efficacy."

      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted (mutated) epitopes, which are changes that occur during egg-based production. It also states this can reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses, meaning the immune response to the actual viruses in circulation may be less effective. This matches the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote 'Repeat vaccination with egg based influenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.' appears verbatim on page 1 of the document. The only differences are minor OCR corrections (e.g., 'immunogen i city' to 'immunogenicity', 'epi to pes' to 'epitopes'), but the factual content and meaning are preserved.",

This matches the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production that may reduce their effectiveness.",
      "original_relevance": "This statement explains that repeated use of egg-based vaccines can enhance immune responses to egg-adapted (mutated) viral regions, potentially at the expense of responses to the actual circulating viruses, thus reducing overall vaccine effectiveness."

      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim by stating that egg adaptation (a process during egg-based vaccine production) can introduce mutations in the HA protein, which can alter antigenicity and influence (i.e., potentially reduce) immune responses. This is central to the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness. The document does not mention cell-based adaptation in this context, but it does confirm the mechanism for egg-based vaccines as described in the claim.",
      "presence_explanation": "A semantically equivalent statement appears on page 9: 'have reported that Q223 R egg adapted change at the HA head domain of A (H1 N1) pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigen i city and influence immune response 37 42.' This matches the factual content of the quote: 'Egg adaptation can introduce mutations in the HA protein of influenza viruses used in vaccines, which may alter antigenicity and impact immune responses.' The document explicitly discusses egg adaptation introducing mutations in the HA protein, altering antigenicity, and impacting immune response.",
