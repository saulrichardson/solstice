It explicitly states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted (mutated) epitopes, which are not present on circulating viruses, and that this can reduce immunogenicity (immune response) to the actual circulating viruses. This means that mutations arising during egg-based vaccine production can lead to a less effective immune response against the real-world virus, thus potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness, which is exactly what the claim asserts.",
