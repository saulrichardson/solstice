It explicitly states that the manufacturing process (specifically for egg-based vaccines) can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein, which could alter antigenicity and reduce vaccine effectiveness.

The relevant passage is: 'manufacturing process can lead to egg adapted mutations in themagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered an ...iff i (VE) i h i l i'. Despite the OCR issues, the semantic content matches the quote to be verified: the manufacturing process can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the HA protein in inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), which could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population.",

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines can preferentially boost antibodies to egg-adapted (mutated) epitopes, which are not present on circulating viruses, and that this can reduce immunogenicity to the actual circulating viruses. This means that mutations arising during egg-based vaccine production can lead to immune responses that are less effective against real-world flu strains, thus reducing vaccine effectiveness.

It states that the Q223R mutation, which arises as an egg-adapted change during production, can alter the antigenicity of the virus and influence the immune response.
