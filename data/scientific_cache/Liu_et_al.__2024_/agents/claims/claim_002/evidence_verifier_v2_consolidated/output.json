Panels A and B plot the geometric mean ratio of hemagglutination inhibition titers against egg-grown virus over titers against cell-grown virus for four licensed vaccines (egg-based: Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4; cell-based: ccIIV4; recombinant: RIV4). Panels C and D show the proportion of subjects with a \u22654-fold reduced titer to the cell-grown vaccine virus pre- and post-vaccination. Statistical annotations indicate significant differences between vaccine types. Evidence: In panels A and B, egg-based vaccines produce significantly higher egg-to-cell titer ratios (p\u22640.0021 for A/H3N2, p<0.0001 for older adults), and in panels C and D a high proportion of egg-vaccine recipients show \u22654-fold reduced titers to cell-grown virus (58% pre to 26% post for A/H3N2; p=0.0001 and p=0.005). These data support the claim by showing that egg-based vaccine viruses exhibit antigenic differences (presumably from egg-adaptation mutations) that reduce antibody recognition of cell-grown (wild-type) virus, and that cell-based and recombinant platforms have smaller mismatches. Thus, production in eggs (and to a lesser extent in cells) can introduce mutations that diminish vaccine effectiveness \u2013 supports the claim. Note: Interpretation based on immunogenicity data as a proxy for antigenic mutations; no direct genetic sequencing is shown.
