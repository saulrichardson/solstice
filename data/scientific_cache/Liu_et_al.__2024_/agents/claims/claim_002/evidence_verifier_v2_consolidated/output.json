The significant reductions in HI titers against cell\u2010propagated viruses in individuals vaccinated with egg\u2010propagated vaccines demonstrate that production method can alter antigenicity and reduce immune recognition, which supports the claim Note: The figure shows differential antibody responses rather than directly displaying mutation analyses; inference of mutations is indirect but consistent with known egg\u2010adaptation effects.",
