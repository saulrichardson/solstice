  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing demographic characteristics (mean age, age group distribution, sex, race/ethnicity), study site distribution, and prior influenza vaccination history for four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) with sample sizes and percentages. The table only presents participant demographics and vaccination history; it does not provide any data or discussion on production-related mutations or their impact on vaccine effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to read all entries; however, the table content is limited to demographics and prior vaccination history and contains no information on viral mutations or effectiveness.",
