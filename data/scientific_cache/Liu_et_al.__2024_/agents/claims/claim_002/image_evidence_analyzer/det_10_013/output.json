  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, site) and influenza vaccination history for study groups (n=122, 120, 283, 198), followed by partial text from the Materials and Methods section describing egg- and cell-propagated virus strains and immunogenicity assays. The table and accompanying methods text describe participant demographics, vaccine history, and virus propagation methods but do not present any data or statements about mutations arising during egg- or cell-based vaccine production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Text is partially cut off and low resolution, but no mention of mutation or effectiveness was visible.",
