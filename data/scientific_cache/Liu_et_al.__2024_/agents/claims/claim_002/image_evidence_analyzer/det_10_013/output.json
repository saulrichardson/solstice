  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A table presenting demographic characteristics and prior influenza vaccination history of study participants across four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4), showing counts and percentages for mean age, age groups, sex, race/ethnicity, study site, and prior vaccination history. does not support the claim because the table only provides baseline participant demographics and vaccination history, with no information on vaccine production mutations or their impact on effectiveness. Note: Image quality is adequate to read demographics but contains no data on mutations or reduced vaccine effectiveness.",
