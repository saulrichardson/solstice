  "explanation": "A table presenting demographic characteristics and prior influenza vaccination history of study participants across four vaccine groups (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4), including sample size, mean age, age distribution, sex, race/ethnicity, study site, and previous vaccination rates. The table only provides participant demographics and vaccination histories and contains no data or statements regarding mutations arising during production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim Note: Analysis limited to visible table; no production or mutation information is presented",
