  "explanation": "Table listing influenza vaccine strains (cell-derived and egg-derived) and the amino acid differences on the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain at various positions for different A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata lineage viruses. Evidence: The table shows specific amino acid differences (mutations) between cell-based and egg-based vaccine viruses. The table documents that cell- and egg-based vaccine viruses can acquire mutations during production but does not provide any data linking these mutations to reduced vaccine effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim.",
