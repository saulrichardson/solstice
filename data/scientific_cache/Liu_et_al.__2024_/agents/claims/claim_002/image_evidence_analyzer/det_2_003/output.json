  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A multi-part table comparing amino acid sequences of hemagglutinin from cell-based versus egg-based influenza vaccine viruses across multiple strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Specific HA positions (e.g., 91, 121, 128, etc.) are listed as columns. Rows show the amino acids in cell-grown vaccine seed viruses and corresponding egg-grown candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). Egg-adapted substitutions are highlighted in bold/italic and glycosylation motif losses are marked \u201c(CHO-)\u201d. Evidence: Multiple egg-based vaccine viruses (e.g., A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 egg CVV, A/Kansas/14/2017 egg) display egg-adapted amino acid substitutions (italic/bold) and glycosylation motif losses (CHO-), which are absent in the cell-based counterparts. The table supports the claim by directly demonstrating that egg-based vaccine strains acquire specific HA mutations (including glycosylation motif losses) during production, which could alter antigenicity and potentially reduce vaccine effectiveness, thus supports the claim.",
