  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A table comparing amino acid residues at key positions in the HA head domain of various influenza candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs), showing cell-based CVVs and multiple egg-based CVVs for A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata lineages across different seasons. Evidence: Egg-propagated CVVs exhibit specific amino acid substitutions (e.g., Q\u2192R at position 223, S\u2192M at 183 in A/Michigan/45/2015 egg CVV; loss of glycosylation at N(CHO-) sites in H3N2 egg CVVs) compared to cell-derived CVVs. The table documents mutations arising in egg-based vaccine viruses during production, supports the claim that production methods can introduce mutations that may reduce vaccine effectiveness. Note: Does not show direct efficacy measurements; cell-based CVV mutations relative to wild-type are not explicitly detailed; sequence table only implies potential antigenic impact.",
