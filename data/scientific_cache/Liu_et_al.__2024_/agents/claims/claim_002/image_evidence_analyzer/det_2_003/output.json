  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table listing influenza virus strains (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) by year, with comparisons between cell\u2010derived seed strains and various egg-propagated candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). Across specified HA head domain positions (e.g., 45, 74, 120, 223, etc.), the table shows amino acid residues for each strain, highlighting differences (mutations) that arose in egg-based or cell-based propagation. Evidence: Multiple entries show amino acid substitutions at HA head positions when the same virus is grown in cells versus eggs (e.g., A/Idaho/07/2018 cell has Q at position 209 vs R in the egg version; B/Colorado/06/2017 cell has N at 197 vs T(CHO-) in the egg version), indicating mutations acquired during production. The table documents clear sequence changes (mutations) introduced during both cell- and egg-based vaccine virus propagation, which supports the claim that these production methods can generate mutations that may alter antigenic properties and thus potentially reduce effectiveness. Note: The table only presents sequence differences; it does not include functional or clinical efficacy data to directly demonstrate reduced vaccine effectiveness.",
