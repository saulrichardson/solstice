  "explanation": "Composite figure showing ELISA antibody titers (Log2 scale) against egg\u2010derived HA and cell\u2010derived HA antigens for four licensed influenza vaccines (two egg\u2010based: Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4; one cell\u2010culture based: ccIIV4; one recombinant: RIV4) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post\u2010vaccination (Panel A), the geometric mean ratio of egg HA to cell HA ELISA titers at 1 month (Panel B), stalk\u2010specific ELISA titers against H3 and H1 stalk domains over time (Panel C), and fold\u2010rise of stalk ELISA titers at 1 month versus Day 0 (Panel D). The figure presents immunogenicity data comparing antibody responses to egg-derived versus cell-derived hemagglutinin, but does not show any data on mutations arising during vaccine production or directly link such mutations to reduced effectiveness. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Interpretation limited by absence of sequence or functional data on production\u2010induced mutations; only antibody binding titers are shown.",
