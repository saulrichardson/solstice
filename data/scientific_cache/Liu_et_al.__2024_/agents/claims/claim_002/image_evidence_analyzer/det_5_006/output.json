  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Figure with four panels (A\u2013D) showing ELISA antibody responses to HA head and stalk regions for four influenza vaccine formulations (egg-based Fluzone IIV4 and Fluad IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) measured at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination. Panel A shows log-scale HA head titers for A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Vic, and B/Yam; Panel B shows geometric mean ratios of egg-derived vs cell-derived HA ELISA titers; Panel C shows HA stalk-binding titers; Panel D shows HA stalk fold-rise over baseline. The figure presents comparative antibody titers and ratios between egg-based and cell-based vaccines but does not present any data on viral mutations arising during vaccine production or link those mutations to vaccine effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: No sequencing or mutation analysis is shown; conclusions are limited to immunogenicity comparisons.",
