  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure (A\u2013D) showing ELISA antibody titers (Log2 scale) against egg-derived versus cell-derived hemagglutinin (HA) for influenza A (H3N2, H1N1pdm09) and B (Victoria, Yamagata) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination with four vaccine types (egg-based IIV4, cell-based IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4). Panel B shows geometric mean egg/cell HA titer ratios at 1 month. Panel C shows stalk-specific titers, and Panel D shows HA stalk fold rise. The figure presents comparative antibody binding to egg- versus cell-produced HA antigens but does not provide data on actual production-related mutations or their impact on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The data are immunogenicity measures and antigen source comparisons, not direct assessments of viral sequence mutations or clinical efficacy.",
