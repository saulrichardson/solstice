  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi\u2010panel ELISA immunogenicity data comparing antibody titers against egg\u2010grown and cell\u2010grown hemagglutinin (HA) for A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post\u2010vaccination with four influenza vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4), plus stalk domain titer and fold\u2010rise data. Evidence: Panel B demonstrates that egg\u2010based vaccines elicit higher geometric mean egg/cell HA ELISA titer ratios (significantly >1), consistent with egg\u2010adapted HA changes, whereas the cell\u2010based vaccine (ccIIV4) shows ratios near 1. The figure shows evidence of egg\u2010adapted antigenic changes (supports egg-based mutation potential) but does not show any analogous differences for cell-based vaccine production, so it does not support the claim that both cell- and egg-based vaccines develop mutations during production affecting effectiveness. Note: Text and axis labels are small; interpretation is limited to visible p-values and bar comparisons; no direct mutation or efficacy data are shown.",
