  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise of microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers at 1 month post\u2010vaccination (panels A and B) and geometric mean fold reduction of antibody titers at 6 months post\u2010vaccination (panels C and D) in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Each plot compares responses against egg\u2010propagated versus cell\u2010propagated influenza virus antigens for four vaccine formulations (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) across multiple viral strains (H3N2, H1N1, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). P-values indicate statistical comparisons between vaccines and antigen propagation methods. The figure reports immunogenicity differences against egg\u2010 and cell\u2010propagated antigens but does not present data on production\u2010induced mutations or their impact on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim.",
