  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise in antibody titers 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B) and geometric mean fold reduction in antibody titers 6 months post-vaccination (panels C and D) for two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) and six influenza strains (H3N2 egg, H3N2 cell, H1N1 egg, H1N1 cell, B/Victoria egg, B/Victoria cell, B/Yamagata egg, B/Yamagata cell). Four vaccine formulations are compared: Fluzone IIV4 (egg-based), Fluarix IIV4 (egg-based), ccIIV4 (cell-based), and RIV4 (recombinant), with p-values indicating statistical differences in antibody responses. The figure presents immunogenicity data comparing antibody titer responses across vaccine types but contains no data on viral mutations arising during egg- or cell-based manufacturing or their impact on effectiveness; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Resolution of small p-value annotations may limit identification of subtle annotations, but no mutation data are visible.",
