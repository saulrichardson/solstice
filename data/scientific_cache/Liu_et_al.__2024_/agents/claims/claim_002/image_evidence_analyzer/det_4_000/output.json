  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010panel set of dot\u2010and\u2010bar plots showing geometric mean fold rise in antibody titers at 1 month post\u2010vaccination (panels A and B) and mean fold reduction at 6 months (panels C and D) for adults aged 18\u201344 and 45\u201364. Data are shown for four vaccine formulations (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, cell\u2010culture\u2013derived ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) against multiple influenza strains (H3N2 egg, H3N2 cell, H1N1 egg, H1N1 cell, B/Victoria egg, B/Victoria cell, B/Yamagata egg, B/Yamagata cell), with p\u2010values comparing titers between vaccine types. The figure presents antibody titer responses and waning over time for different vaccine formulations but contains no data or statements about mutations arising during egg\u2010 or cell\u2010based production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible immunogenicity data; full caption or accompanying text might discuss production issues but is not shown.",
