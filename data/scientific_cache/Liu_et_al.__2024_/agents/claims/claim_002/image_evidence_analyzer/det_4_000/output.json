  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing geometric mean fold rise in antibody titers at 1 month post-vaccination (panels A and B for ages 18\u201344 and 45\u201364) and geometric mean fold reduction in titers at 6 months (panels C and D). Each panel compares four vaccine formulations (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) across six influenza strains: H3N2 egg, H3N2 cell, H1N1 egg, H1N1 cell, B/Victoria egg, B/Victoria cell, B/Yamagata egg, B/Yamagata cell. Data points with error bars and p-values indicate statistical differences in antibody responses by vaccine type and strain. The figure presents immunogenicity data comparing egg-based, cell-based, and recombinant influenza vaccines by measuring antibody titer changes, but it does not present any evidence of mutations arising during production or their impact on effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clear but does not address production-related mutations or antigenic changes; only immunogenicity is shown.",
