  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Four-panel figure showing, for two age groups (18\u201344 years in panels A and C; 45\u201364 years in panels B and D), comparisons of immune responses (geometric mean ratios and proportions of \u22654-fold reduced titers) to egg-grown versus cell-grown influenza vaccine viruses (strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) after vaccination with four quadrivalent vaccines (two egg-based, one cell-based, one recombinant). P-values indicate significant differences for egg-based vaccines relative to cell-grown viruses. The figure does not support the claim because it only shows that egg-based vaccines may yield antigenic changes (egg-adaptation) affecting immune recognition of cell-grown virus, but it provides no evidence that cell-based vaccines develop mutations during production that reduce effectiveness; therefore it doesn't support the claim. Note: No direct data on cell-based vaccine production mutations are presented; conclusions are limited to egg-based adaptation effects.",
