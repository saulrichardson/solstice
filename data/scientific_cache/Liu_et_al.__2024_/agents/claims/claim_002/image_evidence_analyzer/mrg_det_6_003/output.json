  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Four\u2010panel figure showing, in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years), (A and B) geometric mean ratios (with 95% CIs) of hemagglutination inhibition titers against egg\u2010grown versus cell\u2010grown vaccine virus for four vaccine types (Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4 egg\u2010based, ccIIV4 cell\u2010based, and RIV4 recombinant) and (C and D) pre\u2010 and post\u2010vaccination proportions of subjects with \u22654\u2010fold reduced titers to cell\u2010grown vaccine virus for each vaccine type and strain (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM), with p\u2010values indicating significant differences. Evidence: Panels A and B show that both egg\u2010based (Fluzone, Fluarix) and cell\u2010based (ccIIV4) vaccines elicit significantly higher titers to egg\u2010grown virus than to cell\u2010grown virus (geometric mean ratios >1, p<0.05), and Panels C and D show nonzero proportions of \u22654\u2010fold reduced titers to cell virus after ccIIV4 immunization, indicating antigenic mismatch likely due to production\u2010associated mutations. The data demonstrate that vaccine strains grown in eggs or in cell culture acquire antigenic changes that reduce antibody recognition of the cell\u2010grown virus, which supports the claim Note: Interpretation is based on HAI titer ratios as a proxy for antigenic changes; the figure does not show direct sequencing of mutations. Assay context and vaccine strain specifics may introduce variability.",
