  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A composite figure with four panels (A\u2013D). Panels A and B show geometric mean ratios of antibody titers against egg-grown versus cell-grown vaccine virus (egg/cell titer ratio) at one month post-vaccination with 95% CIs for each vaccine type (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) in two age groups (18\u201344 years in A; 45\u201364 years in B) across four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM). Horizontal bars indicate significant differences in egg/cell ratios between vaccines (with p-values). Panels C and D show the proportion of participants with an egg/cell titer ratio \u22654-fold at pre- and one-month post-vaccination, with trend-line p-values for RIV4. Evidence: Egg-based vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4) show significantly higher egg/cell titer ratios for A(H3N2) compared to cell-based (ccIIV4) or recombinant (RIV4) vaccines, indicating egg-adapted antigenic changes; no comparable data on cell-based vaccine production mutations. does not support the claim because the figure demonstrates egg-based vaccine adaptation but provides no evidence that cell-based flu vaccines develop production mutations that reduce effectiveness Note: Limited to the visible immunogenicity data; figure resolution may obscure additional annotations or context",
