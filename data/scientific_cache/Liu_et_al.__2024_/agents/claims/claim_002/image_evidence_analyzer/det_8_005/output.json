  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "Two-panel line graph showing, for age groups 18\u201344 years (A) and 45\u201364 years (B), the proportion of participants in seven repeat\u2010vaccination arms with \u22654\u2010fold reduced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer against cell\u2010grown vaccine virus (egg/cell titer ratio \u22654) before and one month after Year 2 vaccination. Results are shown for four vaccine components (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) with p-values for significant pre-to-post increases noted on trend lines. Seven vaccine arms (egg- and cell-based and recombinant combinations) are distinguished by different symbols and colors. Evidence: Significant increases in the proportion of participants with \u22654-fold reduced HI titer to cell-grown virus after vaccination for egg-based components (A(H1N1)pdm09 p=0.02, B/Victoria p=0.03 in 18\u201344 years; A(H3N2) p=0.04 in 45\u201364 years), indicating egg-adaptation mutations that reduce antibody recognition. The figure demonstrates that egg-based vaccine viruses acquire egg-adaptive mutations that lead to significantly reduced HI titers against the corresponding cell-grown virus, which supports the claim by showing production\u2010related mutations that can reduce vaccine effectiveness. Note: Some text and symbols are small and may be difficult to read, but key p-values and trends are legible.",
