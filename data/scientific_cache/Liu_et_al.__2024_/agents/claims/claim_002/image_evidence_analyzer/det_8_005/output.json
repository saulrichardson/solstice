  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Scatter\u2010plot panels showing pre- and post-vaccination hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers or fold-reduction rates against cell-grown vaccine virus strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). Each symbol/color represents a different vaccine sequence of egg-based (IIV4, Fluzone) and cell-based (ccIIV4, RIV4) production or mixed sequences, with p-values indicated for some comparisons. The figure presents serologic outcomes (HI titers) for different vaccine production methods but does not show or measure mutations arising during egg- or cell-based production. It therefore does not support the claim about production-induced mutations reducing vaccine effectiveness. Note: Image does not include sequence or genetic analyses; context limited to immunogenicity data. Some text is small and resolution may obscure detailed legend labels.",
