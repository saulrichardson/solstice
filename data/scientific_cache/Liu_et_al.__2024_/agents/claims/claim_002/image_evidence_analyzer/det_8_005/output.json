  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Two-panel figure (A: ages 18\u201344; B: ages 45\u201364) showing for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, B/YAM) the proportion of subjects with \u22654-fold reduced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers to a cell-propagated vaccine virus antigen, before ('Pre') and after ('Post') vaccination. Individual data points are plotted for seven different vaccine regimens (egg-based IIV4, cell-based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4 and mixed sequences of these), with p-values indicating significant pre/post changes for certain strain\u2013age group combinations. The figure presents immunogenicity data (proportions of reduced HI titers) but does not show any information on mutations arising during vaccine virus production or directly link production methods to antigenic changes. Therefore, it doesn't support the claim. Note: No direct genetic or virological mutation data are displayed; interpretation limited to antibody response.",
