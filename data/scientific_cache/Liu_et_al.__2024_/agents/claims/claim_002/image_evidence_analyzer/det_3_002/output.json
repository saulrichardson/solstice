  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multipanel figure showing geometric mean neutralizing (MN) and hemagglutination\u2010inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) measured at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months after vaccination in two age groups (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years). Columns compare responses against egg\u2010propagated versus cell\u2010propagated influenza viruses, and rows cover four viral strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Within each panel, colored symbols represent four vaccine formulations (Fluzone IIV4, Fluad IIV4, ccIIV4, RIV4) and horizontal lines with p-values indicate statistical comparisons between groups. The figure reports serologic titers against egg- and cell-grown viruses but does not show any data on mutations arising during vaccine virus production nor directly link such mutations to reduced vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim Note: The image is clear and panels are legible, but no mutation or sequence data are presented, and immunogenicity differences alone do not prove production-induced viral mutations.",
