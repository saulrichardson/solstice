  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months post-vaccination for four influenza vaccines (two egg-based IIV4s, one cell-based ccIIV4, and one recombinant RIV4) against different influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) in two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years). Each panel presents geometric mean titers with 95% confidence intervals and individual data points, with statistical comparisons between vaccine groups. does not support the claim because the figure presents post-vaccination antibody responses and does not provide any data on viral mutations arising during vaccine production Note: The figure focuses on immunogenicity outcomes and does not include sequence or mutation analysis, so mutation-related conclusions cannot be drawn from it.",
