  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi\u2010panel figure showing neutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers on a log2 scale against four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) at Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months. Panels are organized by age group (18\u201344 years and 45\u201364 years) and by the assay virus source (egg\u2010propagated virus vs. cell\u2010propagated virus). Four vaccine formulations are compared: two egg-based inactivated vaccines (Fluzone IIV4, Fluarix IIV4), a cell-culture based inactivated vaccine (ccIIV4), and a recombinant vaccine (RIV4). Individual data points, geometric mean titers with confidence bars, and p-value annotations are shown. The figure presents post\u2010vaccination antibody titers measured against egg- and cell-propagated virus antigens and compares immunogenicity of different vaccine formulations. It does not show any data on mutations arising during vaccine production or their impact on antigenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Small p-value annotations and legend text are low resolution but do not affect the conclusion regarding absence of mutation data.",
