  "explanation": "A multipart figure showing geometric mean microneutralization (MN) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log2 scale) at baseline (Day 0), 1 month, and 6 months post\u2010vaccination for four influenza vaccine formulations (egg\u2010based Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4, cell\u2010based ccIIV4, and recombinant RIV4) across two age groups (18\u201344 and 45\u201364 years) and four influenza strains (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Individual data points, mean estimates, and statistical annotations are displayed. does not support the claim, as the figure presents immunogenicity data comparing antibody responses among vaccine types but contains no information on mutations arising during egg- or cell-based production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness. Note: No mention of production-related mutations or antigenic changes in the image. Limited to serologic titers.",
