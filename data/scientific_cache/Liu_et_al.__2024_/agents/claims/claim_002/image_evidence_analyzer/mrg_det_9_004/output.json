  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure (A\u2013D) showing ELISA antibody titers (log\u2082 scale) against hemagglutinin (HA) from egg-grown versus cell-grown influenza viruses for A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata strains, in subjects at Day 0 and 1 month after vaccination with various vaccine formulations; panel B shows geometric mean ratios of egg- to cell-derived HA titers; panels C and D show titers and fold-rise to the HA stalk domains. The figure presents immunogenicity data comparing antibody titers to egg- and cell-derived HA antigens but does not provide any data on the occurrence of production-related mutations or their impact on vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Text and annotations in the figure are small and specific mutation data are not shown; context of production process is not detailed.",
