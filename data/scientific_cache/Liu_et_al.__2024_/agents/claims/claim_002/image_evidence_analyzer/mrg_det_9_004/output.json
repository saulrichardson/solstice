  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure presenting ELISA-measured geometric mean titers (GMTs) and fold-rise of HA head (H3N2, pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) and HA stalk (H3 and H1) binding antibody responses at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination across seven repeat vaccination arms (various sequences of cell-based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4, and egg-based IIV4 vaccines). Individual titer dots and 95% CIs are shown, with statistical comparisons between vaccine groups. The figure reports immunogenicity (antibody titers and fold-rise) for different vaccine sequences but does not present any data on vaccine production-induced mutations or their impact on vaccine strain effectiveness; therefore it does not support the claim Note: Interpretation limited to what is shown; no production or mutation data are present in the figure",
