  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers against egg-derived and cell-derived hemagglutinin (HA) from influenza strains A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination. Different colored symbols represent groups receiving combinations of cell-based (ccIV4) and egg-based (IIV4/RIV4) vaccines. Panel A compares absolute titers on a log2 scale for egg versus cell virus HA. Panel B shows geometric mean ratios of egg to cell HA ELISA titers across HA subtypes. Panel C shows titers against the H3 and H1 stalk domains. Panel D shows fold-rise of stalk titers from Day 0 to 1 month. The figure presents serologic antibody titers and ratios but does not show or measure mutations arising during egg- or cell-based vaccine production. It therefore does not support the claim Note: Interpretation limited to what is visible; figure resolution may obscure small text details but no mutation data are apparent.",
