  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Multi-panel figure showing ELISA antibody titers (log2 scale) against influenza HA proteins derived from egg-grown versus cell-grown viruses (panel A), geometric mean ratios of egg versus cell HA ELISA titers (panel B), stalk-specific ELISA titers for H3 and H1 stalk antigens (panel C), and fold-rise in stalk ELISA titers post-vaccination (panel D) for various vaccine formulations (cell-culture quadrivalent, recombinant, egg-based inactivated, in different prime/boost combinations). The figure reports antibody binding titers to egg- versus cell-propagated HA antigens and stalk domains for different vaccine types but does not identify production-induced mutations nor directly link any observed titer differences to mutations acquired during egg or cell culture that reduce vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible serologic data; no sequence or mutation evidence is presented in the image.",
