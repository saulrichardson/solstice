  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A 4\u00d74 grid of box-and-whisker plots showing hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) titers (log2 scale) measured at Day 0 and one month post-vaccination in two age groups (18\u201344 yrs and 45\u201364 yrs) and using either egg-grown or cell-grown influenza viruses. Results are shown for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) with different vaccine regimens color-coded and selected p-values annotated above certain comparisons. The figure presents immunogenicity (HI titer) data for egg-based versus cell-based viruses but does not show any genetic or mechanistic evidence of mutations arising during vaccine production or directly link those mutations to reduced effectiveness. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Resolution of p-value annotations is limited, and the plots reflect antibody responses rather than direct measures of production-induced antigenic mutations.",
