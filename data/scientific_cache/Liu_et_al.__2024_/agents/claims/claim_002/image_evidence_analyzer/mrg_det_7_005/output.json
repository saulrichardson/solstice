  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-panel figure showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log\u2082 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination for two age groups (18\u201344 yrs, 45\u201364 yrs) and four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata), with separate panels for egg-virus and cell-virus measurements. Box and whisker plots compare six group pairings (different vaccine and assay virus combinations) with p-values for selected comparisons at 1 month. The figure presents immunogenicity (HI titer) comparisons between egg- and cell-based vaccine preparations but does not show or measure production-related mutations or their impact on vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Image annotations are small and group labels are not fully legible, but the overall data type and focus on antibody titers are clear.",
