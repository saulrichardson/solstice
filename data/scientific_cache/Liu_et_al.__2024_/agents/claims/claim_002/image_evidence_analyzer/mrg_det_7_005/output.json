  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "The image consists of multiple box-and-whisker plots showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log\u2082 scale) measured at Day 0 and 1 month post-vaccination for four influenza strains (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Data are stratified by seven repeat vaccination arms combining egg- and cell-propagated vaccines (e.g., cell\u2013cell, cell\u2013RIV4, RIV4\u2013cell, RIV4\u2013RIV4, IIV4\u2013cell, IIV4\u2013RIV4, IIV4\u2013IIV4). Geometric mean titers with 95% confidence intervals are shown, and significant differences (p-values) between responses to cell- versus egg-propagated antigens are annotated. The figure presents immunogenicity data comparing antibody responses to cell- versus egg-propagated vaccine viruses but provides no direct evidence of mutations arising during vaccine production. Thus, it does not support the claim. Note: No direct mutation or genetic sequencing data are shown; inference about production-related mutations is not directly evidenced in this figure.",
