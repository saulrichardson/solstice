  "explanation": "Sixteen box\u2010and\u2010whisker plots arranged in a 4\u00d74 grid showing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (log\u2082 scale) at Day 0 and 1 month (1 m) in two age cohorts (18\u201344 yrs and 45\u201364 yrs) vaccinated with either egg\u2010propagated (\u2018egg virus\u2019) or cell\u2010propagated (\u2018cell virus\u2019) influenza vaccines. Rows correspond to four influenza strains/subtypes (A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Within each plot, colored symbols represent HI titers against homologous and heterologous viruses (egg\u2010derived vs. cell\u2010derived), and horizontal bars with p-values indicate statistically significant differences in titers at 1 month between egg\u2010 and cell\u2010propagated viruses. Evidence: In recipients of egg\u2010based vaccines, HI titers against cell\u2010propagated A(H3N2) at 1 month are significantly lower (e.g., p<0.0001 in 18\u201344 yr group), indicating reduced antibody recognition of the cell\u2010grown strain. Similar significant differences are seen for other strains and age groups. The significant reductions in HI titers against cell\u2010propagated viruses in individuals vaccinated with egg\u2010propagated vaccines demonstrate that production method can alter antigenicity and reduce immune recognition, which supports the claim Note: The figure shows differential antibody responses rather than directly displaying mutation analyses; inference of mutations is indirect but consistent with known egg\u2010adaptation effects.",
