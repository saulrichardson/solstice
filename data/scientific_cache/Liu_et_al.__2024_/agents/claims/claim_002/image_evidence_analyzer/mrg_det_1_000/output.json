  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram depicting enrollment, randomization, and allocation of participants across two years (2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020) into three influenza vaccine groups: standard egg-based inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4), cell-culture based inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (ccIIV4), and recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV4). Numbers of participants re-enrolled, randomized, excluded, and allocated to each vaccine sequence are shown. The figure is a participant flowchart showing study enrollment and vaccine group allocation; it does not present any data or statements about mutations arising during production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image quality is sufficient to read all labels; however, the figure is limited to enrollment flow and contains no information on vaccine mutation or effectiveness outcomes.",
