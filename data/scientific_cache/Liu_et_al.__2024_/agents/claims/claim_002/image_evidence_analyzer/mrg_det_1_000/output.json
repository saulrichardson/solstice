  "explanation": "CONSORT flow diagram showing enrollment, randomization, and follow-up of participants in two influenza seasons (2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020) with allocation to four vaccine arms (cell-culture\u2013derived IIV4, recombinant HA influenza vaccine, egg-based Fluzone IIV4, and egg-based Fluarix IIV4), including participant numbers by age group and completion of visits. The diagram details trial enrollment and vaccine allocation but contains no information about mutations arising during production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness and therefore does not support the claim.",
