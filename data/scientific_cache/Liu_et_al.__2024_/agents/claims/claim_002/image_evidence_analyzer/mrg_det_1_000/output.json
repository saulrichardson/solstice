  "explanation": "A CONSORT flow diagram showing participant enrollment, randomization, and follow-up visits over two flu seasons (2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020) for four vaccine arms: cell culture\u2013based IIV4 (ccIIV4), recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4), and two egg-based IIV4 vaccines (Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4). It details numbers enrolled, age strata, completions at day 0, 1 month, and 6 months, and re-randomization in Year 2. The figure does not present any data or statements about mutations arising during vaccine production or their impact on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim.",
