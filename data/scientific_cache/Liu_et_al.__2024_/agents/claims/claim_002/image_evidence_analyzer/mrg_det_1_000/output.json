  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-year CONSORT flow diagram showing enrollment, randomization, and follow-up of participants in a clinical trial comparing four quadrivalent influenza vaccines (cell-culture\u2013based ccIIV4, recombinant RIV4, and two egg-based IIV4s) across Year 1 (2018\u20132019) and Year 2 (2019\u20132020). It details group sizes, age strata, re-randomizations, and protocol exclusions. The figure is solely a participant flowchart and contains no data or statements about mutations arising during vaccine production or any impact on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; no text regarding viral mutations, egg adaptation, or effectiveness was present.",
