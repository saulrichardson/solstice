  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing US-licensed influenza vaccines (2024\u201325) with columns for trade name (manufacturer), presentations, age indication, antigen content per dose, route, and thimerosal content. It includes entries for Fluad Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur), and FluMist Quadrivalent. The image presents a product listing and formulation table; it does not provide any data on clinical trial design or comparators, and thus does not support the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine). Note: Image quality is sufficient; table scope is formulation details only, with no clinical trial information.",
