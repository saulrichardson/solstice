  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing several licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines, showing for each the trade name (manufacturer), presentation, age indication, hemagglutinin content per dose, route of administration, and mercury content. The entries visible include Fluad Quadrivalent (IIV4), Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA vaccine, RIV4), and FluMist Quadrivalent (LAIV4). The image does not support the claim because it only catalogs vaccines and their formulations; it does not describe any pivotal trial or comparison of Flublok Quadrivalent versus Fluarix Quadrivalent. Note: The table snippet may be incomplete and does not show any trial data or mention of Fluarix Quadrivalent.",
