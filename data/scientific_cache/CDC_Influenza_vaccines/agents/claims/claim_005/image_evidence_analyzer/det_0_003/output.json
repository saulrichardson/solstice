  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table titled \"Influenza vaccines \u2014 United States, 2023\u201324 influenza season\" listing trade names of influenza vaccines (standard-dose egg-based IIV4, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, and high-dose HD-IIV4), their presentations, age indications, hemagglutinin content per dose, route of administration, and mercury content if present. The table merely lists vaccine products and their properties; it does not present any data or notes indicating that Flublok quadrivalent was compared to or evaluated against Fluarix quadrivalent in a pivotal trial, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Table portion shown does not include any RIV4 (recombinant) section or trial data; if additional sections exist, they are not visible here.",
