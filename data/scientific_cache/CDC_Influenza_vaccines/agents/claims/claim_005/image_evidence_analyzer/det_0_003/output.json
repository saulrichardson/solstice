  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza vaccines, including standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent vaccines (Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent), cell culture\u2013based quadrivalent vaccine (Flucelvax), high-dose egg-based quadrivalent vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose), with columns for presentations, age indication, HA content per dose, route, and thimerosal content. The table does not mention Flublok quadrivalent or any pivotal trial comparing it against Fluarix quadrivalent; therefore, it does not support the claim.
