  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table titled 'Influenza vaccines \u2014 United States, 2023\u201324 influenza season' listing trade names and manufacturers of influenza vaccines (egg-based standard-dose IIV4, cell culture\u2013based cccIV4, high-dose HD-IIV4), their presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe), age indications, hemagglutinin content per dose, route of administration, and thimerosal content. The table does not mention Flublok (quadrivalent) or any comparison against Fluarix (quadrivalent); it simply lists vaccine products and their specifications. This does not support the claim. Note: Only the visible portion of the table is shown; Flublok may appear elsewhere but is not present in the provided image.",
