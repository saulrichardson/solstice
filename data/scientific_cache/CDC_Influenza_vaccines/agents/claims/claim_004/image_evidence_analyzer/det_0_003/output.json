  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products (standard-dose egg-based IIV4, cell culture\u2013based IIV4, high-dose egg-based IIV4, live attenuated LAIV4), with columns for presentation (e.g., 0.5-mL PFS, 5.0-mL MDV, 0.7-mL PFS), age indication, antigen content per dose (\u00b5g per strain), administration route, and thimerosal content. The table provides vaccine formulations and dosages but contains no data on recombinant vaccines or comparative antibody responses; therefore it does not support the claim Note: Table shows only antigen doses and presentations, without immunogenicity or clinical outcome data",
