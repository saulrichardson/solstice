  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table titled 'Influenza vaccines \u2014 United States, 2023\u201324 influenza season' listing various influenza vaccine products by trade name and manufacturer, presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe, multi-dose vial), age indications, hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per dose, administration route, and mercury content. It categorizes vaccines into standard-dose egg-based (IIV4), cell culture\u2013based (ccIIV4), and high-dose egg-based (HD-IIV4) formulations. does not support the claim because the table provides only product names, formulations, and antigen quantities without any data on antibody response or direct comparison between higher-dose recombinant vaccines and egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: The image is clear and legible, but it contains no immunogenicity or clinical response data; it only enumerates vaccine formulations and doses.",
