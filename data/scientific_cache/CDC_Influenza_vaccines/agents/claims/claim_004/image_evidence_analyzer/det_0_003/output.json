  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table titled \"TABLE 1. Influenza vaccines \u2014 United States, 2023\u201324 influenza season\" listing vaccine trade names (egg-based standard-dose IIV4, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, and egg-based high-dose HD-IIV4), presentations (PFS, MDV, SDV), age indications, micrograms of hemagglutinin per dose for each virus component, route of administration, and thimerosal content. The table provides only vaccine formulations and antigen dose amounts; it does not present any immunogenicity or antibody response data comparing higher-dose recombinant vaccines to egg-based standard-dose vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to the visible portion of the table; image quality is sufficient but no immunogenicity results are shown.",
