  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",

  "explanation": "Table listing 2023\u201324 U.S. influenza vaccines by trade name, manufacturer, presentation format, age indication, hemagglutinin antigen (HA) microgram content per virus per dose, route of administration, and mercury content. Vaccines are grouped as standard-dose egg-based (IIV4), standard-dose cell culture\u2013based (ccIIV4), high-dose egg-based (HD-IIV4), adjuvanted recombinant (aRIV4), and recombinant (RIV4). The table provides HA antigen dose amounts (e.g., 45 \u00b5g per virus for recombinant RIV4 versus 15 \u00b5g for standard egg-based IIV4) but does not present any data on antibody responses or immunogenicity. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to composition and dosing information; no direct immunogenicity or clinical outcome data are shown.",
