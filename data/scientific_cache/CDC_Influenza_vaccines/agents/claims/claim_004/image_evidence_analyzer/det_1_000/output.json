  "claim_id": "claim_004",
  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine formulations, including trade name/manufacturer, presentation (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe), age indication, antigen content per dose (\u00b5g HA for IIV4s and RIV4, virus count for LAIV4), administration route, and presence of mercury. It shows Fluad Quadrivalent (egg-based IIV4) with 15 \u00b5g HA/strain, Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA RIV4) with 45 \u00b5g HA/strain, and FluMist Quadrivalent (egg-based LAIV4) with viral count units. Evidence: The table indicates that the recombinant RIV4 vaccine (Flublok) contains 45 \u00b5g HA per strain versus 15 \u00b5g HA per strain in the egg-based IIV4 vaccines. The image does not support the claim because it presents only antigen dosing data without any immunogenicity or antibody response results, so it doesn't support evidence that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine induces a more robust antibody response. Note: No immunogenicity or clinical outcome data are provided; the analysis is limited to the displayed table of vaccine formulations.",
