  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table listing influenza vaccines (trade name, manufacturer), presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe), age indications, HA content per dose (\u00b5g for inactivated vaccines), route of administration, and mercury content. Evidence: Shows recombinant HA vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) contains 45 \u00b5g HA per dose compared to 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL in egg-based standard-dose vaccines. does not support the claim: the table provides only HA dose comparisons and no antibody response data, so it doesn\u2019t show that a higher-dose recombinant vaccine induces a more robust antibody response. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody titer data are presented; only vaccine formulations and dosages are shown.",
