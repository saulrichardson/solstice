  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products by trade name (manufacturer), presentation, age indication, antigen content per dose (\u00b5g HA for inactivated vaccines or virus count for live attenuated), administration route, and mercury content. It includes Fluad Quadrivalent (egg-based standard-dose, 15 \u00b5g HA per strain, \u226565 yrs), Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA, 45 \u00b5g HA per strain, \u226518 yrs), and FluMist Quadrivalent (egg-based live attenuated intranasal). The table only reports vaccine formulations and antigen doses; it does not present any immunogenicity or antibody response data, so it does not support the claim. Note: No antibody titer or comparative immunogenicity data are shown; conclusions about immune responses cannot be drawn from this dosage table alone.",
