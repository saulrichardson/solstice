  "explanation": "A table titled 'TABLE 1. Influenza vaccines \u2014 United States, 2023\u201324 influenza season' listing vaccine trade names (egg-based IIV4, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, high-dose, adjuvanted, recombinant), presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL PFS, MDV), age indications, HA content per dose, administration route, and mercury content. The table provides formulation details and dosages for various influenza vaccines but contains no information on antigenic matching or confirmation that Flublok's antigens are identical to WHO- and FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Table excerpt may not show the full recombinant vaccine section, but no antigenic match details are present.",
