Influenza vaccines \u2014 United States, 2023\u201324 influenza season\u201d listing multiple influenza vaccines (egg-based standard-dose IIV4, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, high-dose IIV4, etc.) with columns for trade name/manufacturer, presentation, age indication, hemagglutinin (HA) micrograms per dose or virus count, route of administration, and mercury content. The table does not present any information about antigenic match between Flublok and WHO- or FDA-selected strains, so it does not support the claim.
