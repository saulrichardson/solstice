  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing trade names and manufacturers of quadrivalent influenza vaccines (Fluad Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent, FluMist Quadrivalent), their presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe or intranasal sprayer), age indications, hemagglutinin antigen content or virus count per dose, administration route, and presence of mercury. The table provides information on vaccine names, dosages, age indications, and administration routes but contains no information about antigenic matching or alignment with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Table is clear and legible; no relevant data on antigenic match is present.",
