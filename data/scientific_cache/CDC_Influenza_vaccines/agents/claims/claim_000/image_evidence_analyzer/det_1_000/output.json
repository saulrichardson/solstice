  "explanation": "Table listing licensed seasonal influenza vaccine products, including trade name (e.g., Flublok Quadrivalent), manufacturer, presentations, age indications, antigen content per dose (\u00b5g HA or virus count), route of administration, and mercury content. The table provides information on Flublok's formulation, dose, and age indication but makes no reference to how antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected viral strains is achieved or ensured. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to the visible portion of the table; no additional context on antigenic matching is provided in the image.",
