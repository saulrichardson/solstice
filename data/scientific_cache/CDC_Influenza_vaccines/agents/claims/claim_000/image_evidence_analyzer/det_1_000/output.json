  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",

  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza vaccines (e.g., Fluad Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent, FluMist Quadrivalent) with columns for presentation format, age indication, antigen content per dose (\u03bcg HA or virus units), administration route, and mercury content. The image does not support the claim because it only provides vaccine formulations, dosages, age indications, and routes of administration, without any information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains. Note: The table is clear and legible; no relevant data on antigenic match or strain selection is present.",
