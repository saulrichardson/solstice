      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok Quadrivalent contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL dose found in standard-dose flu vaccines, as also shown elsewhere in the document for other products. This directly supports the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim about greater immunogenicity; it only supports the antigen content comparison.",

The document lists: 'RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine)' and 'Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM', which matches the factual content of the quote.",
