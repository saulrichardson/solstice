      "explanation": "The quote provides explicit information that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL dose listed for standard-dose flu vaccines elsewhere in the document. This directly supports the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. However, the quote does not address immunogenicity, so it only supports the first part of the claim, not the entire claim.",

The relevant portion is: 'RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine)... (San of i Pasteur)... y \u00b5g', which, when cleaned, matches the quoted information about Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) by Sanofi Pasteur, its 0.5 mL dose, and 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL content.",

      "explanation": "The quote provides the specific HA content (15 \u00b5g per strain per 0.5 mL) for standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines. This directly supports the first part of the claim by establishing the baseline for comparison to Flublok's higher HA content. While the quote does not mention Flublok or immunogenicity, it does provide the necessary factual basis for the '3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content' portion of the claim, as Flublok is known to contain 45 \u00b5g per strain per 0.5 mL. Thus, the quote supports the claim as far as the HA content comparison is concerned.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote 'Standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus strain per 0.5 mL dose.' is semantically present in the document. Specifically, the document states multiple times that standard-dose flu vaccines (e.g., Fluzone Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent) are 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL, which matches the factual content of the quote.",
