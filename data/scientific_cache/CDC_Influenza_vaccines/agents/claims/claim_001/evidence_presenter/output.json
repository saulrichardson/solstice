  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "document": "CDC_Influenza_vaccines",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {
      "quote": "Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM",
      "explanation": "The quote provides explicit information that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL dose listed for standard-dose flu vaccines elsewhere in the document. This directly supports the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. However, the quote does not address immunogenicity, so it only supports the first part of the claim, not the entire claim."
    },
    {
      "quote": "Standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus strain per 0.5 mL dose.",
      "explanation": "The quote provides the specific HA content (15 \u00b5g per strain per 0.5 mL) for standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines. This directly supports the first part of the claim by establishing the baseline for comparison to Flublok's higher HA content. While the quote does not mention Flublok or immunogenicity, it does provide the necessary factual basis for the '3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content' portion of the claim, as Flublok is known to contain 45 \u00b5g per strain per 0.5 mL. Thus, the quote supports the claim as far as the HA content comparison is concerned."
