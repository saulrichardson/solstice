  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "document": "CDC_Influenza_vaccines",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {
      "quote": "Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) (recombinant HA vaccine) 0.5-mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM",
      "explanation": "The quote provides explicit information that Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL dose listed for standard-dose flu vaccines (e.g., Fluzone Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent) elsewhere in the document. Therefore, the quote directly supports the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. However, the quote does not address immunogenicity or its comparison to standard-dose vaccines, so it only supports the first part of the claim."
    },
    {
      "quote": "Standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per virus strain per 0.5 mL dose.",
      "explanation": "The quote provides the specific HA content (15 \u00b5g per strain per 0.5 mL) for standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines. This directly supports the first part of the claim by establishing the baseline for comparison to Flublok, which is known to contain 45 \u00b5g per strain per 0.5 mL (3x the standard dose). While the quote does not address immunogenicity or Flublok directly, it does provide the necessary factual basis for the claim about antigen content."
