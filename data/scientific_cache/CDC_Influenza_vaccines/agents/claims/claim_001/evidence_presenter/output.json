  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",

      "quote": "Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM",
      "explanation": "The quote 'Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM' is present in the document, though with minor OCR artifacts. The relevant portion is: 'y \u00b5g RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine)' and the context of the table lists other vaccines with their \u00b5g/0.5 mL content, such as 'Flu zone Quad rival ent (San of i Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS\u2020\u2020 \u22656 mos\u2020\u2020 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM'. The document clearly lists Flublok (RIV4) as having 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL, matching the quote's factual content.. The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by stating that Flublok contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose, which is three times the 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL found in standard-dose flu vaccines (as shown for other vaccines in the same table). However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity; it only supports the antigen content comparison. Based solely on the document, the quote supports the claim about HA content but not the immunogenicity aspect."

      "quote": "Standard-dose, egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per vaccine virus per 0.5 mL dose.",
      "explanation": "The quote's factual content appears in the document in several places, such as 'Flu zone Quad rival ent (San of i Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS\u2020\u2020 \u22656 mos\u2020\u2020 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM' and '( ) FluLaval Quad rival ent 0 5 mL PFS \u22656 mos 15 \u00b5g/0 5 mL'. These lines indicate that standard-dose, egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per 0.5 mL dose, which is semantically equivalent to the quote provided.. The quote establishes that standard-dose, egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This provides the necessary baseline for comparison to Flublok, which is claimed to contain 3x the HA antigen content. While the document does not mention Flublok or its HA content directly, the quote does support the part of the claim regarding the HA content of standard-dose vaccines, which is a required component for substantiating the overall claim."
