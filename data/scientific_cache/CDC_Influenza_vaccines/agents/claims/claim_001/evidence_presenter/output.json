  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "document": "CDC_Influenza_vaccines",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {
      "quote": "RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) Flublok Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok Quadrivalent contains 45 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL dose found in standard-dose flu vaccines, as also shown elsewhere in the document for other products. This directly supports the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim about greater immunogenicity; it only supports the antigen content comparison."

    {
      "quote": "Fluzone Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS \u22656 mos 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM",
      "explanation": "The quote provides the HA antigen content (15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL) for a standard-dose flu vaccine (Fluzone Quadrivalent). This allows direct comparison to Flublok's known 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL (though Flublok's content is not stated in this document), supporting the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines. The quote does not address immunogenicity, but it does substantiate the first part of the claim regarding antigen content."
