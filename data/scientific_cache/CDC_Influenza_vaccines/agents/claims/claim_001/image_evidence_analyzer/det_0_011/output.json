  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A black-and-white QR code occupying the entire image, with no visible text or clinical data. does not support the claim because the image contains only a QR code and presents no information about Flublok antigen content or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim Note: The image quality is clear but contains no readable clinical content. Without scanning the QR code, no evidence on HA content can be determined.",
