  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products with columns for trade name (manufacturer), presentation, age indication, hemagglutinin (HA) content per dose (\u00b5g/0.5 mL or virus count), route, and mercury content. It shows standard inactivated quadrivalent vaccines (IIV4s) containing 15 \u00b5g HA per strain and the recombinant HA vaccine Flublok Quadrivalent containing 45 \u00b5g HA per strain. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent is listed as containing 45 \u00b5g HA per 0.5 mL (per strain) versus 15 \u00b5g per 0.5 mL for standard-dose vaccines. The table clearly shows Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines but does not include any data or statements about immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim's assertion of greater immunogenicity. Note: No immunogenicity or clinical outcome data are provided in the image; content data are clear and legible.",
