  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products, including trade name, presentation, age indication, \u00b5g HA per 0.5 mL dose for each vaccine virus, and route of administration. It shows standard IIV4 vaccines (e.g., Fluad Quadrivalent) with 15 \u00b5g HA per virus per dose and the recombinant HA vaccine Flublok Quadrivalent with 45 \u00b5g HA per virus per dose. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent is listed as containing 45 \u00b5g HA per 0.5 mL dose versus 15 \u00b5g HA per dose for standard-dose vaccines. The table clearly shows Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content compared to standard-dose flu vaccines but provides no data or statements linking this higher content to greater immunogenicity, so the evidence does not support the claim fully. Note: Image appears clear and complete for the compositional data but contains no immunogenicity outcomes.",
