  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing U.S. influenza vaccines for the 2023\u201324 season, showing trade names (e.g., Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent), presentation formats, age indications, HA antigen content per dose for each vaccine virus (e.g., 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL for standard-dose, 60 \u00b5g/0.7 mL for high-dose), administration route, and mercury content if present. does not support the claim because the table does not include any information on Flublok or its HA antigen content, and thus provides no evidence of a 3\u00d7 antigen content for Flublok Note: The portion of the table shown does not include Flublok or any recombinant influenza vaccine entries, so antigen content for Flublok cannot be determined from this image",
