  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccines for the 2023\u201324 US season, showing trade names, presentations, age indications, micrograms of hemagglutinin (HA) per dose for IIV4 (standard-dose egg-based), ccIIV4 (cell culture\u2013based), and HD-IIV4 (high-dose egg-based) vaccines, routes of administration, and mercury content. The portion shown does not include the recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) section. The image does not display Flublok or the HA content for RIV4 vaccines, so it does not support the claim Note: The table is cut off before the RIV4 (recombinant) section, so the relevant data for Flublok are not visible",
