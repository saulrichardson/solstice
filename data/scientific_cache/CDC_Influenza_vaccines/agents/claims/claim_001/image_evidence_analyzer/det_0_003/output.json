  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table listing 2023\u201324 U.S. influenza vaccines by trade name, presentation, age indication, \u00b5g hemagglutinin per strain per dose, route, and mercury content. Includes standard-dose egg-based IIV4, cell-culture IIV4, and high-dose IIV4 entries (e.g., Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent at 60 \u00b5g/0.7 mL). The table does not include any entry for Flublok or show a 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL HA content per strain; it only shows standard 15 \u00b5g doses and a 60 \u00b5g high-dose vaccine. Therefore, it does not support the claim Note: Visible portion of the table is cut off before any recombinant vaccine (RIV4) entries; immunogenicity data are not presented",
