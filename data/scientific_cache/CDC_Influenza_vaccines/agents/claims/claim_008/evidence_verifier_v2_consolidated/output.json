The quote directly states that the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok) contains 45 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, as compared to the standard-dose influenza vaccine, which is also shown in the document as containing 15 mcg of HA per strain. The quote provides explicit, numerical support for the claim.",
