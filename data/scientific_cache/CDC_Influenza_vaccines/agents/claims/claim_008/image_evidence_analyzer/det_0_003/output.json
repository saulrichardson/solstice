  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various standard-dose egg-based and cell culture-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4) and one high-dose egg-based quadrivalent IIV4, showing presentations, age indications, haemagglutinin antigen content per strain (usually 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL for standard-dose and 60 \u00b5g/0.7 mL for high-dose), routes, and thimerosal content. The table only presents HA content for IIV4 products (15 \u00b5g per strain for standard-dose IIV4 and 60 \u00b5g per strain for high-dose IIV4) and does not include Flublok or its 45 \u00b5g per strain formulation, so it does not support the claim Note: Image only shows IIV4 formulations; Flublok (RIV4) is not listed, so antigen content for recombinant vaccine cannot be confirmed from this image.",
