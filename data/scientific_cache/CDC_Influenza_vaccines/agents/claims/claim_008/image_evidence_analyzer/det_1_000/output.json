  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": true,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products by trade name and manufacturer, presentation, age indication, HA content per dose (\u03bcg HA per strain or virus count for LAIV4), administration route, and presence of mercury. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA vaccine) is listed as containing 45 \u03bcg/0.5 mL HA per strain, whereas Fluad Quadrivalent (an IIV4) is listed as containing 15 \u03bcg/0.5 mL HA per strain. The table explicitly shows Flublok contains 45 \u03bcg HA per strain versus 15 \u03bcg HA per strain in a standard-dose IIV4, which supports the claim",
