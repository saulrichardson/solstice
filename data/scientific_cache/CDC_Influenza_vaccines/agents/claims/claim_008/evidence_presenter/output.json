  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",

    {
      "quote": "RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) 0.5-mL PFS \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok) contains 45 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This matches the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, and the document also lists standard-dose vaccines as containing 15 mcg of HA per strain. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim."

      "explanation": "The quote directly states that the standard-dose influenza vaccine (Fluzone Quadrivalent) contains 15 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This supports the claim by providing the specific HA content for a standard-dose influenza vaccine, which is necessary for comparison with Flublok's HA content as described in the claim."

      "quote": "FluLaval Quadrivalent 0.5 mL PFS \u22656 mos 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL",
      "explanation": "The quote provides explicit information that a standard-dose influenza vaccine (FluLaval Quadrivalent) contains 15 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This directly supports the part of the claim stating that standard-dose influenza vaccines contain 15 mcg of HA per strain. While the quote does not mention Flublok or its HA content, it does substantiate the comparison point for standard-dose vaccines as stated in the claim."

Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA vaccine) is listed as containing 45 \u03bcg/0.5 mL HA per strain, whereas Fluad Quadrivalent (an IIV4) is listed as containing 15 \u03bcg/0.5 mL HA per strain. The table explicitly shows Flublok contains 45 \u03bcg HA per strain versus 15 \u03bcg HA per strain in a standard-dose IIV4, which supports the claim"
