      "explanation": "The quote directly states that the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok) contains 45 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This matches the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, and the document also lists standard-dose vaccines as containing 15 mcg of HA per strain. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.",

The relevant portion is: 'y \u00b5g RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine)'. The context and numbers (45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL) are preserved, and the product is identified as RIV4, which is Flublok.",
