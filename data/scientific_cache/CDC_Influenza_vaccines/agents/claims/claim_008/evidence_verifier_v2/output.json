      "explanation": "The quote 'RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) 0.5-mL SDV \u226518 yrs 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM' is present in the document, though it appears with some minor OCR artifacts. The key facts\u2014RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine), 0.5-mL single-dose vial, for ages \u226518 years, and 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL administered intramuscularly\u2014are all present and semantically equivalent to the quote provided.. The quote directly states that the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok) contains 45 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, as compared to the standard-dose influenza vaccine, which is also shown in the document as containing 15 mcg of HA per strain. The quote provides explicit, numerical support for the claim.",

The quote directly states that the standard-dose influenza vaccine (Fluzone Quadrivalent) contains 15 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This fact is necessary to support the claim's comparison between Flublok (45 mcg HA/strain) and standard-dose vaccines (15 mcg HA/strain). While the quote does not mention Flublok, it provides the standard-dose value, which is a required part of the claim.",
