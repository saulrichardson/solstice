      "explanation": "The quote directly states that the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok) contains 45 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, as compared to the standard-dose influenza vaccine, which is also listed in the document as containing 15 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote 'RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL' appears in the document in the section listing vaccine types and their HA content. The document explicitly lists 'RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine) 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL', which is semantically equivalent to the quote provided.",
      "support_explanation": "The quote directly states that the recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4, which is Flublok) contains 45 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose. This directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, as compared to the standard-dose influenza vaccine, which is also listed in the document as containing 15 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim.",
      "original_relevance": "This quote explicitly states that the recombinant HA vaccine (Flublok) contains 45 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose, directly supporting the claim about Flublok's HA content per strain."

      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that the standard-dose influenza vaccine (Fluzone Quadrivalent) contains 15 micrograms of HA per 0.5 mL dose per strain. This supports the claim by providing the specific HA content for the standard-dose vaccine, which is necessary for the comparison to Flublok's 45 mcg per strain. While the quote does not mention Flublok, it provides the standard-dose value required for the claim.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote 'Flu zone Quad rival ent (Sanofi Pasteur) 0.5-mL PFS \u22656 mos 15 \u00b5g/0.5 mL IM' appears in the document, though with minor OCR artifacts (e.g., 'Quad rival ent' instead of 'Quadrivalent', 'San of i' instead of 'Sanofi'). The factual content\u2014product name, dose, age, and HA content per 0.5 mL\u2014is preserved.",
