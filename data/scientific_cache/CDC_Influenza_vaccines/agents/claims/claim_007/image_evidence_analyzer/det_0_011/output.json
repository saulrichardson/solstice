  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A black and white QR code occupying the frame, with no visible text, tables, or graphical data aside from the QR code itself. does not support the claim: the image is merely a QR code and provides no data or information regarding recombinant HA antigens, BEVS, or antibody responses compared with egg-derived vaccines. Note: The image is a QR code only; its embedded content could not be assessed visually, and no clinical data are directly visible.",
