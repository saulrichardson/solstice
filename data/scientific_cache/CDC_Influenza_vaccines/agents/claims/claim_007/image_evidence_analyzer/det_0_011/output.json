  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A schematic timeline and description of influenza vaccine production platforms, including egg-based split virus vaccines, cell culture-based vaccines, recombinant HA protein produced using the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) in insect cells (e.g., Flublok), and next-generation platforms. The figure outlines antigen source, manufacturing steps (culture, inactivation, purification, potency assays), HA content quantification methods, strain selection to formulation workflows, and notes on production yields. The figure provides a high-level overview of manufacturing processes for egg-derived, cell-culture, and BEVS recombinant HA vaccines but does not include any immunogenicity data or direct comparison of antibody responses. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but contains no immunological results or data on cross-reactive antibody levels.",
