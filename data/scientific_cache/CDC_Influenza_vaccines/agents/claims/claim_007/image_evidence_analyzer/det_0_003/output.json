  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-column table listing 2023\u201324 U.S. influenza vaccine products by trade name (manufacturer), presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe, multi-dose vial), age indications, antigen content per dose (\u00b5g HA), route of administration, and mercury content if present. The table provides only product names, formulations, dosages, and routes; it does not present any immunogenicity data or comparative antibody responses. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to basic vaccine product information; no data on antibody levels or cross-reactivity are shown.",
