  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-column table listing various seasonal influenza vaccine products, including vaccine name/manufacturer, presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe, 5.0-mL multidose vial), age indications (e.g., \u22656 months, \u226565 years), antigen content per dose (\u03bcg of hemagglutinin per strain), route of administration (IM), and thimerosal content (if present). The table only provides dosing and presentation details of egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose, and adjuvanted influenza vaccines and does not present any immunogenicity or antibody response data comparing BEVS-derived recombinant HA antigens with egg-derived vaccines, and thus does not support the claim.",
