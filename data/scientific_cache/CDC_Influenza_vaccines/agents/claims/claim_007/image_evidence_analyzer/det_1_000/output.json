  "explanation": "A table listing licensed seasonal influenza vaccines, including trade names, presentations (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe), age indications, hemagglutinin (HA) antigen or virus content per dose, administration route, and mercury content. Vaccines shown include Fluz Quadrivalent (egg-based IIV4), Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA vaccine, RIV4, 45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL), and FluMist Quadrivalent (egg-based LAIV4). The table provides only formulation, dosage, and route information; it does not present any immunogenicity or antibody cross-reactivity data and therefore does not support the claim Note: No data on antibody responses or comparative immunogenicity are shown in this table",
