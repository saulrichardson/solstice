  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products (trade name and manufacturer), presentations, age indications, hemagglutinin content per dose (\u00b5g HA or virus count), route of administration, and thimerosal-derived mercury content. Products include an adjuvanted egg-based vaccine (Fluad Quadrivalent), a recombinant HA vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent), and a live attenuated intranasal vaccine (FluMist Quadrivalent). The image provides formulation and licensing details of various influenza vaccines but contains no immunogenicity or cross-protection data; it does not support the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response or cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: No data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or mismatch season performance are presented; analysis is limited to the visible vaccine composition and administration details.",
