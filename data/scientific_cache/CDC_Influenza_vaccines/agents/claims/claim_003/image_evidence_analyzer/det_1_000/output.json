  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products by trade name (including Flublok Quadrivalent recombinant HA vaccine), their presentations, age indications, antigen content per dose, administration route, and mercury (thimerosal) content. The table provides product specifications (dose, age indication, route) but includes no data on immune response breadth or cross-protection in mismatch seasons, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and fully legible; however, it contains only descriptive vaccine characteristics without immunogenicity or efficacy data.",
