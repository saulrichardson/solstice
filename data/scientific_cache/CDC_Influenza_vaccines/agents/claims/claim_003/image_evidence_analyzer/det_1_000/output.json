  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products (IIV4, RIV4, LAIV4) with columns for trade name and manufacturer, presentation format, age indication, micrograms of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen or virus count per dose, route of administration, and mercury content. The table provides only product names, dosages, age indications, and formulation details and does not present any data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or performance in mismatch seasons, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible; however, it contains only vaccine specifications without immunogenicity or efficacy data.",
