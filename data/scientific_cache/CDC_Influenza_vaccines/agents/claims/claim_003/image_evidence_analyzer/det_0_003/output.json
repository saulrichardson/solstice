  "explanation": "A table titled \"Influenza vaccines \u2014 United States, 2023\u201324 influenza season\" listing vaccine trade names and manufacturers, presentation formats (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe, multidose vial), age indications, antigen content (\u00b5g hemagglutinin per dose), administration route, and mercury content. The table is organized by vaccine type: IIV4 (egg-based), ccIIV4 (cell culture\u2013based), HD-IIV4 (high-dose egg-based), aIIV4 (adjuvanted egg-based), RIV4 (recombinant), and LAIV4 (live-attenuated). does not support the claim: the table provides formulation and dosing information for various influenza vaccines, including the recombinant vaccine, but contains no data on immune response breadth or cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: Image quality is sufficient; however, no immunogenicity or cross-protection data are presented.",
