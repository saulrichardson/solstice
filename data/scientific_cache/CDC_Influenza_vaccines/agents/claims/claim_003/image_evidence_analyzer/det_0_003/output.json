  "explanation": "A table listing licensed influenza vaccine products by trade name and manufacturer, presentation (e.g., 0.5-mL prefilled syringe, multi-dose vial), age indications, antigen content per dose (\u00b5g of HA per virus strain), administration route (intramuscular), and thimerosal content if present. Vaccines include standard-dose egg-based (e.g., Fluarix, Fluzone), cell culture-based (Flucelvax), high-dose egg-based (Fluzone High-Dose), and others. This table only provides product formulations and dosing information and does not present any data on immune response breadth or cross-protection in mismatch seasons; it does not support the claim. Note: Table is clear but contains no immunogenicity or efficacy data related to recombinant technology or cross-protection.",
