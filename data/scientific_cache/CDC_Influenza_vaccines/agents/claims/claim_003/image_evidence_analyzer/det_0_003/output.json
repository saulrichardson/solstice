  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza vaccines for the 2023\u201324 U.S. season, including trade names, manufacturers, presentations, age indications, hemagglutinin (HA) content per dose, administration route, and mercury content, organized by vaccine type (egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose, adjuvanted, and recombinant). The table provides formulation and dosage details for recombinant and other influenza vaccines but contains no data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or mismatch season effectiveness and thus does not support the claim. Note: Table shows only product specifications; lacks immunogenicity, efficacy, or cross-protection outcomes.",
