      "explanation": "Figure with four panels. Panel A illustrates the manufacturing process: three recombinant baculovirus expression vectors (rBEVs), each with a distinct hemagglutinin (HA) gene (H3, H1, or B), infect Sf9 insect cells, express HA protein, which is then purified and combined into a trivalent vaccine. Panel B shows vials of the recombinant subunit influenza vaccine. Panels C and D show bar charts of reactogenicity in veteran and older adult populations, respectively. Evidence: Panel A explicitly states that recombinant HA is expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system. Panel A directly describes the use of BEVS in insect cells to produce recombinant HA for Flublok, which supports the claim.",
