  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table titled \u201cInfluenza vaccines \u2014 United States, 2023\u201324 influenza season\u201d listing various influenza vaccine products (IIV4 standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based ccIIV4, and high-dose HD-IIV4), with columns for trade name/manufacturer, presentations, age indication, micrograms of hemagglutinin per dose, route of administration, and mercury content. Only egg-based and cell culture\u2013based inactivated vaccines and high-dose formulations are shown in the visible portion. The visible table does not mention Flublok or describe a recombinant HA expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system, so it does not support the claim. Note: Only the first portion of the table is visible; Flublok may appear elsewhere but is not shown in this image.",
