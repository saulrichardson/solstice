  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table listing influenza vaccines for the United States 2023\u201324 season, including trade name, manufacturer, presentation formats, age indications, HA content per dose, administration route, and mercury content for egg-based standard-dose, cell culture\u2013based, and high-dose vaccines. The table does not mention Flublok or describe any production platform involving recombinant HA expression in insect cells via a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The visible portion of the table does not include Flublok; if the full table extends beyond the shown rows it might include additional entries, but based on the provided image no relevant production details are present.",
