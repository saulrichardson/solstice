  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",

  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza vaccines by trade name and manufacturer, presentation (e.g., 0.5-mL PFS, 5.0-mL MDV), age indication, HA antigen content per dose, route of administration, and thimerosal content. Vaccine categories include standard-dose egg-based, cell culture\u2013based, and high-dose egg-based formulations. The table does not mention Flublok, recombinant HA production, insect cells, or a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim Note: Image shows only parts of an ACIP vaccine table; resolution and cropping may limit visibility of some entries, but no BEVS information is visible.",
