  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing licensed influenza vaccines with columns for trade name (manufacturer), presentation, age indication, HA content per dose, route, and mercury content. It includes entries for Fluad Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent (listed under \u201cRIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine)\u201d), and FluMist Quadrivalent. Evidence: Flublok Quadrivalent is labeled as a recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4). The table shows that Flublok is classified as a recombinant HA vaccine, but it does not provide any information about its production platform, insect cell expression, or use of a baculovirus expression vector system, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table text is clear but lacks details on expression system or production technology.",
