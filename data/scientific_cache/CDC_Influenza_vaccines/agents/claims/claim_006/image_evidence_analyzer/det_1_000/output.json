  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing various influenza vaccines, including trade name (e.g., Flublok Quadrivalent), presentations (0.5-mL prefilled syringe), age indications (\u226518 years), HA content per dose (45 \u00b5g/0.5 mL for Flublok), route of administration (intramuscular), and mercury content (if present). The table identifies Flublok Quadrivalent as a recombinant HA vaccine (RIV4) but does not provide any information on production in insect cells or use of a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear, but it lacks manufacturing method details; confidence is high that no BEVS information is present.",
