  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products (standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent, cell culture\u2013based, high-dose egg-based, adjuvanted), including brand names, presentations (0.5 mL PFS, MDV), age indications, antigen content per dose, route of administration, and thimerosal content. The table only provides vaccine formulations, dosages, and packaging details and does not mention mutations arising during production or their impact on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image quality is sufficient to see table contents; no relevant information about production mutations is present.",
