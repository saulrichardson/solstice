  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular listing of influenza vaccines available in the United States for the 2023\u201324 season, showing trade names, manufacturers, presentations (e.g., prefilled syringe, multi-dose vial), age indications, hemagglutinin content per dose, route of administration, and mercury content from thimerosal if present. The table only describes vaccine formulations, dosages, age indications, and formulation types (egg-based, cell culture-based, high-dose, adjuvanted, recombinant) but contains no information on production\u2010related mutations or effects on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to read all table entries; however, no data on mutation rates or clinical effectiveness are presented.",
