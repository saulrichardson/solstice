  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table titled 'Influenza vaccines \u2014 United States, 2023\u201324 influenza season' listing various influenza vaccine products by trade name and manufacturer, presentation volume, age indication, hemagglutinin (HA) content per dose, route of administration, and mercury content. The table is organized into sections: IIV4 (standard-dose, egg-based vaccines), ccIIV4 (standard-dose, cell culture\u2013based vaccine), HD-IIV4 (high-dose, egg-based vaccine), aIIV4 (adjuvanted, egg-based vaccine), and RIV4 (recombinant HA vaccine). The image only provides details on vaccine formulations, dosages, and routes of administration and does not mention mutations arising during production or impacts on vaccine effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The table does not include any information on production processes or mutation rates; evidence for the claim is not present in the visible content.",
