  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A schematic comparison of cell-based and egg-based influenza vaccine production processes. The left panel shows cell-based production: a cell line icon feeding into whole-virus reactors, followed by harvest, inactivation, fractional purification, and final fill. The right panel shows egg-based production: hen\u2019s eggs inoculated with high-growth reassortant virus, incubation (with periodic chilling), harvest of allantoic fluid, and then inactivation, purification, and final fill. An arrow labeled \u201cegg adaptation mutations\u201d is shown in the egg-based pathway. Evidence: The egg-based pathway includes a note on \u201cegg adaptation mutations.\u201d The figure highlights that egg-based vaccine production can introduce egg-adaptation mutations but does not show analogous mutations in the cell-based process, so it does not support the claim that both cell- and egg-based vaccines develop production mutations. Note: The image is clear but only outlines egg-based mutations; no mention of cell-based mutations is present.",
