  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines by trade name (e.g., Fluzone Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent, FluMist Quadrivalent), their presentations (dose volume and format), age indications, antigen content per dose, administration route, and mercury content if applicable, with abbreviations for IIV4, RIV4, and LAIV4. The table only provides information on vaccine types, dosages, age indications, and routes of administration; it does not mention mutations during production or any impact on vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim.",
