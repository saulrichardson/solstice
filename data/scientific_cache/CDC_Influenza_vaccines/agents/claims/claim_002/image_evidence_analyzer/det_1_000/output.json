  "explanation": "A table listing influenza vaccine products by trade name and manufacturer (including Seqirus Fluad Quadrivalent, Sanofi Pasteur Flublok Quadrivalent, and AstraZeneca FluMist Quadrivalent), with columns for presentations (dose volume and format), age indications, antigen content (\u00b5g HA per dose or virus count for LAIV4), administration route, and mercury content. The table provides basic formulation and presentation details for various cell-based, recombinant, and egg-based influenza vaccines but does not mention any potential for mutations during production or effects on vaccine effectiveness, and thus does not support the claim.
