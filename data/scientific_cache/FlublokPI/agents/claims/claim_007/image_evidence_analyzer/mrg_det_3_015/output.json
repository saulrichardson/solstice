  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing vaccine presentation details (Single-Dose Prefilled Syringe), its carton and component NDC numbers, followed by storage and handling instructions (temperature range, do not freeze, protect from light, expiration) and a heading for patient counseling information. The table provides only NDC numbers, packaging, and storage/handling instructions; it contains no data on antibody responses or comparisons between BEVS-derived and egg-derived vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity or clinical data are present; only logistical information is shown.",
