  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Page 1 of full prescribing information for Flublok, showing a table of contents listing sections such as Indications and Usage, Dosage and Administration, Dosage Forms and Strengths, Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions, Adverse Reactions, Use in Specific Populations, Description, Clinical Pharmacology, Nonclinical Toxicology, Clinical Studies, References, How Supplied/Storage and Handling, and Patient Counseling Information, along with the beginning of the Indications and Usage, Dosage and Administration, and Adverse Reactions text. The image contains prescribing information and does not present any immunogenicity data comparing broadly cross-reactive antibody levels induced by BEVS-derived recombinant HA versus egg-derived vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited to the visible table of contents and introductory prescribing text; no immunogenicity or comparative antibody data are present.",
