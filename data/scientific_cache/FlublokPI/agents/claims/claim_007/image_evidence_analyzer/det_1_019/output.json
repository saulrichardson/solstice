  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A comparative table listing percentages of solicited local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events for Flublok (N=972) and IIV3 (N=967), with columns for any, moderate, and severe events. The table presents safety/reactogenicity data only and contains no information on antibody levels, cross-reactivity, or immunogenicity of recombinant HA versus egg-derived vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible data; no immunogenicity or antibody titer information is present in the image.",
