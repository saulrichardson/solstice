  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing percentages of solicited local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events of two influenza vaccines: Flublok (BEVS-produced recombinant HA) and IIV3 (egg-derived), listing any, moderate, and severe events. does not support the claim because the table only presents safety/adverse event data and contains no immunogenicity or antibody cross-reactivity measurements",
