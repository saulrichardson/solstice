  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing percentages of solicited adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, swelling, systemic symptoms) by severity (any, moderate, severe) for study vaccines, with footnotes about subject reporting and study registration. The table presents safety data (incidence of adverse events) and contains no information on antibody responses or comparisons of broadly cross-reactive antibodies induced by BEVS-derived versus egg-derived HA antigens, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The table appears complete for safety outcomes; no immunogenicity or antibody titer data are shown.",
