  "explanation": "A table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a comparator vaccine (N=4301) on clinical endpoints: numbers of rtPCR-confirmed influenza cases (overall, influenza A, influenza B) and culture-confirmed protocol-defined ILI, with attack rates, relative risks, and relative vaccine efficacy percentages (with 95% CIs). does not support the claim: the table presents clinical efficacy data (attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy) for Flublok versus a comparator, but contains no information on levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies or immune responses against conserved HA regions. Note: Limited to what is visible: no immunogenicity or antibody cross-reactivity data are shown in this figure.",
