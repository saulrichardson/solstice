  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table comparing clinical efficacy outcomes between Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant HA, N=4303) and an egg-derived comparator (N=4301), showing number of cases, attack rates (%), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) for rtPCR-positive influenza A, B and culture-confirmed ILI. The table presents clinical attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy but does not report antibody levels, cross-reactivity, or responses to conserved HA regions, so it does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody data are shown; conclusions about broadly cross-reactive antibodies cannot be drawn from these efficacy endpoints.",
