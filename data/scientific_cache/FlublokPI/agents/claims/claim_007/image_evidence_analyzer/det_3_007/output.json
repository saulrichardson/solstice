  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A table showing attack rates (n/N), attack rate percentages, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals for different influenza strains, comparing a study vaccine versus a U.S.-licensed egg-derived quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Fluarix). The table provides clinical efficacy data (attack rates, RR, rVE) comparing recombinant and egg-derived vaccines but does not present any data on antibody levels, cross-reactivity, or responses to conserved HA regions, and thus does not support the claim. Note: None",
