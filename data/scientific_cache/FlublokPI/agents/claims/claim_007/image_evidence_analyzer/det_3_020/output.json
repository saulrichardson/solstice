  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing results from a study in adults aged 18\u201349 years, comparing Flublok vaccine (recombinant HA) versus saline placebo. It lists case definitions (positive culture with matched strains or any strain, ILI criteria), number and percentage of cases in each group, calculated vaccine efficacy percentages, and 95% confidence intervals for each comparison. does not support the claim because the table presents clinical efficacy outcomes rather than measurements of antibody levels or cross-reactivity against conserved HA regions, and does not compare BEVS-derived antigens to egg-derived vaccines.",
