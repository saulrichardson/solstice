  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A table presenting vaccine efficacy results (attack rates, relative risks, efficacy percentages with 95% CIs) for a recombinant HA vaccine (Flublok) versus placebo, broken down by PCR\u2010confirmed influenza\u2010like illness endpoints and influenza strain/subtype. does not support the claim because the image shows clinical efficacy data rather than measurements of broadly cross-reactive antibody levels against conserved HA regions and contains no comparison with egg-derived vaccines",
