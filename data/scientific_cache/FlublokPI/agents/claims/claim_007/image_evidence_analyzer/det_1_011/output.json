  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A table comparing local and systemic adverse events (%) between Flublok (recombinant HA vaccine) and placebo groups, listing rates of pain, redness, swelling, bruising, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, and fever. does not support the claim: the table presents safety and reactogenicity data for Flublok versus placebo and contains no information on antibody responses, cross-reactivity, or conserved HA regions. Note: The image is clear but only includes adverse event data, not immunogenicity or antibody assays.",
