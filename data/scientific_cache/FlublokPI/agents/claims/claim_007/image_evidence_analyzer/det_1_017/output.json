  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (%) for Flublok (a recombinant HA vaccine produced using BEVS) and IIV3 (an egg-derived inactivated influenza vaccine), listing pain, redness, firmness/swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, and fever with percentages of any, moderate, and severe events for each vaccine group. The table only presents safety and reactogenicity data and contains no information on antibody levels, cross-reactivity, or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim. Note: Only adverse event data is shown; immunogenicity or antibody response data are not available in the image.",
