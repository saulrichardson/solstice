  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing the percentage of subjects reporting severe adverse responses across multiple study groups, with footnotes defining severity grades and describing study registration and population. The table reports only safety data (severe adverse responses) and contains no information on antibody levels, cross-reactivity, HA regions, or comparisons between BEVS-derived and egg-derived vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody data are visible; the content is limited to adverse event severity.",
