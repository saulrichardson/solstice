  "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table presenting percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse events of Flublok (recombinant HA) versus IIV3 (egg-derived influenza vaccine) in respective study populations. The table reports safety/reactogenicity data and does not provide any information on antibody levels or cross-reactivity, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table is clear and legible; limitation is that it addresses adverse events, not immunogenicity.",
