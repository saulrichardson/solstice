      "relevance_explanation": "This reference is cited in the document and describes a randomized controlled trial specifically evaluating the immunogenicity of a baculovirus-expressed (i.e., BEVS-produced) hemagglutinin influenza vaccine, which directly relates to the claim about recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS. The context of its inclusion in the references section supports the claim that such vaccines have been studied for their immunogenicity, which includes the induction of broadly cross-reactive antibodies."

      "relevance_explanation": "This reference is cited in the document and describes a comparative study of the immunogenicity of recombinant HA (rHA, produced using BEVS) and traditional egg-derived trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIVs) in older adults. The direct comparison of immunogenicity between BEVS-produced and egg-derived vaccines is central to the claim."
