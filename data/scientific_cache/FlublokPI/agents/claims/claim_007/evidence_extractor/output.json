      "relevance_explanation": "This reference is cited in the context of clinical studies supporting the immunogenicity of recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS (baculovirus expression vector system), which is the technology used for Flublok. The study directly compares the immune response induced by the BEVS-produced vaccine to traditional vaccines, supporting the claim."
