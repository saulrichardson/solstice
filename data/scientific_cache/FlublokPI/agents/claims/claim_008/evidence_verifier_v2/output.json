The wording and factual content are semantically equivalent to the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, punctuation). All numbers and strain names match.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain for each of the three influenza virus strains, for a total of 135 mcg per 0.5 mL dose. This explicitly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, which is three times the 15 mcg per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine (as referenced in the claim, though the standard-dose value is not stated in this quote, the Flublok value is directly confirmed).",
