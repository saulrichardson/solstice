  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "document": "FlublokPI",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {
      "quote": "For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain for each of the three influenza virus strains, which matches the claim. While the quote does not mention the standard-dose influenza vaccine's HA content (15 mcg per strain), it fully substantiates the part of the claim about Flublok's HA content. The document does not contradict or undermine the claim, and the quote is explicit and direct."

      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes. Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain for each of the three influenza virus strains, totaling 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose. This is in contrast to the standard-dose influenza vaccine, which is commonly known to contain 15 mcg of HA per strain (though the document does not state the standard-dose value, it does confirm the Flublok value as claimed). Therefore, the quote provides direct factual support for the part of the claim regarding Flublok's HA content per strain."
