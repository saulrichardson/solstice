  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing percentages of local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, headache, fatigue) following vaccination with Flublok (N=972) versus IIV3 (N=967). Columns list rates of any, moderate, and severe events for each vaccine. The table shows adverse event rates for Flublok and IIV3 and does not present any information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain, so it does not support the claim Note: The image is clear and legible, but it contains no dosage or HA content data",
