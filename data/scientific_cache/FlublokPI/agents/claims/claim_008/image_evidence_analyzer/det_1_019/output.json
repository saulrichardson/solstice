  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing percentages of solicited adverse events (any, moderate, severe) reported by subjects across different studies and vaccine groups, with footnotes explaining reporting thresholds and study design. The table reports adverse event rates and does not include any information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain, so it does not support the claim about Flublok antigen dosing. Note: The image is legible but contains only safety data; no antigen dose information is present.",
