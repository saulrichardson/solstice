  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing percentages of solicited local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events graded as any, moderate, or severe in adults who received Flublok (N=972) versus IIV3 (standard-dose influenza vaccine, N=967). The table presents safety data on adverse event rates and does not include any information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but contains no data on antigen dosage.",
