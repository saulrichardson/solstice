  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse events in two groups: Flublok (N=1078) and IIV3 (N=1081), with columns for any, moderate, and severe events. The table presents safety data (adverse event rates) for Flublok versus a standard-dose influenza vaccine (IIV3) and does not provide any information about hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear but limited to safety/adverse event data; no antigen content information is shown.",
