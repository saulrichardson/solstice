  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing the percentage of subjects reporting severe responses (e.g., fever) across different studies, with values mostly <1%, and footnotes explaining study populations, severity definitions, and comparator vaccines (U.S.-licensed IIV3). does not support the claim because the table presents adverse event rates and severity definitions, not HA content per vaccine strain. Note: The image is clear and legible; no data on antigen or HA microgram content is presented.",
