  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing clinical trial efficacy results for Flublok versus comparator groups, showing number of cases, attack rates (per 100), vaccine efficacy percentages, and 95% confidence intervals for various endpoints (e.g., CDC-defined influenza-like illness, culture-confirmed influenza by strain), along with footnotes and references. The image presents efficacy data and attack rates but does not include any information on hemagglutinin content per strain; it does not support the claim about micrograms of HA in Flublok versus standard influenza vaccine. Note: No dosage or formulation details are shown in the table; content is limited to efficacy outcomes.",
