  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing the presentation of the vaccine (single-dose prefilled syringe), the carton NDC number (49281-724-10), and the component NDC number for ten 0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringes (49281-724-88), followed by storage and handling instructions. The image does not show any information on hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible, but it contains only packaging and handling details, not dose composition.",
