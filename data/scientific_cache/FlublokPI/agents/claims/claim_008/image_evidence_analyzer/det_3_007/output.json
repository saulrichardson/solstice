  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) and a comparator vaccine (N=4301) on outcomes including number of cases (n), attack rates (% and n/N) for all rtPCR-positive influenza, influenza A and B, and culture-confirmed protocol-defined ILI, with relative risk (RR) and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI). does not support the claim because the table presents efficacy data (attack rates, RR, rVE) and does not include any information on hemagglutinin microgram content per strain. Note: No dosage or HA content data is visible in the image; content is limited to clinical efficacy outcomes.",
