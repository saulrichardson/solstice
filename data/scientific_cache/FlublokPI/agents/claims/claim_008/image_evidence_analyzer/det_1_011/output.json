  "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-column table of solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, fever) showing percentages of subjects reporting each event for Flublok, placebo, and a comparator influenza vaccine. does not support the claim because the table presents reactogenicity data and does not include any information about hemagglutinin (HA) microgram content per strain for Flublok or a standard-dose influenza vaccine. Note: The image is clear in its presentation of adverse event rates but does not display any antigen dosage details; if the dosing info appears elsewhere off-screen, it is not visible here.",
