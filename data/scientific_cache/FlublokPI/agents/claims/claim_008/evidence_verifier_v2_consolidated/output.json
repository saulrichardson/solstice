      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes. Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain for each of the three influenza virus strains, for a total of 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose. This is contrasted with the standard-dose influenza vaccine, which is commonly known to contain 15 mcg of HA per strain (though the document does not state the standard-dose value, the quote fully substantiates the Flublok portion of the claim as required).",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears in the document, though not as a single contiguous paragraph. The key factual content is present and semantically equivalent. Specifically, the document states: 'Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use.
