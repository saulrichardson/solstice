  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-row, multi-column table presenting vaccine efficacy data from several Flublok studies, including numbers of cases, attack rates, calculated percent efficacy, and confidence intervals. Footnotes explain study populations, endpoints, and analyses. To the right is a list of references and abbreviations. The image presents clinical efficacy results and references but does not describe the manufacturing process or production platform. Therefore, it does not support the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel recombinant HA platform in insect cells with BEVS. Note: No manufacturing details are visible; any such information may lie outside the cropped portion of the figure.",
