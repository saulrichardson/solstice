  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing clinical efficacy data for Flublok vaccine versus saline placebo in adults aged 18\u201349 years, including numbers of cases, rates of influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed influenza, vaccine efficacy percentages, and 95% confidence intervals. The table presents clinical efficacy outcomes and does not provide any information about the production platform, expression system, or use of a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to read the clinical efficacy data, but it contains no production or manufacturing details.",
