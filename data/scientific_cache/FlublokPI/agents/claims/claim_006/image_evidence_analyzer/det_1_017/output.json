  "explanation": "A partial view of a table reporting percentages of subjects experiencing solicited adverse events (e.g., fever) post-vaccination, with footnotes defining severity grades and referencing clinical trial identifiers. The image shows safety data and footnotes about clinical studies but contains no information on vaccine production methods, so it does not support the claim.
