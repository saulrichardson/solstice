  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular summary of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (%) for two influenza vaccines (Flublok, N=1078; IIV3, N=1081), listing percentages of any, moderate, and severe pain, redness, swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, and fever. The table presents safety and reactogenicity data for Flublok versus IIV3 and contains no information about vaccine production methods, insect cells, baculovirus expression, or recombinant HA, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but limited to adverse event data and lacks any manufacturing or platform details.",
