  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting percentages of local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse events for Flublok (N=1078) and IIV3 (N=1081), categorized by any, moderate, and severe intensity. The table provides safety and reactogenicity data comparing Flublok and IIV3; it does not include any information on the production platform or recombinant HA expression system, and therefore does not support the claim.",
