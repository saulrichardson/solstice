  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) for Flublok and comparator groups in clinical trials, with footnotes about denominators, study registration numbers, definitions of severity, and trial demographics. The image presents safety/reactogenicity data and trial footnotes but contains no information on Flublok\u2019s production platform or use of a baculovirus expression vector system in insect cells, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No manufacturing details or references to recombinant HA expression methods are visible; only adverse event data is shown.",
