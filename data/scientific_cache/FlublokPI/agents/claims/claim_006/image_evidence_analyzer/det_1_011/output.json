  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-column table showing percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse events for Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231). Severity is broken down into any, moderate, and severe. This table presents safety and reactogenicity data and does not include any information about Flublok's production platform or use of recombinant HA in insect cells with a baculovirus expression vector system, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; image is clear and text legible.",
