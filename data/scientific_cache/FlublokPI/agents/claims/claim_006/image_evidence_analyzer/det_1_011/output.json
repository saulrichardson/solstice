  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing the percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse events in study participants receiving Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231). The table presents safety data on adverse events for Flublok versus placebo and does not mention the production platform or recombinant HA expression in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim.",
