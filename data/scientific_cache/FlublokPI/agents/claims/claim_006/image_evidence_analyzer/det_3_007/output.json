  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table displaying attack rates (n/N and %), number of subjects, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals for an influenza vaccine trial comparing Flublok to Fluarix Quadrivalent. does not support the claim because the image only presents clinical efficacy data and contains no information about Flublok\u2019s production platform, recombinant HA expression, insect cells, or use of a baculovirus expression vector system. Note: Image is clear but limited to efficacy results; lacks any manufacturing or production method details.",
