  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing percentages of solicited adverse events (local and systemic), categorized by severity (any, moderate, severe) for different studies; includes footnotes on subject numbers, reporting thresholds, study designations, and comparator vaccine. The table only presents safety data (adverse event rates) and contains no information on Flublok\u2019s production platform or recombinant HA expression in insect cells using BEVS, and therefore doesn't support the claim.
