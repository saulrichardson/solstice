  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing percentages of solicited local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events of Flublok (N=972) versus IIV3 (N=967), with breakdowns of any, moderate, and severe events. The table presents safety data (adverse event rates) for Flublok and IIV3, but contains no information on Flublok\u2019s production platform, recombinant HA expression, insect cells, or use of a baculovirus expression vector system, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear but focused on safety outcomes rather than manufacturing details.",
