  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing the percentages of local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events reported for Flublok (N=972) versus IIV3 (N=967). does not support the claim because the table only presents safety and adverse event data and contains no information on the production platform, expression system, or use of baculovirus in insect cells. Note: The image is clear and fully legible, but it contains only safety data and no manufacturing details.",
