  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-column page showing prescribing information for Flublok, including dosage and administration sections, contraindications, warnings and precautions, adverse reactions, use in specific populations, and a detailed table of contents listing sections 1 through 17. The image is a table of contents and dosing/administration information for Flublok and does not include any details about its production platform or recombinant HA expression in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible, but only contains section headings and does not address manufacturing or production details.",
