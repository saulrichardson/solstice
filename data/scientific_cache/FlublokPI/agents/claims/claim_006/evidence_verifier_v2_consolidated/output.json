      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes.",

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells (expresSF+\u00ae derived from Sf9 cells of Spodoptera frugiperda) using a baculovirus expression vector system (the baculovirus vector Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus). This matches the claim's assertion about the use of BEVS (baculovirus expression vector system) and insect cells for recombinant HA production.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears in the document, specifically in the section describing the composition and manufacturing process of Flublok.

Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins (\u226414.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA (\u226410 ng), and Triton X-100 (\u2264100 mcg).",

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that each dose of Flublok may contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins, which are insect cell proteins. This demonstrates that Flublok is produced using a system involving baculovirus and insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda), which is consistent with the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",
