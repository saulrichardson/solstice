      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly describes that Flublok is produced using recombinant HA expressed in insect cells (Sf9 cells) with a baculovirus vector, directly supporting the claim about its novel production platform."

The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This segment details the use of a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) in insect cells for the production of recombinant HA, affirming the claim regarding Flublok's manufacturing method."

      "quote": "Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single dose, prefilled syringes contain no natural rubber latex. Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins (\u226414.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA (\u226410 ng), and Triton X-100 (\u2264100 mcg).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides further evidence that Flublok is produced in insect cells using a baculovirus system, as it mentions residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins, supporting the claim about the production platform."
