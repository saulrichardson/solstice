      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly describes the production platform for Flublok, stating that recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), directly supporting the claim."

      "quote": "Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins (\u226414.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA (\u226410 ng), and Triton X-100 (\u2264100 mcg). Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides further evidence that Flublok is produced using a baculovirus expression system in insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda), as residual components from this process are present in the final product."

These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies.",
