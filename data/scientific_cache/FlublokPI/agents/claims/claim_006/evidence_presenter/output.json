  "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).",

    {
      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells (derived from Sf9 cells of Spodoptera frugiperda) using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), specifically mentioning the use of a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus). This matches all elements of the claim without requiring inference."

    {
      "quote": "Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single dose, pre filled syringes contain no natural rubber latex. Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins (\u226414.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA (\u226410 ng), and Triton X-100 (\u2264100 mcg).",
      "explanation": "The quote provides specific evidence that Flublok contains residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins, which directly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) in insect cells. The mention of Spodoptera frugiperda (the fall armyworm, an insect) and baculovirus confirms the use of insect cells and baculovirus in the production process. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim about the novel production platform."

    {
      "quote": "Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains... Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that each of the three hemagglutinin (HA) proteins in Flublok is expressed in an insect cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), which is the core of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) platform. This confirms that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform involving recombinant HA expression in insect cells via BEVS, as claimed."

      "explanation": "The quote directly describes the referenced vaccine as a 'baculovirus expressed hemagglutinin influenza vaccine.' This explicitly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) to express recombinant HA. The reference is used in the context of Flublok's clinical studies and supports the technical details of the claim."
