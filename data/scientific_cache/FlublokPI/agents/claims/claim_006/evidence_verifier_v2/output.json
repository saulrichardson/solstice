      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells (derived from Sf9 cells of Spodoptera frugiperda) using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), specifically mentioning the use of a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus). This matches all elements of the claim without requiring inference.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears in the document, though with minor formatting and wording differences due to OCR correction.
