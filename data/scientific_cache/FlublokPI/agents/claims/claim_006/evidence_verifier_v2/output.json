      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform where recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells (derived from Sf9 cells of Spodoptera frugiperda) using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), specifically naming the baculovirus (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus). This matches all elements of the claim without requiring inference.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears in the document, specifically in the section describing the manufacturing process of Flublok. The document states: 'Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts.

      "quote": "Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single dose, pre filled syringes contain no natural rubber latex. Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins (\u226414.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA (\u226410 ng), and Triton X-100 (\u2264100 mcg).",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly mentions that each dose of Flublok may contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins, which are insect cell proteins. This supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The presence of these residuals is explicit evidence of the use of both baculovirus and insect cells in the production process, as described in the claim.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears in the document on page 3, in the following passage: 'Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. ... Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculo virus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins (\u226414.3 mcg), baculo virus and cellular DNA (\u226410 ng), and Triton X-100 (\u2264100 mcg).

      "original_relevance": "This quote provides further evidence that Flublok is produced using a baculovirus system in insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda), as it mentions residual amounts of baculovirus and insect cell proteins, supporting the claim about the novel production platform."
