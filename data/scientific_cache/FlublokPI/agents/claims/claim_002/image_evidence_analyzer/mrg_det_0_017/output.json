  "explanation": "Prescribing information table of contents and partial safety/adverse reaction summary for Flublok influenza vaccine, including sections on dosage, contraindications, warnings, adverse reactions, use in specific populations, and other regulatory subsections. The image contains only administrative, safety, and usage sections for a specific flu vaccine (Flublok) and does not mention cell- or egg-based vaccine production, mutation potential, or effects on vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The text is clear and legible; no relevant information on production mutations is present.",
