  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A two-column page showing Flublok vaccine prescribing information. The top includes dosage, administration, contraindications, warnings and precautions, adverse reactions summary. The lower half is a detailed table of contents listing sections 1 through 17, including Indications and Usage, Dosage and Administration, Dosage Forms and Strengths, Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions (with subsections on allergic reactions, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, altered immunocompetence, limitations of vaccine effectiveness, syncope), Adverse Reactions (clinical trials, postmarketing), Use in Specific Populations, Description, Clinical Pharmacology, Nonclinical Toxicology (carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility), Clinical Studies, References, How Supplied/Storage and Handling, and Patient Counseling Information. The image is a table of contents and high-level prescribing information for Flublok and does not present any data or statements about mutations arising during egg- or cell-based production that could reduce vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, it does not support the claim.",
