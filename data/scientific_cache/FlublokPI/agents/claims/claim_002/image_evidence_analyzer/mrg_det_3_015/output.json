  "explanation": "A table listing the presentation (single-dose prefilled syringe), its carton NDC number, and components/NDC number, followed by section 16.2 with storage and handling instructions (temperature range, do not freeze, protect from light, expiration). The table and storage instructions make no mention of cell- or egg-based production methods, viral mutations, or impacts on vaccine effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis is based solely on the visible excerpt; no other context from surrounding pages was considered.",
