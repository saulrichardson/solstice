  "explanation": "An excerpt of a table from a clinical document (page 4) showing rows and columns of data with footnotes; no text visible relating to mutations arising during vaccine production or effects on effectiveness. does not support the claim because the table does not present any information about cell- or egg-based flu vaccine production mutations or their impact on vaccine effectiveness.
