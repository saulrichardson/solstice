  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing the vaccine presentation (single-dose prefilled syringe), its carton and component NDC numbers, followed by storage and handling instructions (temperature range, protect from light, etc.). does not support the claim because the image only provides packaging identifiers and storage conditions, with no mention of production methods, mutations, or vaccine effectiveness. Note: Limited to a small excerpt of the document; broader context not shown, but no relevant information on mutations is visible here.",
