  "explanation": "A table showing clinical trial results in adults 18\u201349 years comparing the Flublok vaccine (recombinant influenza vaccine) versus saline placebo, with numbers of cases, rates (%) of illness by matched vaccine strains and any strains, and vaccine efficacy percentages with 95% confidence intervals. This table provides efficacy data for a recombinant (insect cell\u2013derived) influenza vaccine compared to placebo and does not mention egg- or cell-based production mutations or their impact on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and fully legible; no relevant information on vaccine production mutations is present.",
