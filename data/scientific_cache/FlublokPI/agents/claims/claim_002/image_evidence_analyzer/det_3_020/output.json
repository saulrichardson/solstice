  "explanation": "A table titled \u201cAdults 18\u201349 Years of Age, Study 1\u201d comparing Flublok vaccine versus saline placebo. It lists case definitions (e.g., positive cultures with matched strains, any ILI), the number of cases (n), rates (%), vaccine efficacy (%), and 95% confidence intervals for each outcome. The table provides efficacy data for the Flublok vaccine compared to placebo but does not discuss cell- or egg-based vaccine production, mutation development during production, or any impact of such mutations on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim.
