  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A table titled 'Adults 18\u201349 Years of Age, Study 1' comparing Flublok (N=2344) versus saline placebo (N=2304) showing numbers and rates of influenza cases by culture-confirmed infection with strains matched to the vaccine versus any strain, along with calculated vaccine efficacy percentages and 95% confidence intervals. The table presents clinical efficacy data for the Flublok vaccine against matched and any influenza strains but makes no mention of vaccine production methods, mutations arising during egg- or cell-based manufacturing, or their impact on effectiveness; therefore it does not support the claim.",
