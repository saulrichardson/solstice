  "explanation": "A table summarizing influenza vaccine efficacy in adults aged 18\u201349 years in Study I, comparing Flublok (recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine) versus saline placebo. It lists numbers of culture\u2010confirmed cases and rates for matched vaccine strains and for all strains (CDC\u2010ILI and any ILI definitions), along with percent vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence intervals. The table presents efficacy data for a recombinant HA vaccine versus placebo and makes no reference to cell- or egg-based vaccine production or mutation events; it does not support the claim.",
