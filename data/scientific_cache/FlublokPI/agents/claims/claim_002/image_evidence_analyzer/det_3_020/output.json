  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing vaccine efficacy results from multiple studies comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine) to a licensed egg-based quadrivalent inactivated vaccine. Columns include number of cases, attack rates per 100 persons, relative risk, percent vaccine efficacy, and 95% confidence intervals for endpoints defined as RT-PCR\u2013confirmed influenza-like illness with strains matched to the vaccine and with any strain. The table provides clinical efficacy data and confidence intervals for different vaccine endpoints but does not present any data or discussion of mutations arising during cell- or egg-based vaccine production. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to assess content. The table focuses on efficacy outcomes, not virological or production process analyses.",
