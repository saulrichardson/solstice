  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing rates (%) of solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse events graded as any, moderate, or severe in two vaccine groups: Flublok (N=1078) and IIV3 (N=1081). The table reports adverse event percentages for two influenza vaccines and contains no information on production methods, mutation development, or vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; no mutation or effectiveness data are presented.",
