  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-column table comparing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (percentages of any, moderate, and severe events) for two influenza vaccines: Flublok (N=1078) and IIV3 (N=1081). Local events include pain, redness, firmness/swelling; systemic events include fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, and fever. This table reports adverse event rates but does not address vaccine production methods or the potential for mutations during cell- or egg-based manufacturing, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The table is clear and legible; however, it contains safety data only and no information relevant to viral mutations or production processes.",
