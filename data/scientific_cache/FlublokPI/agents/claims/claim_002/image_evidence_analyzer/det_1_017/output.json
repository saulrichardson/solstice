  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse events (any, moderate, severe) in two groups: Flublok (N=1078) and IIV3 (N=1081). The table only reports rates of local and systemic adverse events for Flublok versus IIV3; it contains no information on cell- or egg-based vaccine production, mutation potential, or vaccine effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited to safety/reactogenicity data; no production or mutation information present.",
