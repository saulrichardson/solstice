  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing solicited local and systemic adverse event percentages (any, moderate, severe) for two influenza vaccines: Flublok (N=1078) and IIV3 (N=1081). Local events include pain, redness, firmness/swelling; systemic events include fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever. The image only presents safety/reactogenicity data for Flublok versus IIV3 and contains no information on production methods, viral mutations, or vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible table content; no text on production or mutation is present.",
