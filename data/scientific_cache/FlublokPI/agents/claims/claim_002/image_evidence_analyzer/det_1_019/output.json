  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-column table listing the percentages of solicited local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events classified as any, moderate, or severe for two influenza vaccines (Flublok, N=972; IIV3, N=967). The table presents safety/reactogenicity data (local and systemic adverse event rates) for two flu vaccines and contains no information on mutations arising during production or their impact on effectiveness; it does not support the claim.",
