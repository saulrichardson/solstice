  "explanation": "A table comparing the percentage of subjects reporting local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events (any, moderate, severe) after vaccination with Flublok (N=972) versus IIV3 (N=967). This table reports reactogenicity (safety) outcomes for two flu vaccines but contains no information about mutations arising during production or their impact on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim.",
