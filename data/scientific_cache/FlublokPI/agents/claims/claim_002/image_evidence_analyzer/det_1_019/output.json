  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-column table comparing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (percentages of any, moderate, and severe events) for Flublok (recombinant vaccine; N=972) versus IIV3 (egg-based inactivated vaccine; N=967). Local events include pain, firmness/swelling, redness; systemic events include headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, and fever. The table only presents reactogenicity and safety data for two flu vaccines and contains no information on mutations arising during cell- or egg-based production or on vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Image quality is clear; no relevant data on production mutations or impact on efficacy are present.",
