  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing percentages of subjects reporting solicited adverse responses (any, moderate, severe) for different vaccine studies, with footnotes describing study populations and registration details. The table presents safety/adverse event data and does not address vaccine production methods or mutation potential, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table is clear but limited to adverse event rates; no information on cell- or egg-based production or mutation effects.",
