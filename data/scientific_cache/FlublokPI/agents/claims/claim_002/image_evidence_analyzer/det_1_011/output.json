  "explanation": "A two\u2010column table summarizing the percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse events within 7 days after vaccination in the per-protocol population: Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231), with breakdowns for any, moderate, and severe events. does not support the claim because the table provides data on adverse events following vaccination and does not address vaccine production processes, potential mutations during manufacturing, or their effects on effectiveness. Note: The table is focused on safety endpoints; no data on mutation occurrence or vaccine efficacy are presented.",
