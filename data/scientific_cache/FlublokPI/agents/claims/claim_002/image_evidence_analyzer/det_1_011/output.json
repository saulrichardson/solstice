  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing percentages of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions (pain, redness, firmness/swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) reported in clinical trials for Flublok (cell-based recombinant vaccine) versus a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine comparator, with accompanying footnotes on study registration, denominators, and severity definitions. The table only reports reactogenicity and safety outcomes and contains no information about vaccine production, viral mutations, or effects on effectiveness, so it does not support the claim. Note: Limited to visible contents; no mutation or production process details are shown.",
