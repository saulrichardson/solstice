  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",

  "explanation": "A table summarizing influenza attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) for Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a comparator vaccine (N=4301). Columns show number of rtPCR-positive influenza cases (overall, type A, type B), attack rates (%), relative risk (RR), and rVE % with 95% confidence intervals. The table provides comparative efficacy data between Flublok and a comparator vaccine but contains no information on mutations arising during egg- or cell-based production or their impact on vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, it does not support the claim Note: The image is clear and complete for efficacy data but lacks any mechanistic or production\u2010related mutation details",
