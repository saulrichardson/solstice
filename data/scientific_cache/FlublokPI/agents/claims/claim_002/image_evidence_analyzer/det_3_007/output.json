  "explanation": "A table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a Comparator (N=4301) showing for each group the number of rtPCR-positive influenza cases (overall, type A, type B) and culture-confirmed ILI, attack rates (n/N and %), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE% with 95% CI). The table presents comparative efficacy data between a recombinant vaccine and a comparator but does not mention the occurrence of mutations during vaccine production or link reduced effectiveness to such mutations, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table clearly shows efficacy outcomes but offers no information on production-related mutations; the comparator is presumed egg-based but this is not explicitly stated in the figure.",
