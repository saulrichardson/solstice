  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a comparator vaccine (N=4301), showing the number of cases (n), attack rates (% n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals for all rtPCR-positive influenza, Influenza A, Influenza B, and culture-confirmed protocol-defined ILI. The table reports comparative efficacy outcomes but does not mention vaccine production methods or the occurrence of mutations during egg- or cell-based manufacturing, so it does not support the claim. Note: Headings are legible and data are clear, but the specific production method of the comparator vaccine is not labeled; no direct reference to mutations is present.",
