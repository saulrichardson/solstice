  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing the clinical attack rates, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) between a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Flublok) and a comparator (presumably egg- or cell-based), showing numbers vaccinated, events (n), percentage attack rates, RR, and rVE with 95% confidence intervals for all rtPCR-positive influenza, influenza A, influenza B, and culture-confirmed influenza\u2010like illness. The table presents clinical effectiveness data (attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy) but contains no information about vaccine production methods, mutations arising during production, or any mechanistic evidence of egg- or cell-based vaccine mutation reducing effectiveness. It does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible table content; no mention of mutation or production processes is present.",
