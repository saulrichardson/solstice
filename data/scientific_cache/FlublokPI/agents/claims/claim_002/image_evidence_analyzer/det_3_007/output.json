  "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial table with columns for Attack Rate (n/N), number of cases (n), Attack Rate % (n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI) comparing a study influenza vaccine to a U.S.-licensed egg-based influenza vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent). Footnotes define RT-PCR confirmed cases, comparator vaccine details, and rVE calculation. The table reports clinical attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy against various influenza strains but does not mention production-related mutations or their impact on effectiveness, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image is a partial table without any reference to antigenic or production mutations; context on strain production methods is not provided.",
