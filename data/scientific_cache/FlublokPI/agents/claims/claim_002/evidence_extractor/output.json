      "quote": "Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year's influenza vaccine.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that influenza viruses frequently develop antigenic variants, which is a key reason why vaccine strains must be updated annually. This supports the claim by establishing that mutations (antigenic drift) are a known issue in influenza virus biology, which can affect vaccine effectiveness."
