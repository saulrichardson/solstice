      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies to each virus strain. Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok contains recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from the three influenza virus strains specified by health authorities for the annual vaccine, and that it is standardized according to USPHS requirements. This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains."
