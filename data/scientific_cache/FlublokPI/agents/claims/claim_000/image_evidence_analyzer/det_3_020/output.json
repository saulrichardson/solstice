  "explanation": "A table summarizing vaccine efficacy from a clinical trial of Flublok. It lists numbers of rtPCR-positive influenza cases in vaccine and placebo groups for strains matched to the vaccine and for all strains regardless of match. It shows attack rates, relative risks, vaccine efficacy percentages, and 95% confidence intervals. Footnotes describe CDC-ILI definitions, primary and secondary endpoints, study identifiers, and that Flublok quadrivalent uses overlapping compositions. The table presents efficacy data against matched strains versus all strains but does not address whether Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains; it does not support the claim. Note: The figure lacks any information about WHO/FDA strain selection or antigenic identity confirmation.",
