  "explanation": "A table from a clinical study in adults 18\u201349 years comparing Flublok (N=2344) versus saline placebo (N=2304). It lists numbers and rates of influenza cases confirmed by positive culture, subdivided into cases with strains represented in the vaccine (matched strains) and cases with any strain, along with calculated vaccine efficacy percentages and 95% confidence intervals. The table presents Flublok efficacy against strains that were represented in the vaccine and against all strains, but it does not provide any data on antigenic characterization or direct comparison to WHO- or FDA-selected strain antigens. Therefore, it does not support the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.
