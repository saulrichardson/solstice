  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table titled 'Adults 18\u201349 Years of Age, Study 1' comparing Flublok (N=2344) versus saline placebo (N=2304). It lists case counts and rates for 'positive culture with a strain represented in the vaccine' (matched strains) and 'positive culture with any strain, regardless of match,' plus calculated vaccine efficacy (%) and 95% confidence intervals for each outcome. The table reports clinical case counts, rates, and vaccine efficacy against strains 'represented in the vaccine,' but it does not present any data on antigenic matching to WHO\u2010 or FDA\u2010selected strains or demonstrate identical antigenic composition. Therefore, it doesn't support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible table; no mention of WHO or FDA strain selection or antigenic characterization in the figure.",
