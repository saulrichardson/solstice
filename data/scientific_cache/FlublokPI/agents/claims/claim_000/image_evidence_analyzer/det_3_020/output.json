  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing influenza vaccine efficacy in adults aged 18\u201349 comparing Flublok (N=2344) to saline placebo (N=2304). It reports numbers and rates of culture\u2010confirmed influenza cases for strains represented in the vaccine ('matched strains') and for any strain, along with calculated vaccine efficacy percentages and 95% confidence intervals. The table presents clinical efficacy data against strains included in the Flublok vaccine but does not provide any information about WHO or FDA strain selection processes or demonstrate that Flublok uses identical antigenic matches to WHO\u2010 or FDA\u2010selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis is based solely on the visible table; no mention of WHO/FDA guidance or antigenic matching protocols is present.",
