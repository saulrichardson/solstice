  "explanation": "A table summarizing influenza vaccine efficacy in adults 18\u201349 years old (Study 1), comparing Flublok versus saline placebo. It lists cases (n), rates (%), and Flublok vaccine efficacy (%) with 95% confidence intervals for: positive culture with a strain represented in the vaccine (matched strains) and positive culture with any strain regardless of match, as well as any influenza-like illness (ILI) outcomes. The table reports efficacy data for strains included in the vaccine versus any strains but contains no information on antigenic matching processes or explicit confirmation that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected strains, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Text is legible; however, the figure does not address antigenic matching or WHO/FDA strain selection.",
