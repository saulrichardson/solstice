  "explanation": "A table listing influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigens used in Flublok alongside the WHO- and FDA-recommended vaccine strains for a given influenza season, showing matching strain names for each HA component (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B). Evidence: Flublok\u2019s recombinant HA antigens are labeled with the exact same WHO- and FDA-selected strain designations (e.g., A/California/07/2009, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, B/Brisbane/60/2008) indicating an identical antigenic match. supports the claim because the table directly demonstrates that Flublok includes HA proteins matching the WHO- and FDA-recommended strains by identical strain name and subtype.",
