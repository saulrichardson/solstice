  "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) and a comparator vaccine (N=4301) on outcomes including all rtPCR\u2010positive influenza, influenza A, influenza B, and culture\u2010confirmed protocol\u2010defined influenza\u2010like illness. Columns report event counts (n), attack rates (% n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI). The table presents clinical efficacy outcomes (attack rates, relative risk, and relative vaccine efficacy) but contains no data or commentary on antigenic matching to WHO\u2010 or FDA\u2010selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible table; no section on antigenic characterization is shown.",
