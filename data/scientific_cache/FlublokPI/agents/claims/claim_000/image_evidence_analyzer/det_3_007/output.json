  "explanation": "A clinical trial results table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) with a comparator (N=4301). It lists the number of cases (n), attack rates (% n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI) for all rtPCR-positive influenza, rtPCR-positive influenza A, rtPCR-positive influenza B, and culture-confirmed protocol-defined influenza-like illness. The table presents comparative efficacy data (attack rates, RR, rVE) but contains no information on antigenic matching or alignment with WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and thus does not support the claim. Note: The figure is clear but limited to efficacy outcomes; no antigenic characterization data are shown.",
