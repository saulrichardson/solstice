  "explanation": "A table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a comparator vaccine (N=4301) showing number of cases (n), attack rates (% n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI) for rtPCR-positive influenza (all, A, B) and culture-confirmed protocol-defined ILI. The image presents clinical efficacy outcomes (attack rates, RR, and rVE) but contains no data on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to the provided table; no antigenic or strain-match information is shown.",
