  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting influenza attack rates, number of cases (n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals comparing Flublok Quadrivalent to a comparator flu vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent). Footnotes describe study population, case definition by RT-PCR, and per-protocol analysis criteria. The figure shows only clinical efficacy endpoints (attack rates, RR, rVE) and study definitions; it does not include any information about antigenic match or strain selection, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but limited to efficacy data; no antigenic characterization or WHO/FDA strain matching information is presented.",
