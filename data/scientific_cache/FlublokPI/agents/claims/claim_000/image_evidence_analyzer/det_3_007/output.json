  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A clinical trial results table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a comparator vaccine (N=4301) across outcomes: all rtPCR-positive influenza, influenza A, influenza B, and culture-confirmed ILI; showing number of cases, attack rates (% n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI). The table presents clinical efficacy outcomes (attack rates, RR, rVE) but contains no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected strains. Therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to the visible table; no other context on antigenic characterization is provided.",
