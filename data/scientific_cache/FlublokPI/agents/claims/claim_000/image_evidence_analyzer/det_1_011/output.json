  "explanation": "A table displaying percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse events for Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231), broken down by any, moderate, and severe reactions. The table reports safety/reactogenicity data for Flublok and placebo and contains no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, and thus does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and complete; no relevant antigenic match data present.",
