Severity categories (any, moderate, severe) are shown for each symptom. does not support the claim because the table presents safety and reactogenicity data only and contains no information on antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains. Note: Analysis limited to visible safety data; no content on antigen composition or strain matching is present.",
