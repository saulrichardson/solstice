  "explanation": "A two-column table comparing local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse event rates (%) in subjects receiving Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231). Severity categories (Any, Moderate, Severe) are shown for each event. The table only reports reactogenicity data (local and systemic adverse events) for Flublok versus placebo and contains no information about antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to displayed table; no evidence of antigenic matching data in this excerpt.",
