  "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, fever) following vaccination with Flublok and comparators, accompanied by footnotes detailing data collection, study identifiers, and definitions of severity. The image presents safety/reactogenicity data and footnotes about study design; it does not address antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image appears to show only adverse event data and contains no information about antigenic matching; full document context is not provided but the visible content is unrelated to the claim.",
