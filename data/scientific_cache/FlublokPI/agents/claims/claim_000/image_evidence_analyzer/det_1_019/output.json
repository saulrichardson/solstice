  "explanation": "A table comparing percentages of local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events of Flublok (N=972) versus IIV3 (N=967), categorized by any, moderate, and severe events. The table presents safety and reactogenicity data for Flublok and IIV3 but contains no information about antigenic matching to WHO- or FDA-selected flu strains, so it does not support the claim.",
