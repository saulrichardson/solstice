  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (%) by severity (any, moderate, severe) for Flublok (N=972) versus IIV3 (N=967), listing events such as pain, firmness/swelling, redness, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, and fever. The table presents adverse event rates for Flublok and IIV3 but contains no data on antigenic match or strain selection by WHO or FDA, so it does not support the claim.",
