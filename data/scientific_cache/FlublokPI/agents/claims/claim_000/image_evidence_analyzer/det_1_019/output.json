  "explanation": "A two-column table comparing Flublok (N=972) and IIV3 (N=967) vaccines listing the percentages of subjects reporting local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events categorized as Any, Moderate, or Severe. The table presents safety and reactogenicity data for Flublok versus IIV3 and contains no information on antigenic match with WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, and therefore does not support the claim.",
