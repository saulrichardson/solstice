  "explanation": "Partial table and footnotes from a clinical study showing percentages of severe adverse responses reported by subjects, grading criteria for temperature elevations (mild, moderate, severe), and notes about study populations and protocols. The image displays safety and adverse event data with footnotes, and does not include any information about antigenic match to WHO- or FDA-selected influenza strains, so it does not support the claim. Note: Image is a partial view of safety data; no relevant antigenic or strain information is present.",
