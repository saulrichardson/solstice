  "explanation": "A table comparing the percentage of solicited local and systemic adverse events (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache) for Flublok versus a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3), broken down by any, moderate, and severe events. The table presents safety and reactogenicity data and contains no information on antigenic match or strain selection, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to the visible content, which does not include any antigenic or strain-matching data.",
