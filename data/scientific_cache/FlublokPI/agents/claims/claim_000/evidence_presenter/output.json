      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies. Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the following section: 'Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hem agglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies. Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' The wording is nearly identical to the quote provided, with only minor formatting and spacing differences, and all technical content and numbers are preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins from the three influenza virus strains specified by health authorities for the annual vaccine, and that it is standardized according to USPHS requirements. It also lists the exact strains included for the 2024-2025 season, matching those selected by WHO and FDA. This directly supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with the WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains, as it is formulated to contain the antigens from those specific strains."

      "explanation": "A table listing influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigens used in Flublok alongside the WHO- and FDA-recommended vaccine strains for a given influenza season, showing matching strain names for each HA component (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B). Evidence: Flublok\u2019s recombinant HA antigens are labeled with the exact same WHO- and FDA-selected strain designations (e.g., A/California/07/2009, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, B/Brisbane/60/2008) indicating an identical antigenic match. supports the claim because the table directly demonstrates that Flublok includes HA proteins matching the WHO- and FDA-recommended strains by identical strain name and subtype."
