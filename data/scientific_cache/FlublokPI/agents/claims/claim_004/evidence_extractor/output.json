      "relevance_explanation": "This reference describes a study that directly compares the immunogenicity (antibody response) of recombinant hemagglutinin vaccines (higher-dose, non-egg-based) to standard trivalent inactivated vaccines (egg-based), providing evidence relevant to the claim."

      "relevance_explanation": "This statement establishes that Flublok is a higher-dose (135 mcg total HA) recombinant vaccine and is not egg-based, which is necessary context for understanding the basis of the claim regarding its potentially more robust antibody response compared to standard-dose, egg-based vaccines."
