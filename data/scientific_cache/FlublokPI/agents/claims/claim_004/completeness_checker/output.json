      "relevance_explanation": "This quote demonstrates that the antibody response (measured by HI) to Flublok is a key outcome in clinical trials, and that differences in HI response are used to compare vaccine immunogenicity. While this example is in children and shows a diminished response, it establishes that HI response is a relevant and measured endpoint for Flublok, supporting the context for comparing robust antibody responses between vaccine types.",
