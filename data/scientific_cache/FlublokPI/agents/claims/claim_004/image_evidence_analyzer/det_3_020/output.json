  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table titled 'Adults 18\u201349 Years of Age, Study 1' showing case counts, rates (%) and vaccine efficacy (%) with 95% confidence intervals for Flublok (a recombinant flu vaccine) versus saline placebo across various case definitions (positive culture with matched strains, any ILI, all strains, subtypes A and B). does not support the claim because the table compares Flublok to placebo and reports vaccine efficacy, without any comparison to an egg-based standard-dose vaccine or antibody response data. Note: The table provides efficacy against clinical endpoints but no immunogenicity or dose-comparison data; no standard-dose egg-based vaccine arm is present.",
