  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multirow table summarizing influenza vaccine efficacy outcomes (attack rates per group, number of culture-confirmed cases, calculated vaccine efficacy percentages and 95% confidence intervals) for Flublok recombinant quadrivalent vaccine versus placebo or comparator; accompanied by extensive footnotes and references. The image presents clinical efficacy data (infection rates and vaccine efficacy percentages) rather than measurements of antibody responses, so it does not support the claim about a more robust antibody response with a higher-dose recombinant vaccine. Note: The table is clear but focuses on disease incidence and efficacy rather than immunogenicity or antibody titers; no direct immunogenicity data are shown.",
