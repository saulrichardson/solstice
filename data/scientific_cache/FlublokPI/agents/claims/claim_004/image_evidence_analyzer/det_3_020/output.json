  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",

  "explanation": "A table summarizing outcomes in adults aged 18\u201349 years from a clinical study comparing the recombinant influenza vaccine Flublok (N=2344) versus a saline placebo (N=2304). The table lists numbers and rates of culture-confirmed influenza cases (by matched strain, any strain, subtype A, type B) and calculates vaccine efficacy percentages with 95% confidence intervals. The table compares Flublok to a saline placebo and reports efficacy against culture\u2010confirmed influenza, not antibody titers or comparison against an egg-based standard-dose vaccine. Therefore, it does not support the claim about a more robust antibody response induced by a higher-dose recombinant vaccine versus an egg-based standard-dose vaccine. Note: The image is clear and complete for what it presents, but it reports clinical efficacy rather than immunogenicity and lacks any egg-based comparator.",
