  "explanation": "A table titled 'Adults 18\u201349 Years of Age, Study 1' showing numbers and rates of culture-confirmed influenza cases in Flublok (recombinant vaccine) versus saline placebo groups, with calculated vaccine efficacy percentages and 95% confidence intervals for matched strains and any strains. does not support the claim because the table provides efficacy outcomes compared to placebo rather than antibody response data or comparisons with egg-based standard-dose vaccines. Note: The image only shows clinical efficacy endpoints, not immunogenicity or antibody titer measurements, and does not include any egg-based vaccine comparator.",
