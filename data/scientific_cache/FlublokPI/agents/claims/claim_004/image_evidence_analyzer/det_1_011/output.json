  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse events categorized as Any, Moderate, or Severe for participants receiving Flublok (recombinant vaccine) versus placebo. The table presents safety and tolerability data (adverse event rates) for Flublok versus placebo and does not report any measures of antibody response or compare to egg-based standard-dose vaccines; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Only safety data are shown; no immunogenicity or comparative vaccine efficacy data are present.",
