  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-column table comparing Flublok (recombinant flu vaccine) and placebo groups (N=2272 vs. N=2231) listing percentages of local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse events, broken down by any, moderate, and severe intensity. The table only presents safety and tolerability data (adverse event rates) for Flublok versus placebo. It contains no immunogenicity or antibody response data and no comparison to egg-based standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible safety data; no immunogenicity measures are reported in the image.",
