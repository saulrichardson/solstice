  "explanation": "Table presenting percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse events in subjects receiving Flublok (recombinant influenza vaccine) versus placebo. The table contains only safety and reactogenicity data comparing Flublok to placebo and provides no immunogenicity or antibody response measurements, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited by the absence of immunogenicity data in the image; the table focuses solely on adverse event rates.",
