  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing solicited local and systemic reactogenicity (e.g., pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) from clinical trials of a recombinant flu vaccine (Flublok) versus egg-based comparators, including denominators, percentages, and footnotes explaining severity grading and study registries. does not support the claim because the table presents only safety/reactogenicity data and contains no immunogenicity or antibody response measurements, so it does not address whether a higher-dose recombinant vaccine induces a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines Note: Image is clear but focuses solely on adverse event rates; no antibody titers or immunogenicity data are shown",
