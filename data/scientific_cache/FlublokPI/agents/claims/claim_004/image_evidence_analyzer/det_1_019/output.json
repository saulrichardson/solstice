  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-column table comparing Flublok (N=972) and IIV3 (N=967) showing percentages of solicited local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events classified as any, moderate, or severe. The table presents safety and reactogenicity data for Flublok versus IIV3 but contains no immunogenicity or antibody response measurements; it does not support the claim about a more robust antibody response. Note: Analysis limited by absence of immunogenicity data in the provided image.",
