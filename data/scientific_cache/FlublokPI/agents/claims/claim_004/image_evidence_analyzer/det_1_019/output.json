  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing the frequency (%) of solicited local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events of two flu vaccines: Flublok (N=972) and IIV3 (N=967), broken down by any, moderate, and severe events. The table presents only safety and reactogenicity data (local and systemic adverse event rates) and contains no measurements of antibody titers or immunogenicity; therefore, it does not support the claim about a more robust antibody response. Note: Analysis limited by the absence of immunogenicity data in the provided table.",
