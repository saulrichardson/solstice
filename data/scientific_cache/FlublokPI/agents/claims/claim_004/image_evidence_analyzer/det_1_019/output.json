  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-column table comparing Flublok (recombinant vaccine, N=972) and IIV3 (egg-based vaccine, N=967) for rates (%) of solicited local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events graded as any, moderate, or severe. The table only reports adverse event rates and contains no immunogenicity or antibody response data, so it does not support the claim. Note: No immunogenicity data are presented; analysis limited to safety/tolerability outcomes.",
