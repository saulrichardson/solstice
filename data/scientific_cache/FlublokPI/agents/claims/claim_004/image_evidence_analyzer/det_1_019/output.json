  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table of solicited adverse events showing percentages of subjects reporting any, moderate, or severe reactions (injection\u2010site and systemic) across different study vaccines, with footnotes defining severity and study details. The table presents only safety data (rates of adverse events by severity) and contains no immunogenicity or antibody\u2010response measurements, so it does not support the claim. Note: The table view is partial and focused on adverse events; no antibody titer or serologic data are visible.",
