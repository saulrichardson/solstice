  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing vaccine presentation (Single-Dose Prefilled Syringe), its carton NDC number (49281-724-10), components (ten 0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringes [49281-724-88]) followed by storage and handling instructions (refrigeration temperature, do not freeze, protect from light, discard after expiration). The table only provides packaging (NDC numbers) and storage/handling information and contains no data on immunogenicity or antibody responses of higher-dose recombinant versus egg-based standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim Note: Limited to packaging/handling details; no clinical or immunogenicity data present",
