  "claim_id": "claim_004",
  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing attack rates, relative risks (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE%) for Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a comparator vaccine (N=4301) across four outcomes: all rtPCR-positive influenza, rtPCR-positive influenza A, rtPCR-positive influenza B, and culture-confirmed protocol-defined influenza-like illness (ILI). Evidence: Relative vaccine efficacy percentages (e.g., 30% rVE for all rtPCR-positive influenza; 36% for influenza A) and corresponding attack rates and RRs comparing Flublok to the comparator. The table presents clinical outcomes and rVE but includes no measurements of antibody titers or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim regarding a more robust antibody response with higher-dose recombinant vaccine. Note: The image only shows clinical efficacy data; lack of immunogenicity endpoints limits assessment of antibody response.",
