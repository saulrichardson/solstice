  "explanation": "A table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a comparator vaccine (N=4301) across endpoints: all rtPCR-positive influenza, influenza A, influenza B, and culture-confirmed protocol-defined ILI. For each endpoint it lists number of cases (n), attack rate %, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE %) with 95% CI. The table presents clinical attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy for Flublok versus a comparator but provides no data on antibody titers or immunologic measurements. Therefore, it does not support the claim regarding a more robust antibody response. Note: The image quality is sufficient to read the table; however, it only shows efficacy outcomes and no immunogenicity or antibody response data.",
