  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing outcomes between Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) and a standard-dose egg-based comparator (N=4301). For each outcome (all rtPCR-positive influenza, influenza A, influenza B, and culture-confirmed protocol-defined ILI), it lists number of cases (n), attack rate % (n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI). The table presents clinical attack rates and vaccine efficacy comparisons, not antibody titers or immunogenicity measures, and therefore does not support the claim regarding a more robust antibody response. Note: No immunogenicity or antibody data are shown; analysis limited to visible clinical efficacy outcomes.",
