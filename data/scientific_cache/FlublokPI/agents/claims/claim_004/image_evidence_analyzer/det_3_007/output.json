  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing attack rates (n/N and %), sample sizes, relative risks (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals for PCR-confirmed influenza cases, comparing a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine to an egg-based standard-dose Fluarix Quadrivalent vaccine. does not support the claim because the table presents clinical attack rates and efficacy outcomes against confirmed influenza rather than antibody response or immunogenicity data, so it contains no direct evidence of a more robust antibody response. Note: The image appears slightly cropped but clearly displays clinical efficacy metrics; no immunogenicity or antibody titer data are shown.",
