  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse events for two vaccine groups: Flublok (N=1078) and IIV3 (N=1081), broken down by any, moderate, and severe events. The table reports safety/reactogenicity outcomes only and contains no data on antibody levels, seroconversion rates, or other immunogenicity measures, so it does not support the claim Note: The table is clear but limited to adverse event data; no immunogenicity endpoints are shown",
