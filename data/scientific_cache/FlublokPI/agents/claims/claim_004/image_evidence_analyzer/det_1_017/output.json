  "explanation": "A table showing percentages of local and systemic adverse events (pain, redness, firmness/swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) categorized as Any, moderate, and severe for two vaccine groups: Flublok (recombinant, N=1078) and IIV3 (egg-based, N=1081). does not support the claim because the table reports reactogenicity outcomes rather than antibody response or immunogenicity data, so it doesn't support the claim Note: Table only includes safety/reactogenicity data; no immunogenicity or antibody response measures are provided.",
