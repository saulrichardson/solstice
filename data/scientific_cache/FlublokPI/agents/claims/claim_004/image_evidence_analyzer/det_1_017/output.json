  "explanation": "Table displaying the percentage of solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse reactions classified as any, moderate, or severe in participants receiving Flublok (N=1078) versus IIV3 (N=1081). The table presents safety/reactogenicity data and contains no immunogenicity or antibody response measurements, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for adverse event data; however, no antibody or immune response information is provided.",
