  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A portion of the prescribing information for Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine) showing indications, dosage and administration, contraindications, warnings, adverse reaction frequencies in adults, contact information, and a detailed table of contents for the full prescribing information. This page provides safety/adverse reaction data and an index of label sections but does not present any immunogenicity or antibody response comparisons between higher-dose recombinant vaccine and egg-based standard-dose vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The page quality is sufficient to see adverse reaction and table of contents information, but no immunogenicity data; additional pages may contain relevant data not shown here.",
