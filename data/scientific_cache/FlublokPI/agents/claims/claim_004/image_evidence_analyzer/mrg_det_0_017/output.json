  "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A page showing prescribing information for Flublok vaccine, including dosage and administration instructions, dosage forms and strengths, contraindications, warnings and precautions, adverse reactions, and a table of contents for full prescribing information sections. The image contains only general product labeling and a table of contents with no data on antibody responses or direct comparisons between higher-dose recombinant vaccines and egg-based standard-dose vaccines, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: No study data or immunogenicity results are visible; analysis limited to prescribing information text, not clinical trial outcomes.",
