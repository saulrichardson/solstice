      "original_explanation": "This quote demonstrates that the antibody response (measured by HI) to Flublok is a key immunogenicity endpoint, and that differences in HI response are used to compare vaccine effectiveness. While this example is in children and shows a diminished response, it establishes that HI response is a direct measure of vaccine-induced immunity, supporting the relevance of comparing HI responses between higher-dose recombinant and standard-dose egg-based vaccines in adults."

      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok induces a humoral immune response measured by HI antibody titers, which is the standard for assessing the robustness of the antibody response. This supports the claim by clarifying that the intended immunogenic effect of the higher-dose recombinant vaccine is directly measured by antibody titers, the same endpoint used to compare it to standard-dose egg-based vaccines."
