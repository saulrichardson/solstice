      "quote": "Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains... Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives.",

      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote demonstrates that the antibody response (measured by HI titers) to Flublok can be directly compared to that of a standard egg-based vaccine, supporting the use of immunogenicity as a measure of vaccine response. While it notes diminished response in a specific population, it affirms that antibody response is a key endpoint for comparison, which is relevant to the claim about robust antibody responses in other age groups."

These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody to each virus strain.",
      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote explicitly states that Flublok induces a humoral immune response, measured by HI antibody titers, which is the standard for assessing antibody response. This supports the claim that Flublok is designed to induce a robust antibody response, which can be compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines."
