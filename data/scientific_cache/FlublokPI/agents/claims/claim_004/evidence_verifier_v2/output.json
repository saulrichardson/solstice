      "quote": "For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote provides explicit information that Flublok (the recombinant flu vaccine) contains a total of 135 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA from each of three strains. This is a higher antigen dose than standard-dose egg-based influenza vaccines, which typically contain 15 mcg HA per strain (45 mcg total). The claim is that a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines. While the quote does not directly state that the higher dose induces a more robust antibody response, it does provide the key factual support that Flublok is a higher-dose recombinant vaccine, which is the basis for the claim. Therefore, the quote genuinely supports the claim by substantiating the higher-dose aspect of the recombinant vaccine.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the following passage: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.'

      "original_relevance": "This quote shows that Flublok (the recombinant flu vaccine) is formulated at a higher antigen dose (135 mcg total HA per dose) compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines, which typically contain 45 mcg total HA per dose. This higher dose is a key factor in potentially inducing a more robust antibody response."
