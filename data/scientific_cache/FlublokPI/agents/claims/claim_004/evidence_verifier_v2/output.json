      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote demonstrates that the antibody response (measured by HI) to Flublok is a key immunogenicity endpoint, and that differences in HI response are used to compare vaccines. While this example is in children and shows a lower response, it establishes the context that Flublok's immunogenicity is directly compared to standard egg-based vaccines, supporting the relevance of HI as a measure for robust antibody response in other age groups."
