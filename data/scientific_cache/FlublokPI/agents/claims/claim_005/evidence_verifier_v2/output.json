It explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent was evaluated in Study 6, which enrolled subjects 50 years and older, and that the comparator was Fluarix Quadrivalent (a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine). The quote also provides the number of recipients in each group, confirming that a head-to-head comparison was made in the pivotal trial. No inference is required; the information is explicit.",

Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 - [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent / Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity (\"matching\") of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre-specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent relative to Comparator should be not less than 0).",
