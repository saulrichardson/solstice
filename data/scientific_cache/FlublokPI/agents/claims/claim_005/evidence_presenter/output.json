      "quote": "Study 6 (NCT02285998) enrolled subjects 50 years of age and older, randomized to receive Flublok Quadrivalent or Comparator (Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline) as an active control [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The safety analysis population included 4328 Flublok Quadrivalent recipients and 4344 Comparator vaccine recipients.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Study 6 (the pivotal trial) enrolled subjects 50 years and older and randomized them to receive either Flublok Quadrivalent or Fluarix Quadrivalent (a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine) as an active control. The numbers of recipients for each group are also provided. This confirms that Flublok Quadrivalent was evaluated in a pivotal trial against Fluarix Quadrivalent, as the claim asserts."

    {
      "quote": "The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 - [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent / Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity (\"matching\") of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre-specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent relative to Comparator should be not less than 10%).",
      "explanation": "The quote, together with the surrounding text, directly supports the claim. It describes Study 6 as a pivotal trial evaluating Flublok Quadrivalent against a Comparator, and the document explicitly identifies this Comparator as Fluarix Quadrivalent. The quote details the efficacy endpoint, the calculation method, and the success criterion, all in the context of this head-to-head comparison. Therefore, the quote genuinely and explicitly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine)."
