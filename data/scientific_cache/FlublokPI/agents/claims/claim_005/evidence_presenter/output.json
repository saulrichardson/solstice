The safety analysis population included 4328 Flublok Quadrivalent recipients and 4344 Comparator vaccine recipients.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It explicitly states that Flublok Quadrivalent was evaluated in Study 6, where subjects were randomized to receive either Flublok Quadrivalent or Fluarix Quadrivalent (a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine) as the active control. This confirms that the pivotal trial compared Flublok Quadrivalent against Fluarix Quadrivalent, as the claim asserts."

It explicitly states that Study 6 (the pivotal trial) evaluated Flublok Quadrivalent against Fluarix Quadrivalent (a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine), and describes the efficacy comparison between the two.
