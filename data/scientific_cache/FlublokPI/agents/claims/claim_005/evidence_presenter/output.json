The safety analysis population included 4328 Flublok Quadrivalent recipients and 4344 Comparator vaccine recipients.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok Quadrivalent was evaluated in Study 6, where subjects were randomized to receive either Flublok Quadrivalent or Fluarix Quadrivalent (a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine) as an active control. The details provided confirm that the pivotal trial compared these two vaccines, as asserted in the claim."

Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). ... Comparator in this study was Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.",

It explicitly states that Study 6 (the pivotal trial) evaluated Flublok Quadrivalent against Fluarix Quadrivalent (a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine), manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. The description of the primary efficacy endpoint and the comparator vaccine confirms that these two vaccines were evaluated against each other in the pivotal trial, as the claim asserts."

This directly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).
