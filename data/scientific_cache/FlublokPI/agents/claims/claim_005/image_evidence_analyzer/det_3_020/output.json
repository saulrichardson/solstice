  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing data from Study 1 (NCT00539981) presenting rates of culture-confirmed CDC-defined influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) and vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent versus placebo, including numbers of cases, incidence rates, percent efficacy, and 95% confidence intervals, with footnotes and abbreviations. The table only shows efficacy of Flublok Quadrivalent compared to placebo in Study 1; it does not include any data or comparator arm for Fluarix quadrivalent, therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Table focuses on Flublok versus placebo and references other studies in footnotes, but no direct comparison to Fluarix is shown.",
