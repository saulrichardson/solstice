  "explanation": "A table titled \u2018Adults 18\u201349 Years of Age, Study 1\u2019 showing case definitions (positive culture with matched strains, any ILI, etc.), with columns for Flublok (N=2344) and saline placebo (N=2304) listing number of cases, rates (%), calculated vaccine efficacy (%) and 95% confidence intervals. The table compares Flublok with saline placebo and does not include any comparison to Fluarix quadrivalent, so it does not support the claim. Note: The visible portion of the figure clearly shows only a saline placebo comparator; no mention of Fluarix is present.",
