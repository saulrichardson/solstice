  "explanation": "A table of solicited local and systemic adverse reaction rates (%) comparing Flublok (N=2272) to Placebo (N=2231), listing events such as pain, redness, swelling, headache, fatigue, etc., with columns for any, moderate, and severe reactions. This table compares Flublok against placebo, with no mention of Fluarix; therefore, it does not support the claim. Note: Only Flublok versus placebo data are shown; lack of context on Fluarix comparison limits any support for the claim.",
