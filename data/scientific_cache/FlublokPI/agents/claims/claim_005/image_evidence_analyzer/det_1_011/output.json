  "explanation": "The image shows two adjacent tables detailing solicited local and systemic adverse events. The left table presents percentages of symptoms (pain, redness, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, etc.) in Flublok and placebo groups from Study 1 (NCT00539981) and notes pooled data from three other trials comparing Flublok to a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated vaccine. The right table summarizes local and systemic reactogenicity with pooled data from studies where the comparator vaccine was Fluzone Quadrivalent. does not support the claim: the tables compare Flublok to placebo and to Fluzone Quadrivalent (and previously to trivalent vaccines), but there is no mention of Fluarix Quadrivalent as a comparator in the pivotal trial. Note: Portions of the text are cut off, but no reference to Fluarix Quadrivalent is visible.",
