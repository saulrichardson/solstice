  "explanation": "The image shows a table listing the presentation of a single-dose prefilled syringe (Carton NDC Number 49281-724-10; Components: ten 0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringes [49281-724-88]), followed by Section 16.2 Storage and Handling instructions (store refrigerated between 2\u00b0 and 8\u00b0C, do not freeze, protect syringes from light, do not use after expiration). The table only provides NDC numbers and storage/handling instructions and does not mention any clinical trial or comparison with Fluarix, so it does not support the claim Note: Image is clear but limited to packaging and storage information; no clinical trial data are present",
