  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing vaccine presentations and corresponding NDC (National Drug Code) numbers for single-dose prefilled syringes, followed by storage and handling instructions. The image only shows packaging NDC information and storage instructions; it does not contain any data or mention of a trial comparing Flublok (quadrivalent) against Fluarix (quadrivalent), and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited scope: only NDC and handling details are visible; no clinical trial information is present.",
