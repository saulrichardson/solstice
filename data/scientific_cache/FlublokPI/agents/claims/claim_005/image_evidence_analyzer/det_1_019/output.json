  "explanation": "Table showing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (%) for Flublok (N=972) versus IIV3 (N=967), with columns for any, moderate, and severe events for local reactions (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic reactions (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever). The table compares Flublok to IIV3 (a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine) and does not reference Fluarix quadrivalent, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image clearly shows comparison to IIV3 only; no mention of Fluarix or quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine is present.",
