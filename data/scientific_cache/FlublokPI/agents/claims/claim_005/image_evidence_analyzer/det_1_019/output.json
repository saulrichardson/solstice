  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular summary of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (Any, Moderate, Severe) in two groups: Flublok (N=972) and IIV3 (N=967); items listed include pain, firmness/swelling, redness, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, and fever with percentage rates for each severity category. Evidence: The comparator in the table is IIV3 (trivalent vaccine), not Fluarix quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine. The table compares Flublok to a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3), not to Fluarix quadrivalent; therefore it does not support the claim that Flublok was evaluated against Fluarix quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine. Note: Table appears complete for reactogenicity data but may not show all study comparators; based solely on visible content.",
