  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A tabular summary of solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (%) comparing Flublok (N=972) with IIV3 (N=967), listing events such as injection site pain, firmness/swelling, redness, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, and fever, with columns for any, moderate, and severe events. The table presents safety data comparing Flublok to a trivalent influenza vaccine (IIV3), not a quadrivalent Fluarix comparator; it therefore does not support the claim that Flublok was evaluated against Fluarix quadrivalent in the pivotal trial.",
