  "explanation": "A partial table showing percentages of solicited adverse events (any, moderate, severe) across unspecified study groups with footnotes referencing Studies 2 and 4 and U.S.-licensed IIV3, but lacking explicit product names or quadrivalent comparator details. The table does not support the claim because it does not explicitly show Flublok (quadrivalent) being compared against Fluarix (quadrivalent); product identities and quadrivalent comparator information are absent, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is cut off and key headers or labels identifying vaccines and quadrivalent formulations are missing, limiting determination.",
