  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (%) in two study arms: Flublok (N=972) and IIV3 (N=967). Columns list Any, Moderate, and Severe incidence for local reactions (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic reactions (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever). The table compares Flublok to IIV3 (a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine), not to Fluarix quadrivalent, and thus does not support the claim Note: The image quality is sufficient to identify labels and values, and no mention of Fluarix or a quadrivalent standard-dose comparator appears",
