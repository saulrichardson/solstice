  "explanation": "A table summarizing influenza attack rates, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) comparing Flublok quadrivalent against a comparator. The footnote specifies the comparator as the U.S.-licensed influenza vaccine Fluarix Quadrivalent. Evidence: Footnote stating 'Comparator = U.S.-licensed influenza vaccine, Fluarix Quadrivalent' The table\u2019s footnote explicitly identifies Fluarix Quadrivalent as the comparator in the pivotal trial, which supports the claim Note: Image includes only part of the table and footnotes, but the comparator identification is clear",
