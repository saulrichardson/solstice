  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) and an unnamed Comparator (N=4301) across outcomes: all rtPCR-positive influenza, influenza A, influenza B, and culture-confirmed ILI. Columns include number of cases, attack rate percentages, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI). The table shows a generic Comparator arm but does not identify that comparator as Fluarix quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine, so it does not support the claim Note: Only a portion of the figure is visible; the comparator's exact identity may be named elsewhere but is not shown here",
