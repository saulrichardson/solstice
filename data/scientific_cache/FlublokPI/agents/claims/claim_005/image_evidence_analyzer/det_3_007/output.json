  "explanation": "A table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) with a generic Comparator (N=4301) showing n, attack rates (%), relative risk, and relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE %) with 95% CI for outcomes including all rtPCR-positive influenza, influenza A, influenza B, and culture-confirmed ILI. does not support the claim because, while the table shows Flublok Quadrivalent evaluated against a comparator, the comparator is not identified as Fluarix Quadrivalent in the image. Note: The image is clear in showing a generic comparator but does not name the vaccine; context outside the image would be needed to confirm it is Fluarix.",
