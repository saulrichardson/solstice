  "explanation": "A table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) to a Comparator (N=4301), showing number of cases (n), attack rates (% and n/N) for all rtPCR-positive influenza, rtPCR-positive influenza A, rtPCR-positive influenza B, and culture-confirmed protocol-defined ILI, along with relative risk (RR) and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE %) with 95% confidence intervals. does not support the claim because although the table shows Flublok Quadrivalent versus a comparator vaccine, the comparator is not specified as Fluarix. Note: The table is legible and clearly labels the comparator generically, but it does not identify the comparator by name.",
