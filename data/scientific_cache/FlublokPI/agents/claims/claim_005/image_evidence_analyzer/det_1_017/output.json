  "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (Any, Moderate, Severe) for two vaccine groups: Flublok (N=1078) and IIV3 (N=1081). Local events include pain, redness, firmness/swelling; systemic events include fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever. The table compares Flublok to IIV3 (a trivalent inactivated vaccine), not to Fluarix quadrivalent, so it does not support the claim that Flublok was evaluated against Fluarix quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine. Note: Based solely on the visible table fragment; no mention of Fluarix or quadrivalent standard-dose comparator is present.",
