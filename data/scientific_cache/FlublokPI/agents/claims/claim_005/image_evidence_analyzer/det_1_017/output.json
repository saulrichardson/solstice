  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table presenting percentages of solicited local and systemic adverse events (Any, Moderate, Severe) for Flublok (N=1078) versus IIV3 (N=1081). Local events include pain, redness, firmness/swelling; systemic events include fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, and fever. The table compares Flublok to IIV3 (a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine) and makes no mention of Fluarix quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine; therefore it does not support the claim.",
