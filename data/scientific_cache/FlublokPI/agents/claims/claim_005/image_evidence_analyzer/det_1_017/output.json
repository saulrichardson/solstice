  "explanation": "A table presenting percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse events in adult subjects receiving Flublok (N=1078) versus IIV3 (N=1081). Columns list Any, Moderate, and Severe event rates for each vaccine. The table compares Flublok to IIV3 (a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine), with no data on Fluarix quadrivalent; therefore, it does not support the claim that Flublok quadrivalent was evaluated against Fluarix quadrivalent. Note: Image is clear and shows only a Flublok vs IIV3 comparison; no mention of Fluarix quadrivalent.",
