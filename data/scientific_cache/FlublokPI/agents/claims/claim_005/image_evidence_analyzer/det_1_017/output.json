  "explanation": "Partial view of a clinical trial table showing percentages of reported severe responses (e.g., <1%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 6%), followed by footnotes describing: results reporting conventions, inclusion of randomized subjects who provided data, and details for Studies 3 and 4 including reference to U.S.-licensed IIV3 and IIV4 vaccines and fever grading definitions. The image does not support the claim because it contains only partial safety data and footnotes for Studies 3 and 4 without naming Flublok (quadrivalent) or Fluarix (quadrivalent) or showing any direct comparison between those vaccines; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Limited by incomplete view of table; vaccine names and trial details not visible in the provided snippet.",
