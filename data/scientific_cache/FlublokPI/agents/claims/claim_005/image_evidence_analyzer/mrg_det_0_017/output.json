  "explanation": "Page 1 of Flublok quadrivalent prescribing information showing indication, dosage and administration, contraindications, warnings, and a table of contents listing section headings (e.g., Clinical Studies, Adverse Reactions) but no detailed tables or trial comparisons. does not support the claim because the image shows only general prescribing information and a contents list without any reference to Fluarix or a pivotal trial comparison between Flublok and Fluarix. Note: The image quality is sufficient, but it only contains front\u2010matter and section headings, so no clinical trial details are present.",
