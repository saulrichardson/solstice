      "quote": "Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) demonstrated efficacy against influenza strains even when the circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine, supporting the claim that recombinant technology can provide cross-protection in a mismatch season."

      "quote": "The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity (\"matching\") of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent relative to Comparator matched strains \u226520%).",

      "quote": "The efficacy of Flublok in protecting against culture confirmed influenza illness was assessed by active and passive surveillance for influenza like illness (ILI) beginning 2 weeks post vaccination until the end of the influenza season, approximately 7 months post- vaccination. ILI was defined as having at least 2 of 3 symptoms (no specified duration) in the following categories: 1) fever \u2265100\u00b0F; 2) respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, or runny nose stuffy nose); or 3) systemic symptoms (myalgias, arthralgias, headache chills sweats or tiredness malaise). For subjects with an episode of ILI nasal and throat swab sample was collected for viral culture. The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 1 was Centers for Disease Control defined influenza-like illness (CDC ILI with a positive culture for an influenza virus strain antigenically resembling a strains represented in Flublok. CDC-ILI is defined as fever of \u2265100\u00b0F oral accompanied by cough, sore throat, or both on the same day or on consecutive days. Attack rates and vaccine efficacy (VE), defined as the reduction in the influenza rate for Flublok relative to placebo, were calculated for the total vaccinated cohort (n=4648).",
