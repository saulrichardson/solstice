An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0).

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides evidence that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) showed efficacy (44.8%) against influenza strains even when 96% of circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine. This demonstrates cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim about recombinant technology leading to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection.",

      "quote": "The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity (\"matching\") of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent relative to Comparator matched strains \u2265 0).",
