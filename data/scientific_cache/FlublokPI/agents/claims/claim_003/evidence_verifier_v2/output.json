      "quote": "Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides explicit evidence that Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine) demonstrated efficacy (44.8%) against influenza strains even when 96% of circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine. This shows that the vaccine provided cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim about recombinant technology leading to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 4 of the document, in the section discussing Study 1. The text states: 'Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.",

      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies to each virus strain represented.",
      "reason": "does not support claim",

      "quote": "The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 [Attack rate Flublok Quad rival ent Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity (\"matching\") of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3 N2) viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3 N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quad rival ent relative to Comparator should be not less than 9.1%).",

      "original_explanation": "This quote describes a clinical trial in which Flublok demonstrated efficacy against influenza illness during a season when the predominant circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar to the vaccine strains, supporting the claim that recombinant technology can provide cross-protection even in a mismatch season."
