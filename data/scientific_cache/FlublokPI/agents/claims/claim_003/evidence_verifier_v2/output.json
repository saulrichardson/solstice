See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.' The numbers, facts, and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) showed 44.8% efficacy against all influenza strains, regardless of antigenic match, in a season where 96% of circulating strains were not matched to the vaccine. This is explicit evidence of cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the core of the claim. The quote does not directly address the mechanism (broader immune response), but it does provide clear, specific evidence that recombinant technology (Flublok) provided protection even when the vaccine and circulating strains did not match.",

      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies to each virus strain. Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year's influenza vaccine.",
      "reason": "does not support claim",
      "original_explanation": "This quote explains the mechanism by which recombinant technology (as used in Flublok) induces an immune response to multiple strains, and discusses the challenge of antigenic drift, providing context for why a broader immune response and potential cross-protection are important."

      "quote": "The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 - [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent / Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity (\"matching\") of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre-specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent relative to Comparator matched strains \u2265 9.7%).",

      "original_explanation": "This quote shows that Flublok Quadrivalent demonstrated efficacy during a season when the predominant circulating strain (A/H3N2) was antigenically dissimilar to the vaccine, supporting the claim that recombinant technology can provide cross-protection in mismatch seasons."
