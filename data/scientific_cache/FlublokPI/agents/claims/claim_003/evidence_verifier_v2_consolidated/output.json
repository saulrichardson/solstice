      "quote": "Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides evidence that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) demonstrated efficacy (44.8%, 95% CI 24.4, 60.0) against influenza strains even when 96% of circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine. This is explicit evidence of cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the core of the claim. The quote does not directly address the mechanism (broader immune response), but it does substantiate the outcome of cross-protection in the context of a mismatch.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 4 of the document, in the section discussing Study 1. The text states: 'Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.' This matches the quote to verify, with only minor formatting differences.",
