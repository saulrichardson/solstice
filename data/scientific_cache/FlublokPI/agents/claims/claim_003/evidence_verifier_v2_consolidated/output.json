See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.' The numbers, facts, and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) showed 44.8% efficacy against all influenza strains, regardless of antigenic match, in a season where 96% of circulating strains were not matched to the vaccine. This is explicit evidence of cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the core of the claim. The quote does not directly address the mechanism (broader immune response), but it does provide clear, specific evidence that recombinant technology (Flublok) provided protection even when the vaccine and circulating strains did not match.",

Evidence: Vaccine efficacy of 44.6% (95% CI 18.8, 62.6) against all influenza strains regardless of match to the vaccine supports the claim because the recombinant vaccine demonstrated statistically significant protection against strains not matched to the vaccine, indicating cross\u2010protection even when circulating strains may be mismatched Note: The table does not explicitly specify a mismatch season; it reports efficacy against all strains irrespective of match rather than labeling a specific mismatch period.",
