An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.",

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides evidence that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) showed efficacy (44.8%) against influenza strains even when 96% of circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine. This demonstrates cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim about recombinant technology leading to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears on page 4 of the document, in the section describing Study 1.
