      "explanation": "A table titled 'Adults 18\u201349 Years of Age, Study 1' comparing Flublok (recombinant vaccine) versus saline placebo. Columns list case definitions (positive culture with matched strains and with any strain), number of cases (n) and rates (%) for each arm, Flublok vaccine efficacy (%) and 95% confidence intervals. Evidence: Under 'Positive culture with any strain, regardless of match to the vaccine', Flublok efficacy against all strains was 44.6% (95% CI 18.8, 62.6) for CDC-ILI and 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0) for any ILI, showing protection even when strains were not vaccine-matched. The table shows Flublok, produced by recombinant technology, achieved significant efficacy against all circulating strains regardless of match, which supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and cross-protection even in mismatch seasons. Note: Data are from adults aged 18\u201349 in a single study season; some subtype CIs include zero, but overall efficacy for all strains is statistically significant.",
