  "explanation": "A table showing influenza attack rates, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE %) with 95% confidence intervals for Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant vaccine) versus a comparator vaccine. Rows include all rtPCR-positive influenza, influenza A, influenza B, and culture-confirmed protocol-defined ILI. does not support the claim because the table reports comparative efficacy (rVE) of the recombinant vaccine versus a comparator but provides no information on broader immune responses, cross-protection, or performance in a mismatch season Note: No indication in the image that the season was a mismatch or that broader immune responses were measured; limited context from a single table",
