  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a comparator vaccine (N=4301) showing the number of rtPCR-positive influenza cases, attack rates (% n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI) for all influenza, influenza A, influenza B, and all culture-confirmed protocol-defined influenza-like illness. Evidence: Data in the table report attack rates and vaccine efficacy estimates but do not demonstrate broader immune responses or cross-protection in a mismatch season. Influenza B efficacy is minimal (rVE 4%, 95% CI \u201372, 46). The table provides efficacy outcomes but does not show evidence of a broader immune response or cross-protection in mismatch conditions, so it does not support the claim. Note: Context on strain matching or mismatch season is not provided in the image; conclusions about cross-protection cannot be drawn without that information.",
