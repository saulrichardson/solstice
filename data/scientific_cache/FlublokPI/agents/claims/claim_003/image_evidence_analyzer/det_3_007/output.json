  "explanation": "Table displaying attack rates, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) with 95% confidence intervals comparing recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) to a standard inactivated quadrivalent vaccine (IIV4) across influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, mismatched B, and all strains. Evidence: For the mismatched B strain, the rVE is 4% (95% CI -72, 46), indicating no significant cross-protection. does not support the claim because the data show negligible and non-significant efficacy against the mismatched B strain, failing to demonstrate cross-protection in a mismatch season. Note: Only a portion of the table is visible and lacks full study context; confidence intervals are wide, reflecting uncertainty.",
