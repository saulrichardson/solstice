  "explanation": "A table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a comparator vaccine (N=4301) showing number of cases (n), attack rates (% n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI) for all rtPCR-positive influenza, influenza A, influenza B, and culture-confirmed protocol-defined ILI. The table presents vaccine efficacy data but does not provide any information about the breadth of the immune response or cross-protection in a mismatch season. Therefore it does not support the claim. Note: No mention of strain mismatch status or immunologic breadth; limited to efficacy endpoints only.",
