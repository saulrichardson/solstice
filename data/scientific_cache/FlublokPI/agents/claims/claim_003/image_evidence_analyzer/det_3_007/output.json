  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant vaccine) versus a comparator vaccine in a clinical trial (N\u22484,300 each), showing attack rates, relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE %) with 95% confidence intervals for all rtPCR-positive influenza, influenza A, influenza B, and culture-confirmed protocol-defined influenza-like illness. The table presents overall vaccine effectiveness and attack rates but contains no data on season mismatch, heterologous strain challenge, or measures of breadth of immune response. It does not provide direct evidence of cross-protection in a mismatch season, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but lacks any mention of mismatch seasons or immune response breadth; conclusions about cross-protection cannot be drawn from these data alone.",
