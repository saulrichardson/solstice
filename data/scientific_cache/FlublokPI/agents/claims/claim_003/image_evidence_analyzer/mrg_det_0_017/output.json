  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "Excerpt from the first page of a vaccine's prescribing information, showing the product name, indication, dosage and administration instructions, contraindications, warnings and precautions, adverse reactions, and a table of contents for the full prescribing information. The image contains prescribing information and a table of contents but no data or discussion of immune response breadth, cross-protection, or performance in mismatch seasons, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image quality is sufficient to read headings but no immunity or clinical effectiveness data are presented on this page.",
