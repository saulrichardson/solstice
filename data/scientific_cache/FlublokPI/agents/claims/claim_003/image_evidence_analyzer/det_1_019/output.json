  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A comparative table of solicited local and systemic adverse event percentages for Flublok (recombinant influenza vaccine, N=972) versus IIV3 (egg-based trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, N=967), listing rates of pain, firmness/swelling, redness, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, and fever by severity (any, moderate, severe). The table does not support the claim because it only presents safety and tolerability data, with no measurements of immune response breadth, cross-protective efficacy, or performance in mismatch seasons; therefore it does not support the claim.",
