  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing local and systemic adverse event percentages for Flublok (recombinant influenza vaccine, N=972) and IIV3 (inactivated influenza vaccine, N=967), listing incidence of pain, firmness/swelling, redness, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, and fever by severity category. The table presents only safety and adverse event data, with no information on immunogenicity, breadth of immune response, or cross-protection; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to visible content; no immunogenicity or efficacy data present.",
