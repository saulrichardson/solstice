  "explanation": "A table comparing the percentages of solicited local (pain, firmness/swelling, redness) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, fever) adverse events for two influenza vaccines: Flublok (recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine, N=972) and IIV3 (egg-based inactivated vaccine, N=967). Severity is broken down into any, moderate, and severe for each event. The table presents safety/reactogenicity data (local and systemic adverse event rates) for Flublok versus IIV3 and contains no data on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or performance in mismatch seasons, so it does not support the claim. Note: Table is clearly legible but only covers adverse event frequencies, not immunogenicity or cross-protection outcomes.",
