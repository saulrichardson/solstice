  "explanation": "A table comparing safety/reactogenicity outcomes for Flublok (N=1078) versus IIV3 (N=1081), listing percentages of local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse events (any, moderate, severe). does not support the claim because the table only presents adverse event rates, not data on immune response breadth or cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: Table content is clear but limited to safety data; no immunogenicity or cross-protection outcomes are shown.",
