  "explanation": "Table comparing solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse event rates (Any, Moderate, Severe) in recipients of two influenza vaccines: Flublok (recombinant HA vaccine, N=1078) versus IIV3 (egg-based inactivated vaccine, N=1081). The table presents only safety data (rates of local and systemic adverse events) for the two vaccines and contains no information on immune response breadth or cross-protection in a mismatch season, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited to the visible page; no immunogenicity or efficacy measures are shown in this excerpt.",
