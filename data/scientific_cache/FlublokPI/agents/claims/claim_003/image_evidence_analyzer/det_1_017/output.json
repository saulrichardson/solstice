  "explanation": "A table reporting percentages of subjects with severe responses (<1% to 6%) across studies, with footnotes describing how results are reported, study registration details for U.S.-licensed IIV3, and definitions of fever severity (mild, moderate). The table presents safety/reactogenicity data (severe response rates) and definitions of fever severity, but contains no immunogenicity or cross-protection data and therefore does not support the claim Note: Only safety data are visible; immunogenicity or cross-protection information is not shown",
