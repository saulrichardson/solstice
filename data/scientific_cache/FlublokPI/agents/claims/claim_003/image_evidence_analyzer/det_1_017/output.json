  "explanation": "A table comparing percentages of local and systemic adverse events (pain, redness, firmness/swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) for two influenza vaccines (Flublok recombinant vaccine vs IIV3) showing rates of any, moderate, and severe reactions. does not support the claim because the table presents only safety and reactogenicity data, with no immunogenicity or cross-protection results that would demonstrate a broader immune response or efficacy in a mismatch season.",
