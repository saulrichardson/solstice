  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (%) in two vaccine groups: Flublok (recombinant; N=1078) and IIV3 (inactivated; N=1081). Columns list percentages of any, moderate, and severe events for local reactions (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic reactions (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever). The table presents only safety and adverse event data, not immunogenicity or cross-protection outcomes, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis limited by the table's focus on adverse events; no immunogenicity or cross-protection data are presented.",
