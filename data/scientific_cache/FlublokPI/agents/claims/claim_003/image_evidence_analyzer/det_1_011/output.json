  "explanation": "A table comparing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (%) for Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231), listing rates of pain, redness, swelling, bruising, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, and fever by severity (any, moderate, severe). The table presents safety data (adverse event rates) and contains no immunogenicity or cross-protection results, and thus does not support the claim.",
