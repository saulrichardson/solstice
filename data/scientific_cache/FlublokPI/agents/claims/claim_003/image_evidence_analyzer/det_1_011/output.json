  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A two-column table comparing percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse events in subjects receiving Flublok (recombinant influenza vaccine, N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231), with overall, moderate, and severe event rates. The table presents safety and reactogenicity data, not immunogenicity or cross-protection results, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Limited to safety data; no information on immune response breadth or cross-protection is provided.",
