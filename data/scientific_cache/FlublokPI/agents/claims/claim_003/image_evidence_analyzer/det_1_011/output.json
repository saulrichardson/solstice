  "explanation": "A table listing percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse events in participants receiving Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231). Severity is broken down into any, moderate, and severe. The table only presents safety and tolerability data (adverse event rates) for Flublok versus placebo; it provides no information on immune response breadth, cross-protection, or performance in mismatched seasons, and therefore doesn't support the claim. Note: Analysis limited by scope of image; immunogenicity or efficacy data are not included in this table.",
