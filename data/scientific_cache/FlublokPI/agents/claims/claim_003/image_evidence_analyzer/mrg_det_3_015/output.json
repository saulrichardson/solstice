  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing a vaccine presentation (single-dose prefilled syringe), carton and component NDC numbers, followed by storage and handling instructions (refrigeration range, do not freeze, light protection, expiration guidance). does not support the claim because the table contains only product identification and storage information and provides no immunogenicity data or evidence of broader immune response or cross-protection in mismatch seasons. Note: Analysis limited by the image's focus on packaging and handling details; no clinical or immunological results are presented.",
