  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing vaccine presentation (single-dose prefilled syringe), corresponding carton and component NDC numbers, followed by storage and handling instructions (refrigeration temperature, do not freeze, protect from light, discard after expiration). The table provides only product presentation details, NDC numbers, and storage/handling guidelines; it does not contain any data or discussion about immune response breadth, cross-protection, or performance in mismatch seasons, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for the section shown; no relevant immunogenicity information is present.",
