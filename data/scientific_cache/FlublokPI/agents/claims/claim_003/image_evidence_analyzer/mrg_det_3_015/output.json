  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A table listing vaccine presentation details and National Drug Code (NDC) numbers for single-dose prefilled syringes, followed by storage and handling instructions (refrigeration temperature, do not freeze, protect from light, expiration date) and a heading for patient counseling information. The image only provides packaging information and storage/handling instructions; it does not present any immunogenicity data or discussion of immune response breadth or cross-protection and therefore doesn't support the claim. Note: The image is clear and complete for the sections shown; no related immunological data is present.",
