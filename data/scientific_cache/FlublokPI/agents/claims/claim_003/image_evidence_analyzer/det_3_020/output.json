  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",

  "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table showing vaccine efficacy data for a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Flublok) versus a licensed inactivated quadrivalent vaccine. The table is divided into endpoints: culture\u2010confirmed influenza with strains represented in the vaccine, and culture\u2010confirmed influenza with any strain regardless of match. For each endpoint it lists case counts, attack rates per 100 subjects, vaccine efficacy (VE%) and 95% confidence intervals for matched strains and for all strains. Evidence: Vaccine efficacy of 44.6% (95% CI 18.8, 62.6) against all influenza strains regardless of match to the vaccine supports the claim because the recombinant vaccine demonstrated statistically significant protection against strains not matched to the vaccine, indicating cross\u2010protection even when circulating strains may be mismatched Note: The table does not explicitly specify a mismatch season; it reports efficacy against all strains irrespective of match rather than labeling a specific mismatch period.",
