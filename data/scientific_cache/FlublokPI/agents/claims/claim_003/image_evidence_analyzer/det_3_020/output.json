  "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table of influenza vaccine efficacy in adults 18\u201349 years, Study 1, comparing Flublok (recombinant vaccine) versus saline placebo. Outcomes include culture-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) with strains matched to the vaccine and with any strain regardless of match, showing number of cases, attack rates (%) in each group, vaccine efficacy (%) and 95% confidence intervals. Evidence: Efficacy against any strain regardless of vaccine match: 44.6% (95% CI 18.8\u201362.6) for CDC-ILI all strains, and 44.8% (95% CI 24.4\u201360.0) for any ILI all strains. The table does not specifically present data from a mismatch season or directly compare breadth of immune response to other vaccine platforms; it only shows overall efficacy of Flublok against any strain. Therefore, it does not support the claim that recombinant technology leads to broader immune responses with cross-protection in a mismatch season. Note: No explicit data on mismatched seasons or direct immunogenicity endpoints; wide confidence intervals for some subtype estimates; only a placebo comparator is shown.",
