An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document on page 4, in the section describing Study 1. The wording is nearly identical, with only minor formatting differences: 'Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.' The numbers, facts, and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly supports the claim. It states that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) showed 44.8% efficacy against all influenza strains, regardless of antigenic match, in a season where 96% of circulating strains were not matched to the vaccine. This is explicit evidence of cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the core of the claim. The quote does not directly address the mechanism (broader immune response), but it does provide clear, specific evidence that recombinant technology (Flublok) provided protection even when the vaccine and circulating strains did not match."

      "explanation": "A multi\u2010row table showing vaccine efficacy data for a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Flublok) versus a licensed inactivated quadrivalent vaccine. The table is divided into endpoints: culture\u2010confirmed influenza with strains represented in the vaccine, and culture\u2010confirmed influenza with any strain regardless of match. For each endpoint it lists case counts, attack rates per 100 subjects, vaccine efficacy (VE%) and 95% confidence intervals for matched strains and for all strains. Evidence: Vaccine efficacy of 44.6% (95% CI 18.8, 62.6) against all influenza strains regardless of match to the vaccine supports the claim because the recombinant vaccine demonstrated statistically significant protection against strains not matched to the vaccine, indicating cross\u2010protection even when circulating strains may be mismatched Note: The table does not explicitly specify a mismatch season; it reports efficacy against all strains irrespective of match rather than labeling a specific mismatch period."
