    {
      "quote": "Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It provides evidence that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) showed efficacy (44.8%) against influenza strains even when 96% of circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine. This demonstrates cross-protection in a mismatch season, which is the essence of the claim about recombinant technology leading to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection."

      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) showed efficacy (44.8%) against all influenza strains, regardless of antigenic match, in subjects with influenza-like illness. This provides explicit evidence that the vaccine was effective even when the circulating strains did not match the vaccine strains, supporting the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection in a mismatch season."
