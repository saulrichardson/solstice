      "quote": "Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly provides evidence that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) demonstrated efficacy (44.8%) against influenza strains even when the majority (96%) of circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine. This supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season, as it shows efficacy in the context of antigenic mismatch."

      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the claim. It reports that Flublok demonstrated 44.8% efficacy against all influenza strains, regardless of antigenic match, in subjects with influenza-like illness. This provides explicit evidence that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) can provide protection even when the vaccine and circulating strains do not match, indicating a broader immune response and potential for cross-protection in a mismatch season."

      "explanation": "A table titled 'Adults 18\u201349 Years of Age, Study 1' comparing Flublok (recombinant vaccine) versus saline placebo. Columns list case definitions (positive culture with matched strains and with any strain), number of cases (n) and rates (%) for each arm, Flublok vaccine efficacy (%) and 95% confidence intervals. Evidence: Under 'Positive culture with any strain, regardless of match to the vaccine', Flublok efficacy against all strains was 44.6% (95% CI 18.8, 62.6) for CDC-ILI and 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0) for any ILI, showing protection even when strains were not vaccine-matched. The table shows Flublok, produced by recombinant technology, achieved significant efficacy against all circulating strains regardless of match, which supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and cross-protection even in mismatch seasons. Note: Data are from adults aged 18\u201349 in a single study season; some subtype CIs include zero, but overall efficacy for all strains is statistically significant."
