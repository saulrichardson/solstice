      "quote": "Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that Flublok (a recombinant vaccine) demonstrated efficacy against influenza strains even when the circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine, supporting the claim that recombinant technology can provide cross-protection in a mismatch season."

      "quote": "The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 6 was rtPCR-positive, protocol defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. Attack rates and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), defined as 1 [Attack rate Flublok Quadrivalent Attack Rate Comparator], were calculated for the total efficacy population (n=8604) for the primary efficacy endpoint and for several alternative efficacy endpoints (Table 5). Antigenic and phylogenetic evaluations of the similarity (\"matching\") of clinical isolates to vaccine antigens were not performed. CDC epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens during the 2014-2015 season. Study 6 met the pre specified success criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI of vaccine efficacy for Flublok Quadrivalent relative to Comparator matched strains \u226520%).",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote shows that Flublok Quadrivalent met efficacy criteria during a season when the predominant circulating influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar to the vaccine, indicating cross-protection in a mismatch season."
