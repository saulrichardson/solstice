      "quote": "Vaccine efficacy against antigenically matched culture confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliably because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained from subjects in Study 1 were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. An exploratory analysis of VE of Flublok against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting CDC-ILI criteria, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 4 for a presentation of VE by case definition and antigenic similarity.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote provides direct evidence that Flublok (a recombinant influenza vaccine) demonstrated efficacy against influenza strains even when the circulating strains were not antigenically matched to the vaccine, supporting the claim that recombinant technology can provide cross-protection in a mismatch season."

      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies to each virus strain represented.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that Flublok uses recombinant technology to produce hemagglutinin proteins from multiple influenza strains, which are designed to induce a broad immune response, supporting the mechanism by which cross-protection may occur."
