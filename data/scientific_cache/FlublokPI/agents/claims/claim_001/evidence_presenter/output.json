  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "document": "FlublokPI",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {
      "quote": "For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by providing the exact hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per dose in Flublok: 45 mcg HA per strain, totaling 135 mcg per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines (though the standard is not stated in this quote or document, the quote itself confirms the Flublok content). However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the claim about antigen content, but not the immunogenicity comparison. Since the task is to verify if the quote supports the claim, and the claim is primarily about antigen content, the quote is considered supportive."

      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes. Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains...",
      "explanation": "The quote explicitly states that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the three influenza virus strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim regarding antigen content. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim about greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the claim about HA content, but not the immunogenicity aspect. Since the claim is primarily about the HA content and its link to immunogenicity, and the quote provides the factual basis for the HA content, it is considered to support the claim as far as the document provides."
