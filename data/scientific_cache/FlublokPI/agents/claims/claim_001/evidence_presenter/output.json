  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "document": "FlublokPI",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {
      "quote": "For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by explicitly stating that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA per strain for three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, thus substantiating the '3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content' portion of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the antigen content comparison, but not the immunogenicity aspect."

For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2), and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "explanation": "The quote provides the exact HA (hemagglutinin antigen) content per dose in Flublok: 135 mcg per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg per strain for three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines (though the document does not state the standard-dose content, the quote itself gives the Flublok content as claimed). Therefore, the quote directly supports the part of the claim regarding antigen content. However, the quote does not address immunogenicity or its comparison to standard-dose vaccines; it only supports the antigen content portion of the claim."
