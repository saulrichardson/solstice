  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing attack rates (n/N and %), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE with 95% CI) comparing Flublok Quadrivalent versus a standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Fluarix) for PCR-confirmed influenza in various populations. The table provides clinical efficacy data (attack rates, RR, rVE) but contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content, so it does not support the claim about Flublok containing 3x the HA antigen linked to greater immunogenicity. Note: The image is clear and complete for efficacy data but does not address antigen quantity or immunogenicity.",
