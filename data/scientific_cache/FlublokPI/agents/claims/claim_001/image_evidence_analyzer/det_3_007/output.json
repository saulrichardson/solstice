  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing clinical outcomes (attack rates, relative risks, and relative vaccine effectiveness) of Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a comparator vaccine (N=4301) for rtPCR-positive influenza (overall, A, B) and culture-confirmed influenza-like illness in a large phase III trial. The table presents clinical effectiveness data (attack rates, RR, and rVE) but contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or direct immunogenicity measures; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: Image is clear and legible but limited to VE outcomes; no compositional or immunogenicity data are shown.",
