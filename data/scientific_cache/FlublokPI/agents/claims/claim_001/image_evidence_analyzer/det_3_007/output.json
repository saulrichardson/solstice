  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing clinical outcomes for Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a comparator vaccine (N=4301), listing number of cases, attack rates (%), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE%) with 95% confidence intervals for rtPCR-positive influenza (all, A, B) and culture-confirmed protocol-defined influenza-like illness. does not support the claim: the table provides efficacy and attack rate data but contains no information on HA antigen content or dosage comparisons between Flublok and standard-dose vaccines, nor does it link antigen content to immunogenicity. Note: Limited to visible data; image quality sufficient but no antigen content details are present.",
