  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A clinical trial results table comparing Flublok Quadrivalent (N=4303) versus a comparator vaccine (N=4301), showing the number of cases (n), attack rates (% n/N), relative risk (RR), and relative vaccine efficacy (rVE % with 95% CI) for all rtPCR-positive influenza, influenza A, influenza B, and culture-confirmed protocol-defined influenza-like illness. The image provides efficacy outcomes (attack rates, RR, and rVE) but does not present any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or its dosage relative to standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim about Flublok containing 3\u00d7 the HA antigen content linked to immunogenicity. Note: The image is clear and legible, but the absence of any antigen content data limits linking it to the claim.",
