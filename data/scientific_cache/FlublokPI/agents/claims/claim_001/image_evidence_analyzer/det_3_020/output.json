  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table summarizing influenza outcomes in adults aged 18\u201349 years from Study 1, comparing Flublok (N = 2344) against saline placebo (N = 2304). The table lists numbers and rates of culture-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) with matched and any vaccine strains, calculated vaccine efficacy percentages, and 95% confidence intervals. The table presents efficacy data comparing Flublok to saline placebo and does not provide information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparisons versus standard-dose flu vaccines; it therefore does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear and legible but only shows placebo-controlled efficacy data, not antigen content or standard-dose vaccine comparisons.",
