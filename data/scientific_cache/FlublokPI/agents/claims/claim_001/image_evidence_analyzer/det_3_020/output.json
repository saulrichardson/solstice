  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A multi-row table of vaccine efficacy results from Study 1 (NCT00539981), showing numbers of CDC-defined influenza-like illness (ILI) cases confirmed by RT-PCR culture for Flublok versus placebo across matched strains and all strains, with event rates, calculated vaccine efficacy percentages (with 95% CIs), and footnotes explaining endpoints and analytical populations. The table provides efficacy outcomes (infection rates and vaccine efficacy percentages) but does not present any information on HA antigen content or compare antigen doses between Flublok and standard-dose flu vaccines; therefore it does not support the claim. Note: None",
