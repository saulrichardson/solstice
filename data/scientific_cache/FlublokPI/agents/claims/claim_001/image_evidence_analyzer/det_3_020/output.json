  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "Table summarizing a randomized, placebo-controlled study of Flublok in adults 18\u201349 years, showing number of influenza cases, attack rates, vaccine efficacy percentages and 95% confidence intervals for various case definitions (positive culture with matched strains or any strain; CDC-ILI; any ILI), comparing Flublok (N=2344) to saline placebo (N=2304). The table does not include any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparisons to standard-dose flu vaccines, and instead reports efficacy versus saline placebo, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but only presents placebo-controlled efficacy data with no antigen dose information or head-to-head standard-dose comparator.",
