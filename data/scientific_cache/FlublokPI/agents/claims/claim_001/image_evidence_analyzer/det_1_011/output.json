  "explanation": "A table presenting solicited local and systemic adverse event percentages for Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231), listing events such as pain, redness, swelling, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, etc., with columns for any, moderate, and severe incidences. The table only reports safety/reactogenicity data for Flublok versus placebo and does not present information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity.
