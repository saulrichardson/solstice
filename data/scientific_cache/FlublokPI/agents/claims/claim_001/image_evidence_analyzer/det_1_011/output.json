  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table presenting local and systemic reactogenicity data (incidence percentages of pain, redness, firmness/swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) for Flublok versus a comparator influenza vaccine in adult clinical trials, along with footnotes on study design and denominators. The table displays safety/reactogenicity outcomes and does not include any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim. Note: Image solely contains adverse event rates; antigen dose or immunogenicity data are not shown.",
