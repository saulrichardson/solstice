  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing solicited local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse event rates (any, moderate, severe) between Flublok (N=2272) and placebo (N=2231). The table presents adverse event (reactogenicity) data for Flublok versus placebo and contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim Note: Table is clear but unrelated to antigen content or immune response",
