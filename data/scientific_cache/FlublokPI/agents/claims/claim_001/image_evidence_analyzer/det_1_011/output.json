  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing the percentages of solicited local (pain, redness, swelling, bruising) and systemic (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, chills, fever) adverse events in a randomized study comparing Flublok (N=2272) versus placebo (N=2231), with columns for any, moderate, and severe events. The table presents safety/tolerability data (adverse event rates) for Flublok versus placebo and does not include any information about hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity comparisons to standard-dose flu vaccines, and thus does not support the claim.",
