  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing solicited local and systemic adverse event rates (any, moderate, severe) for Flublok (N=972) versus IIV3 (N=967), listing percentages for pain, firmness/swelling, redness, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, shivers/chills, and fever. The table provides only adverse event rates and contains no information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity outcomes, so it does not support the claim.",
