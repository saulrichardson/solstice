  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table showing percentages of solicited adverse events (any, moderate, severe) reported by subjects in multiple studies comparing Flublok and a U.S.-licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3). Footnotes describe study populations and registration details. The table presents safety data (adverse event rates) and does not include information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity outcomes, so it does not support the claim Note: The table is cut off and focuses on safety endpoints; no antigen content or immunogenicity data are visible",
