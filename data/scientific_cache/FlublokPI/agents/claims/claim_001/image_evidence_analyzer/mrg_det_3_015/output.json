  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing the vaccine presentation (Single-Dose Prefilled Syringe), the carton NDC number (49281-724-10), and the components and NDC number (ten 0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringes [49281-724-88]), followed by storage and handling instructions. The image only shows packaging NDC numbers and storage/handling instructions and contains no information about hemagglutinin antigen content or comparisons with standard-dose flu vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: Analysis is based solely on the visible packaging and storage information; no antigen content data is present.",
