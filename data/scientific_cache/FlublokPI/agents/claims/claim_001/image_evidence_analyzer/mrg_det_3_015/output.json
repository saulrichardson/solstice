  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table listing the product presentation (single-dose prefilled syringe), its carton NDC number, and component NDC numbers, followed by storage and handling instructions (temperature, light protection, expiration). The image provides only NDC codes and storage/handling details and does not mention hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative immunogenicity, so it does not support the claim.",
