  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse event rates (% any, % moderate, % severe) for Flublok (N=1078) versus a standard-dose IIV3 vaccine (N=1081). The table only presents adverse event rates for Flublok versus IIV3 and contains no data on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity outcomes, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image clearly shows safety data but no antigen content or immunogenicity information; no issues with interpretability of these data.",
