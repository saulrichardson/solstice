  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A table comparing the percentage of solicited local (pain, redness, firmness/swelling) and systemic (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, shivers/chills, nausea, fever) adverse events of two vaccines: Flublok (N=1078) and IIV3 (N=1081), categorized by any, moderate, and severe events. The table presents safety/reactogenicity data and does not include any information on hemagglutinin antigen content or immunogenicity, and therefore does not support the claim.",
