  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "An excerpt from the Flublok prescribing information showing section headings and table of contents (e.g., Indications and Usage, Dosage and Administration, Dosage Forms and Strengths, Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions, Adverse Reactions, Use in Specific Populations, Description, Clinical Pharmacology, Nonclinical Toxicology, Clinical Studies, References, How Supplied/Storage and Handling, Patient Counseling Information). The image contains only the table of contents and section headings of the Flublok prescribing information and does not include any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparisons to standard-dose flu vaccines, so it does not support the claim.",
