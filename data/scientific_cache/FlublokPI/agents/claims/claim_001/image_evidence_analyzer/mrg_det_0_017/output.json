  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial page of Flublok prescribing information showing the table of contents (indications, dosage and administration, dosage forms and strengths, contraindications, warnings, adverse reactions, use in specific populations, etc.) and text describing Flublok as an intramuscular injection, single 0.5 mL dose. The image contains only general prescribing sections and dosage volume but no specific data on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparison to standard-dose vaccines, so it does not support the claim. Note: The image is clear but does not include any information on HA antigen amounts or immunogenicity comparisons.",
