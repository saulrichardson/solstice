  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "An excerpt from the full prescribing information for Flublok showing the table of contents with section headings (e.g., Indications and Usage, Dosage and Administration, Dosage Forms and Strengths, Clinical Studies, etc.) does not support the claim because the image only displays a table of contents without any data on hemagglutinin antigen content or comparative immunogenicity Note: Analysis limited by the fact that only the table of contents is visible; no detailed information on antigen amounts or study results is shown",
