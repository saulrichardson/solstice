      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explicitly states the total and per-strain hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content in Flublok, which is 135 mcg per dose (45 mcg per strain). This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim."
