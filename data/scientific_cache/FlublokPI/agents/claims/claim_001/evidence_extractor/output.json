      "quote": "For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote specifies that Flublok contains a total of 135 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen per dose, with 45 mcg HA from each of three strains. This is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain found in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the claim about antigen content."

      "quote": "Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies.",
      "relevance_explanation": "This quote explains that the HA proteins in Flublok serve as antigens to induce an immune response, establishing the relevance of HA content to immunogenicity."
