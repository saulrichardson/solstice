      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA per strain for three strains. This matches the claim that Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines (which typically contain 15 mcg per strain, 45 mcg total). This directly supports the first part of the claim. However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Based solely on what is explicitly stated in the document, the quote supports the claim about antigen content, but not about immunogenicity.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears in the document, specifically in the following passage: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' The wording is nearly identical, and all the key facts and numbers are preserved.",

      "original_relevance": "This quote explicitly states the total and per-strain hemagglutinin (HA) content in Flublok, which is 45 mcg per strain, totaling 135 mcg per dose. This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain (45 mcg total) found in standard-dose flu vaccines, directly supporting the first part of the claim."
