      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA per each of three influenza strains. This matches the claim that Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines (which typically contain 15 mcg HA per strain, for a total of 45 mcg per dose). While the quote does not address immunogenicity, it fully supports the portion of the claim regarding the HA content being three times that of standard-dose vaccines.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears in the document, specifically in the following passage: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.'

      "quote": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile clear colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line (expresSF+\u00ae) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum free medium composed of chemically defined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single dose syringes. Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements.",
