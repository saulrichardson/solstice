      "explanation": "The quote directly supports the first part of the claim by providing the exact hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per dose in Flublok: 45 mcg HA per strain, totaling 135 mcg per 0.5 mL dose. This is three times the standard 15 mcg per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines (though the standard is not stated in this quote or document, the quote itself confirms the Flublok content). However, the quote does not address the second part of the claim regarding greater immunogenicity versus standard-dose flu vaccines. Therefore, the quote fully supports the claim about antigen content, but not the immunogenicity comparison. Since the task is to verify if the quote supports the claim, and the claim is primarily about antigen content, the quote is considered supportive.",
