  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",

      "quote": "For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.",
      "supports_claim": true,
      "explanation": "The quote directly states that Flublok contains 135 mcg of HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA per each of three influenza strains. This matches the claim that Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines (which typically contain 15 mcg HA per strain, for a total of 45 mcg per dose). While the quote does not address immunogenicity, it fully supports the portion of the claim regarding the HA content being three times that of standard-dose vaccines.",
      "presence_explanation": "The quote appears in the document, specifically in the following passage: 'For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia 30 2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm 09 like virus) (H1 N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3 N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.' The wording and numbers are semantically equivalent to the quote provided, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, and line breaks). All technical content and facts are preserved.",

      "original_relevance": "This quote provides the exact hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content per dose in Flublok, showing it contains 45 mcg HA per strain, for a total of 135 mcg HA per dose, which is three times the standard 15 mcg HA per strain in standard-dose flu vaccines."
