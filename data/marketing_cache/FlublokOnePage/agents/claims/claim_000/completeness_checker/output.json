The quote directly states that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO, which explicitly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. The reference to 'exact antigen content' and 'identical antigenic match with WHO' is clear and does not require inference.",

This supports the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains by not introducing mutations during production.",
