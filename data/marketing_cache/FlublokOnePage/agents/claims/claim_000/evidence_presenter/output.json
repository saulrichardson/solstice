      "explanation": "The quote 'AN EXACT STRAIN MATCH 4 5 The only recombinant flu vaccine that has known and exact antigen content, Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO' appears in the document with only minor formatting differences. The factual content and meaning are preserved.. The quote directly states that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO, which explicitly supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. The reference to 'exact antigen content' and 'identical antigenic match with WHO' is clear and does not require inference."
