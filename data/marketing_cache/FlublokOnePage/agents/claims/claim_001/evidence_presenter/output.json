    {
      "quote": "AN EXACT STRAIN MATCH 4 5 The only recombinant flu vaccine that has known and exact antigen content, Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO 3 x THE ANTIGEN1-3 Flublok also contains 3 x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity 3 x",
      "explanation": "The quote appears in the document in the following passage: 'AN EXACT STRAIN MATCH 4 5 The only recombinant flu vaccine that has known and exact antigen content, Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO3 x THE ANTIGEN1-3 Flublok also contains 3 x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogen i city 3 x'. The content matches the quote, with only minor formatting and spacing differences due to OCR artifacts.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines and explicitly links this higher antigen content to greater immunogenicity. This directly supports both parts of the claim as written."
