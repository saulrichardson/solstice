  "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.",
  "supports_claim": false,
  "explanation": "A partial snippet of text from a figure, showing fragments of words such as \u2018ent of stan\u2019, \u2018en linked to\u2019, and \u2018dose flu va\u2019, with no numerical values or explicit mention of HA content. The image snippet does not support the claim because it only shows incomplete text fragments without any data or statements quantifying that Flublok contains 3\u00d7 the HA antigen content or linking that to greater immunogenicity, and therefore doesn\u2019t support the claim. Note: The image is low resolution and cut off, providing insufficient context and missing key information.",
