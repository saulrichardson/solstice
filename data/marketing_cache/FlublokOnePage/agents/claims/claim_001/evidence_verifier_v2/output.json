The content matches the quote, with only minor formatting and spacing differences due to OCR artifacts.. The quote directly states that Flublok contains 3 times the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines and explicitly links this higher antigen content to greater immunogenicity. This directly supports both parts of the claim as written.",
