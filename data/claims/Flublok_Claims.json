        {
            "claim": "Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains."
        },
        {
            "claim": "Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines."
        },
        {
            "claim": "Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness."

        {
            "claim": "Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season."
        },
        {
            "claim": "Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines."

            "claim": "Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine)."
        },
        {
            "claim": "Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)."
        },
        {
            "claim": "Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines."
        },
        {
            "claim": "Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine."
