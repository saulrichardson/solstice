"""(Deprecated) extractor interfaces.

This package previously exposed TextExtractor, TableExtractor, FigureExtractor,
and ComponentRouter, all based on heavy third-party dependencies. The
functionality has been removed from the codebase â€“ the module now exists only
to avoid import errors in downstream code while a proper migration path is put
in place.
