"""Compatibility shim that exposes the original *injestion* package under the
canonical *ingestion* name.

The codebase historically misspelled the package as ``injestion``.  To avoid
breaking downstream users we continue to ship the old import path **and** a
light-weight forwarder so that

    >>> import ingestion

gives access to the exact same module instance as

    >>> import src.injestion

The wrapper must sit at ``src/ingestion`` (rather than the project root) to be
discoverable via the default *PYTHONPATH* adjustments performed in the test
runner.
