# Installation Guide

This file will eventually contain the detailed step-by-step installation
instructions that used to live in the original README (Python version
requirements, Detectron 2 setup, Docker deployment, etc.).

For now please refer to the *Installation* section inside
[`00_project_overview.md`](00_project_overview.md#installation) which still
contains the full text.
