Insect cell-derived r HA (RIV4) has been studied extensively by
various groups in both pre-clinical models and humans. The r HA
containedin RIV4differs fromthatexpressedinother systemsin
terms of specific structural features, the nature of the source
materialandthemanufacturingprocess,whichhaveanimpacton
certain aspects of vaccine safety and efficacy (Fig. 2). Based on
these unique features, RIV4 received ‘product exclusivity’ protec-
tion from FDA, a ‘new active substance’ designation from EMA
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)48 and
an‘innovativedrug’designationfrom Health Canada 49. Theuseof
this technology, together with the molecular characterisation of
the product, should facilitate continued evolution of influenza
vaccines with improved effectivenessand theirtimely availability
