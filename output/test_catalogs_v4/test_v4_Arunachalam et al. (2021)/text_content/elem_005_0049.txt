and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against
lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against
fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that
are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine-induced
protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler
glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior
cross-clade protection compared to HA with more complex
glycans76–79. The presence of simpler glycans appears to be
equally efficient to that of chicken or mammalian cell-derived
glycosylation in ensuring the proper folding of HA, and exposes
