mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the
resultant vaccine24–26. Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg-
adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a
mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine
at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to

egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine
manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype
and several other wild-type influenza viruses in three positions,
H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. Thelowvaccineeffectiveness(41%)
observed for H3N2 in the 2012–2013 season was attributed to
these three mutations during vaccine production25. Other
