Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been
used for the manufacture of r HA vaccine antigens. The first
candidate recombinant influenza vaccines to be successfully
manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system
involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA
protein genetically fused with the Toll-like receptor 5 agonist,
Salmonella typhimurium flagellin type 229. The resultant vaccines
elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse
models 29. In Phase 1clinicalevaluation, aprototypicquadrivalent
vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune
responses in healthy adults with favourable tolerability30. The
E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high
yields of r HA (200mg/L of purified HA protein) using a minimal
numberofbioreactors31.Theauthorsprojectedthatthestrategy
could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a

will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process32.
However, E. coli-expressed r HA proteins can be subject to mis-
folding, contain impurities (e.g., host-cell proteins), and do not
undergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive proces-
sing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native
conformation31. The resulting processed proteins are less
immunogenic than egg-derived antigens, with around a 10-fold
greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in
animal models31. These inherent complications have prevented
large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of
E. coli-expressed influenza vaccines.
