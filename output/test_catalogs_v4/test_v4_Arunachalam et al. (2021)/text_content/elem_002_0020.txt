This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived
r HAthatmake RIV4uniquefromconventionalvaccines, andhow
these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably,
the benefits of this manufacturing process can be extended to
other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of
conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection
againsta constantlyevolvingand mutating virus.
