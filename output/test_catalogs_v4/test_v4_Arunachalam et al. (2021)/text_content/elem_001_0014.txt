Influenza vaccines can afford significant protection against
influenza illness, even when there is an antigenic mismatch
against the predominant circulating virus strains16,17. Such cross-
protectioncanoccurthroughtheprimingoftheimmunesystem
by vaccination or natural infection and is primarily due to
antibodies specific to conserved regions on the HA head and
stem18. Vaccines that can induce immunity specific to circulating
wild-typestrainsandcross-protectiontorelatedstrainswouldbe
ideal against constantly evolving influenza viruses. As such, the
conserved regions on the HA head and stem present attractive
targetsfor developmentof universalinfluenzavaccines19,20.
