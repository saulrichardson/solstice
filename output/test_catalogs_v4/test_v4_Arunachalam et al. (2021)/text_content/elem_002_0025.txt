Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus
acquiring egg-or cell-adaptedmutations duringthemanufactur-
ing process as it does not use ‘live’ influenza virus. Instead, DNA
coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the
Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database
andis confirmed for fidelityat theworking virus bank level28.As
such, theprimaryamino-acidsequenceofther HAproducedusing
