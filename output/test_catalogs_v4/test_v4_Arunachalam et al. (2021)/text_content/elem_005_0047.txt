RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross-reactive
antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in
humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged
65–74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high-dose split-virion
inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone® High Dose,
Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (a IIV3)82. Participant
sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell-
propagated referencevaccinestrain, twocirculatingviruses and

The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two
circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or
a IIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted
H3N2weregenerallylowandsimilaracrossallgroups,however,
receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to

the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the
cell-grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the
vaccine strains had led to loss of a glycosylation site and
