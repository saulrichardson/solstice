Several groups have explored the use of adenovirus (Ad V)
primarily as a replication-defective vector, for gene delivery and
transgeneexpressionofr HAinthehostcells. Ad Vvectorsinduce

disease39â€“41.However,pre-existingoracquiredimmunityagainst
adenovirus can hamper vaccine effectiveness by neutralising
the vaccine vector and clearing the vector-infected cells. Whil
the use of non-human adenovirus vectors could potentially
overcome this issue, Ad V vector immunity developed through
repeated immunisation (for example during repeated annua
influenza vaccinations) can dampen the immune respons
against the vaccine antigens39,40.
