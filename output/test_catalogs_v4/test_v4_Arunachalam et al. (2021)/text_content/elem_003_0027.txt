RIV4 is one of only two available influenza vaccines that are
egg-free. Like other recombinant vaccines, expression of HA in
insect cells does not depend on the generation of reassortant
candidate vaccine viruses selected for robust growth in embryo-
nated eggs or mammalian cell-lines. Instead, HA genetic
sequences from the wild-type strains selected for inclusion in

r HA are harvested and purified (Fig. 1). This process requires less
than half the time (2â€“3 months) required for the manufacture of
