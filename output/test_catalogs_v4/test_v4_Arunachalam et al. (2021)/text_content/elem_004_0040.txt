Structural analysis of the antigen-antibody complex revealed
potential dynamic state where HA undergoes structural fluctua
tions in its pre-fusion state59. A recent study by Khurana et al.6
further demonstrated, using surface plasmon resonance technol
ogy, that the observed broader specificity of antibodies induce
by RIV4 may be linked to the presence of unique epitopes o
