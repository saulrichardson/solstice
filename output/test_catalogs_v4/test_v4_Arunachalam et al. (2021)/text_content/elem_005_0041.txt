In Canada between 2000 and 2004, an unusual number of
casesofasyndrometermedasoculo-respiratorysyndrome(ORS)
were reported following immunisation with the inactivated
influenza split-virus vaccine68. Detailed analysis revealed that
ORS, induced within 2 to 24h of vaccination, was suspected to
beduetothepresenceofmicro-aggregatesofunsplitvirionsin
theconventionalegg-derivedinfluenzavaccines69.Highlevelsof
aggregate content in the split vaccine are believed to have
induced a Type-2 polarised immune response resulting in ORS
based on study results from a mouse model70. Although
extremely rare, this is unlikely to occur with RIV4 that contains
HA rosettes of small and uniform size.
