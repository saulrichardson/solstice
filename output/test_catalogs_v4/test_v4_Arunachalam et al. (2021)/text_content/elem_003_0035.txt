structures enhanced their immunogenicity, it compromised the
purity of the vaccines considerably, as VLP structures also
integrated both baculovirus and Sf9 cell proteins. Elimination of
these unwanted proteins from the vaccine required extensive
disassemblyandreassemblyprocessingofpurified VLPs, whichis
a constraint for the commercial scale manufacturing of vaccines
annually.Italso raises thecostand thetime ittakestobringthe
vaccines to the market. The yield and the cost of various
manufacturing processes and technologies are critical elements
to ensure adequate supply of vaccine at an affordable cost,
especially in a pandemic situation. This aspect of the vaccine
manufacturing has been discussed exhaustively in a report
published by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health
(PATH)and is notcovered here47.
