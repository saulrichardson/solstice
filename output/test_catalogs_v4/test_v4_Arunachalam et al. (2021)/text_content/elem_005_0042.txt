Further characterisation by cryo-electron microscopy has
revealed that the HA rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniformly
starfish-shaped;whereasinthesplitvaccinetheyaremostlynon-
symmetrical and agglomerated into huge structures, resulting in
both starfish- and peanut-shaped heterogeneous particles55.
Additional electron microscopy analysis of split vaccine clusters
