Inallconventionalinfluenzavaccines,whetherderivedfromeggs
or mammalian cells, the antigens are exposed to inactivation
agents such as formaldehyde or β-propiolactone (BPL). These

cines, RIV4 does not go through an inactivation step, thus
preserving the native HA conformation of the wild-type virus,
