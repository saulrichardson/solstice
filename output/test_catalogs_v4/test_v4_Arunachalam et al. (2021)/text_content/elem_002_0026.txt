vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have
contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness26. During the
2014–2015influenzaseason, aclade 3C.2a H3N2strainpossessing
a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged26. For the
2016–2017 season,theinfluenzavaccinewasupdated toinclude
a clade 3C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing
thenewglycosylationsite26.However,thisparticularglycosylation
site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, anti-
bodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the
glycosylated clade 3C.2a H3N2 strain26. Contrary to the egg-
derived vaccines and as expected, r HA containing the new
glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that
efficiently recognised the glycosylated clade 3C.2a H3N2 virus26.

Indeed,aspercurrentregulatoryrequirements,seedvirusesmust
be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their
