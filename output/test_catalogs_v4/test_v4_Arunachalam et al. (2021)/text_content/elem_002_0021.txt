and egg-free technologies allowing for guaranteed and faster
manufacture of influenza vaccines are needed to ensure timely
delivery for upcoming epidemic seasons and during potential
avian flu pandemics, when egg supply may be impacted. The
adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches
(including m RNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies)
in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has
demonstrated the feasibility of using more efficient methods to
producenew,effectivevaccineswithinaccelerateddevelopment
timelines.Therecombinantquadrivalentinfluenzavaccine(RIV4,
Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first
licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant
viralproteinsinsteadofantigensderivedfromliveinfluenzavirus
(as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an
unadjuvantedvaccinecontaining 45µgof HA/dosefromeachof
the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel
productionplatforminwhichrecombinant HA(r HA)isexpressed
in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system
(BEVS)22. In brief, expres SF+insect cells are infected with
recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA
genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus
polyhedrin promotor. r HA molecules from the infected cells are
extracted using detergent and purified from the clarified cell
extract using column chromatographies followed by Q mem-
brane filtration. Purified r HA is suspended in relevant buffer
using tangential flow filtration and passed through sterile
filtration for storage and formulation22. RIV4 has undergone
extensiveclinicalassessment 23, andwasfirstapprovedby FDAin
2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia,
and various other countries.
