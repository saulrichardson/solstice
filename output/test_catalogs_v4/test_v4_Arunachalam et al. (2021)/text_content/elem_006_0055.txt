As most split and subunit vaccines are prepared from influenza
virusesthataregrowninembryonatedchickeneggs,theycontain
egg proteins. Testing of 58 vaccine lots covering six different
seasonal influenza vaccines produced by five different manufac-
turers showed that the median ovalbumin concentration was
350ng/m L89. Moreover, another study of commercial influenza
vaccine preparations detected other viral proteins such as
nucleoprotein and matrix protein (confirmed by a chromato-
graphicseparation)thatarenotshowntoberelevantforvaccine
effectiveness, and viral RNA fragments (confirmed by activity
assay)90,91. Such egg-derived or other influenza virus-derived
proteins (as described above) and influenza viral RNA fragments
arenot present inrecombinant vaccines.
