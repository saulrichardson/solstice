Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes
between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to
result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the
immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff
et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically
forthe H3strain)producedusing BEVS(asusedfor RIV4), induced
significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies
against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem
domains than egg-derived split vaccines64. Recently Richards
et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy
adults who received egg-derived split vaccine, cell-derived split
vaccineor RIV4forthreesuccessiveinfluenzaseasons(2015–2016,
2016–2017, and 2017–2018)65. RIV4 elicited the most robust
responses, withsignificantlyhigher T-cellandantibodylevelsthan
