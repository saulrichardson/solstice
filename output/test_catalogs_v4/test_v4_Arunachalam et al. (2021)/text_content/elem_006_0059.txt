Inadditionto the above referenced studies,ina recent study
by Shinde et al.83 baculovirus-expressed r HA generated cross-
protective responses against both circulating and drifted
A/H3N2 strains, including in older adults who are at a higher

The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically
conservedstemregionofr HAproducedininsectcells(resulting
in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection
againstmismatchedinfluenzastrains12,75.Thestudy by Nachba-
gaeur et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant
vaccineresultsinincreasedtitreofbroadlyneutralising HAstem-
reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase
with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated
exposuretodivergentinfluenzavirusessimilartothemultiple A/
H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82. Therefore,
vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem
