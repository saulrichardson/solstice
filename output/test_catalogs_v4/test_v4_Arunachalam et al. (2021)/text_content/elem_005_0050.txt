the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in
determining HA N-glycan composition72,73. Glycoproteins
expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex-
type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells
typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated,
paucimannosidic or oligomannosidic glycans)74. An et al.72
showed that egg-derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine
kidney)cell-derived HApredominantlycontainedhighly-branched
complex or high-mannose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9
insectcells had relativelysmallpaucimannose glycans (Fig. 2)72.
