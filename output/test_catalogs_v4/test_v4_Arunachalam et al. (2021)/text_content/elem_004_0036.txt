The conformational differences between pre-fusion and post-
fusion states of HA and the process of exposure of the fusion
peptide have been well described54. Webster et al.57 demon-
strated, using monoclonal antibodies, that neutralising epitopes

Similarly, several broadly neutralising antibodies directed against
the highly conserved HA stem region have been shown to block
