given at 15 µg dose/strain in adults aged 18 to 64 years .
However, inconsistency in the expression levels of target proteins,
due to nonspeciﬁc integration of transgene(s) into the host
genome, has been a major challenge with plant-based expression
34
systems . The unpredictable yield could adversely impact timely
vaccine production, which typically involves updating at least one
HA component of the vaccine to reﬂect antigenic change in
the circulating inﬂuenza viruses each season. A unique positive
attribute of plant-derived rHA is that it can stimulate innate
immunity that predominantly facilitates Type 1 pro-inﬂammatory
cellular immune responses, potentially as a direct effect of the
38
plant-origin lipids/glycolipids in the vaccine formulation . These
stimulatory components in a plant-derived vaccine may need to
be controlled and kept at a constant level, for commercialisation,
to avoid potential severe adverse events caused by enhanced
immune responses in vaccinees.
Several groups have explored the use of adenovirus (AdV),
