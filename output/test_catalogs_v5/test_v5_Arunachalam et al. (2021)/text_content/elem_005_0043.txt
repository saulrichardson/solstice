THE HOMOGENEITY OF RECOMBINANT HA ANTIGENS IN RIV4
MAY IMPROVE THE SAFETY PROFILE OVER CONVENTIONAL
INFLUENZA VACCINES
As described above, HA is expressed on the viral surface as a HA
trimer (rosette). When these are extracted from inﬂuenza viruses
they form clusters of varying sizes. This has been observed in
conventional inﬂuenza virus-derived vaccines, with estimates of 18
55,66,67
to 1100 trimers per cluster . Two distinct populations of
cluster have been observed; the majority have an average diameter
