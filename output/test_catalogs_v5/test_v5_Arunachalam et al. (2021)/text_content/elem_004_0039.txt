Fig. 2 Structural features of native HA expressed on inﬂuenza virus and rHA produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression
vector system. a HA protein (shown as monomer) extracted from inﬂuenza virus is a heterodimer comprising HA1 (turquoise) and HA2
(orange) linked though an inter-disulﬁde (S–S) bond and contains complex-type sialylated N-linked glycans. Cleaved fusion peptides (green)
74
and complex glycans eliminate and mask unique epitopes on HA respectively. b Recombinant HA protein (shown as monomer) expressed in
insect cells as a single precursor polypeptide (HA0) with amino acid sequence identical to wildtype HA sequence and contains unsialylated
74
paucimannosidic N-linked glycans . HA0 is coloured in turquoise and orange to show HA1 and HA2 segments combined as a single
