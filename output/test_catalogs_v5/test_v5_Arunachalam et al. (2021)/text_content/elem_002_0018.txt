adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches
(including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies)
in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has
demonstrated the feasibility of using more efﬁcient methods to
produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development
timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (RIV4,
® ®
Flublok , Supemtek [EU, Canada], Sanoﬁ Pasteur) was the ﬁrst
licensed inﬂuenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant
viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live inﬂuenza virus
(as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an
unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of
the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel
production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed
in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system
(BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with
recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant inﬂuenza HA
genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus
polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are
extracted using detergent and puriﬁed from the clariﬁed cell
extract using column chromatographies followed by Q mem-
brane ﬁltration. Puriﬁed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer
using tangential ﬂow ﬁltration and passed through sterile
