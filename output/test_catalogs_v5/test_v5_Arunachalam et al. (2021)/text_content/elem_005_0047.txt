THE N-LINKED GLYCAN STRUCTURE OF RECOMBINANT HA
PRODUCED IN INSECT CELLS DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM
HA IN OTHER INFLUENZA VACCINES
Inï¬‚uenza HA has a variable number of N-linked glycosylation sites
(depending on the virus strain and subtype) in the globular head
71
region and the conserved stem region . The glycosylation of HA
has various functions, including regulation of the virus life-cycle
71
and a role in disease pathogenesis . During vaccine manufacture,
the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in
72,73
determining HA N-glycan composition . Glycoproteins
expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex-
type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells
typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated,
74 72
paucimannosidic or oligomannosidic glycans) . An et al.
showed that egg-derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine
kidney) cell-derived HA predominantly contained highly-branched
complex or high-mannose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9
72
insect cells had relatively small paucimannose glycans (Fig. 2) .
