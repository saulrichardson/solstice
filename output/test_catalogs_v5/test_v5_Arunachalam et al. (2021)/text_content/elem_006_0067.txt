or mammalian cells, split with detergents with or without further HA
enrichment. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates
the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary
HA structure through egg- or cell-adaptation. We also describe
features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible
for the generation of broad cross-reactive and protective antibodies,
together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The
homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process-related
impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses
the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs,
related process-impurities such as inactivating agents or residual
egg-protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these
impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well-
established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could
be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where
cross-protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such
as pandemic inﬂuenza and/or COVID-19.
