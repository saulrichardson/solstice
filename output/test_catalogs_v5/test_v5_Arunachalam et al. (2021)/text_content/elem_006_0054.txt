A/H3N2 strains, including in older adults who are at a higher
risk for inﬂuenza and associated medical complications83,84. This
unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related
to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved.
The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically
conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting
in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection
against mismatched inﬂuenza strains12,75. The study by Nachba-

gaeur et al. supports the hypothesis that a recombinant
