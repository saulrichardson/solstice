E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high
yields of rHA (200 mg/L of puriﬁed HA protein) using a minimal
31
number of bioreactors . The authors projected that the strategy
could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a
31
medium-scale pharmaceutical production facility . This approach
32
will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process .
However, E. coli-expressed rHA proteins can be subject to mis-
folding, contain impurities (e.g., host-cell proteins), and do not
33
undergo glycosylation . They therefore need extensive proces-
sing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native
31
conformation . The resulting processed proteins are less
immunogenic than egg-derived antigens, with around a 10-fold
greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in
31
animal models . These inherent complications have prevented
large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of
E. coli-expressed inﬂuenza vaccines.
Vaccines containing plant-derived rHA either in soluble form or
in virus-like particles (VLPs) have been shown to be safe and
34–37
immunogenic in humans . A plant-derived recombinant
quadrivalent VLP (QVLP) at 30 µg dose per strain was found to
be non-inferior in terms of vaccine efﬁcacy against respiratory
