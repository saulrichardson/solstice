POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE
VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE
MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE
A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential
for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire
adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or
mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive
mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the
24–26 24
resultant vaccine . Raymond et al. showed that an egg-
adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a
mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine
at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speciﬁc to
receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferen-
tially over the circulating wild-type virus24. During the 2012–2013
northern hemisphere inﬂuenza vaccination campaign, HA from an
egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine
manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype
and several other wild-type inﬂuenza viruses in three positions,
25
H156Q, G186V, and S219Y . The low vaccine effectiveness (41%)
observed for H3N2 in the 2012–2013 season was attributed to
25
these three mutations during vaccine production . Other
antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine
strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have
contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in
other inﬂuenza seasons26,27.
Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for
H3N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when
the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to
27
circulating strains . Differences in HA glycosylation between the
