350 ng/mL89. Moreover, another study of commercial inﬂuenza
vaccine preparations detected other viral proteins such as
nucleoprotein and matrix protein (conﬁrmed by a chromato-
graphic separation) that are not shown to be relevant for vaccine
effectiveness, and viral RNA fragments (conﬁrmed by activity
assay)90,91. Such egg-derived or other inﬂuenza virus-derived
proteins (as described above) and inﬂuenza viral RNA fragments
are not present in recombinant vaccines.
Although uncommon, some individuals may be at increased
risk of hypersensitivity reactions to component proteins such as
ovalbumin and those who are sensitised may be at higher risk of
92
clinical manifestations of allergic disease upon exposure . Egg
protein, viral RNA, and process impurities such as inactivating
agents or hydrocortisone that are typically present in conven-
tional vaccines are absent in RIV4 would eliminate potential
adverse reactions, although rare, to these components in
93
vulnerable individuals .
