The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly
conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions
could provide broader speciﬁcity. Antisera raised against simple
monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth
and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect agains
lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised agains
75
fully glycosylated HA . Thus, elimination of parts of glycans tha
are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine-induced
protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simple
glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superio
cross-clade protection compared to HA with more complex
76–79
glycans . The presence of simpler glycans appears to be
equally efﬁcient to that of chicken or mammalian cell-derived
glycosylation in ensuring the proper folding of HA, and exposes
conserved regions of the molecule for the induction of immunity
