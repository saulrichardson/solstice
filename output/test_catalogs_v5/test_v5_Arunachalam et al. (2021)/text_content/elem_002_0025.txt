RECOMBINANT HA EXPRESSION SYSTEMS
Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been
used for the manufacture of rHA vaccine antigens. The ﬁrst
candidate recombinant inﬂuenza vaccines to be successfully
manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system
involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA
protein genetically fused with the Toll-like receptor 5 agonist,
Salmonella typhimurium ﬂagellin type 229. The resultant vaccines
elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse
29
models . In Phase 1 clinical evaluation, a prototypic quadrivalent
vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune
30
responses in healthy adults with favourable tolerability . The
