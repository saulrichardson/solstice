a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing

the new glycosylation site . However, this particular glycosylation
site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, anti-
bodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the
26
glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain . Contrary to the egg-
derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new
glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that
efﬁciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus26.
The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the
adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are
low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus.
Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must
be conﬁrmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their
originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine
production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate
seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.
Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus
acquiring egg- or cell-adapted mutations during the manufactur-
ing process as it does not use ‘live’ inﬂuenza virus. Instead, DNA
coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the
Global Initiative on Sharing All Inﬂuenza Data (GISAID) database
and is conﬁrmed for ﬁdelity at the working virus bank level28. As
such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using
baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to
the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal
inﬂuenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch
of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wildtype
