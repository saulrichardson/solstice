RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross-reactive
antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in
82
humans. In a small study by Belongia et al. , participants aged
65–74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high-dose split-virion
®
inactivated trivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (Fluzone High Dose,
Sanoﬁ Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant
sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell-
propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and
an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift.
The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two
circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or
aIIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted
H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however,
receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to
this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although
