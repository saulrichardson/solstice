for the release and the stability of RIV4.
Further characterisation by cryo-electron microscopy has
revealed that the HA rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniformly
starﬁsh-shaped; whereas in the split vaccine they are mostly non-
symmetrical and agglomerated into huge structures, resulting in
both starﬁsh- and peanut-shaped heterogeneous particles55.
Additional electron microscopy analysis of split vaccine clusters
showed a highly heterogeneous mixture containing different
types of viral particles containing HA and NA as well as split viral
membrane folded in various shapes, slightly disrupted virions, and
66
whole virions .
In Canada between 2000 and 2004, an unusual number of
cases of a syndrome termed as oculo-respiratory syndrome (ORS)
were reported following immunisation with the inactivated
inﬂuenza split-virus vaccine68. Detailed analysis revealed that
ORS, induced within 2 to 24 h of vaccination, was suspected to
be due to the presence of micro-aggregates of unsplit virions in
the conventional egg-derived inﬂuenza vaccines69. High levels of
aggregate content in the split vaccine are believed to have
