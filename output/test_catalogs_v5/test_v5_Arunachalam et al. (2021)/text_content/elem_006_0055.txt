vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem-
reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase
78
with age . This increase with age is possibly due to repeated
exposure to divergent inﬂuenza viruses similar to the multiple A/
82
H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al. . Therefore,
vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem
can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater
breadth of protection against inﬂuenza.
