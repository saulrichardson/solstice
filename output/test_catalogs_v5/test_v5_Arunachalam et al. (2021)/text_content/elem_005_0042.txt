et al. examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy
adults who received egg-derived split vaccine, cell-derived split
vaccine or RIV4 for three successive inﬂuenza seasons (2015–2016,
2016–2017, and 2017–2018)65. RIV4 elicited the most robust
responses, with signiﬁcantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than
the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosyla-
tion of rHA and absence of other inﬂuenza viral proteins in RIV4
contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and
emphasised the relevance of these features in determining
