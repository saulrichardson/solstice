clearly demonstrate structural differences between HA pre-fusion
and post-fusion states, and the presence of unique neutralising
epitopes in the pre-fusion HA0 molecules, which are present in
RIV4 (Fig. 2).
Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes
between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to
result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the
immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff
et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (speciﬁcally
for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced
signiﬁcantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies
against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem
