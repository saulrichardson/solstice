In a study by Nachbagauer et al. , RIV4 induced HA stem-
speciﬁc neutralising antibodies directed against inﬂuenza subtypes
H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age-dependent manner in
78
humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly . RIV4 also
induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are speciﬁc to
epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a
®
traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax
77
[Trivalent]) . Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory
antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4
compared to egg- or mammalian cell-derived split vaccines
® ®
(Flucelvax Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone quadrivalent SD, Sanoﬁ
60
Pasteur) . These data warrant additional studies to verify whether
rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional
vaccines and whether this underlies the cross-protection against
12,81
antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials .
