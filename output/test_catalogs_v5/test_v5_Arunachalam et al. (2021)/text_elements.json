Such adaptive\nmutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the\n24\u201326 24\nresultant vaccine . Raymond et al. showed that an egg-\nadapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a\nmutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine\nat position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speci\ufb01c to\nreceptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferen-\ntially over the circulating wild-type virus24. During the 2012\u20132013\nnorthern hemisphere in\ufb02uenza vaccination campaign, HA from an\negg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine\nmanufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype\nand several other wild-type in\ufb02uenza viruses in three positions,\n25\nH156Q, G186V, and S219Y . The low vaccine effectiveness (41%)\nobserved for H3N2 in the 2012\u20132013 season was attributed to\n25\nthese three mutations during vaccine production .
