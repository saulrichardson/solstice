Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes
etween recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to
esult in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the
mmune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff
t al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically
ortheH3strain)producedusingBEVS(asusedforRIV4),induced
ignificantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies
gainst highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem
omains than egg-derived split vaccines64. Recently Richards
t al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy
dults who received egg-derived split vaccine, cell-derived split
