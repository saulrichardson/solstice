owever, E. coli-expressed rHA proteins can be subject to mis
olding, contain impurities (e.g., host-cell proteins), and do no
ndergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive proces
ing to attain desired purity and to fold to their nativ
onformation31. The resulting processed proteins are less
mmunogenic than egg-derived antigens, with around a 10-fold
reater quantity needed to generate protective immunity i
nimal models31. These inherent complications have prevented
arge scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation o
