together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The
homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process-related
impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses
the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs,
related process-impurities such as inactivating agents or residual
egg-protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these
impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well-
established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could
