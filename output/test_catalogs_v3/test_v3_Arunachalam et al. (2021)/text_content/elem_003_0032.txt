In uenza HA is synthesised as a single precursor polypeptide

other subtilisin family endoproteases after newly synthesised
virions are released from infected cells50,51. HA cleavage is
essential for the infectivity of influenza virus. Thus, expression of
these proteases exclusively in the respiratory tract is responsible
for influenza virus tropism to epithelial cells of the upper and
lower respiratory tract. However, HA from influenza subtypes H5
