Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the viru
acquiring egg-or cell-adaptedmutations duringthemanufactur
ing process as it does not use ‘live’ influenza virus. Instead, DN
coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in th
Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) databas
