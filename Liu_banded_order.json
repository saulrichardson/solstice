In this randomized trial (Clinicaltrials.gov:\nNCT03722589), sera pre- and post-vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated\negg-based (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) in\ufb02uenza\nvaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018\u221219\n(N = 723) and 2019\u221220 (N = 684) in\ufb02uenza seasons. We performed an\nexploratory analysis. Vaccine egg-adapted changes had the most impact on\nA(H3N2) immunogenicity. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total\nHA head binding antibodies to cell- A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year\n2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-\nccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with\neither RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating\nviruses with decreased neutralizing antibody egg/cell ratio. RIV4 also had\nhigher post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in\nyear 1, but there was no signi\ufb01cant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise\namong vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2.

Those comparisons were focused on the neu-\ntralizing antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses only.\nRIV4 elicited higher neutralizing antibody responses than IIV4 against\ncell-propagated vaccine viruses27. Repeat vaccination with ccIIV4 or\nRIV4 in 2 seasons also resulted in signi\ufb01cantly higher post-vaccination\nantibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses29.

The imprinting effect of egg-based vac-\ncines could be lifelong resulting in a persistence of antibodies targeting\negg-adapted sites that could be preferentially reinforced following\nrepeat egg-based vaccination3.

Our study suggests that non-egg-based vaccines, especially RIV4,\nmight circumvent the effect of repeat vaccination with egg-based\nin\ufb02uenza vaccines that contain egg-adapted changes.\nRepeat vaccination can lead to reduced VE23,32,33. In year 1, the\nfrequent prior repeat egg-based vaccinations may blunt the antibody\nresponses to the subsequent vaccination as re\ufb02ected by the limited\nfold rise in MN/HI antibody titers (Fig. 3).

However, for\nA(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses, the difference in HI antibody versus the\ntotal HA head binding antibody levels among 4 vaccine groups was less\nconsistent, suggesting that the magnitude of improvement differ\nbetween subtypes and were likely determined by the relative immu-\nnodominance of the egg-adapted HA epitopes for each subtype. In\naddition, the egg/cell HA head binding ELISA titer ratios were around 1\nfor all vaccine antigen subtypes irrespective of vaccine platforms\n(Fig. 4B), suggesting the total HA binding antibody responses induced\nby vaccination cannot differentiate egg-adapted epitopes on HA even\nfor A(H3N2). This is in stark contrast to the highly elevated egg/cell\nGMT ratio in neutralizing antibody responses to egg- vs cell-A(H3N2)\nviruses (Fig. 5A, B), highlighting the importance of inducing high\nquality, neutralizing antibody responses from vaccination.\nOur study also demonstrated that the impact of vaccine egg-\nadaption may differ between in\ufb02uenza virus subtypes, with the biggest\nimpact on neutralizing antibodies to A(H3N2) and moderate impact for\nin\ufb02uenza B vaccine viruses.
