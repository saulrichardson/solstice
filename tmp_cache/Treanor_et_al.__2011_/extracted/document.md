### Although
 embryonated
 hen’s
 eggs
 have
 been
 used
 to
 generate
effective
 inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 for
 many
 years,
 this
 system
 does
 have
several
 important
 drawbacks.
 Vaccine
 manufacturing
 using
 eggs
requires specialized facilities and the ability to scale up egg pro-
growth
 in
 eggs,
 a
 process
 that
 can
 be
 time
 consuming,
 is
 not
 always
successful,
 and
 which
 can
 select
 receptor
 variants
 that
 may
 not
 be
optimally
 representative
 of
 circulating
 inﬂuenza
 strains

Background:
 Development
 of inﬂuenza
 vaccines
 that  do  not  use  embryonated
 eggs  as  the substrate
 for
vaccine
 production
 is  a high  priority.
 We  conducted
 this  study
 to determine
 the  protective
 efﬁcacy
 a
recombinant,
 baculovirus-expressed
 seasonal
 trivalent
 inﬂuenza
 virus  hemagglutinin
 (rHA0)
 vaccine
(FluBlok®).
Methods:
 Healthy
 adult  subjects
 at 24  centers
 across
 the  US
 were  randomly
 assigned
 to  receive  a single
injection
 of saline  placebo
 (2304  subjects),
 or trivalent
 FluBlok
 containing
 45  mcg  of  each
 rHA0  component
(2344
 subjects).
 Serum  samples
 for  assessment
 of  immune
 responses
 by  hemagglutination-inhibition
(HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization Subjects were followed

 similar
 to
 those
 seen
 with
 egg-derived
ﬂuenza
 vaccines.
 Finally,
 in
 a
 preliminary
 ﬁeld
 efﬁcacy
 eval-
ation,
 recipients
 of
 the
 rHA0
 vaccine
 had
 reduced
 rates
 of
ulture-positive

 compared
 with
acebo

 although
 the

 [9].
In
 the
 present
 study,
 we
 performed
 a
 much

 assessment
 the
 immunogenicity,
 safety,
 and
 protective
 efﬁcacy
 of
 the

 egg-grown

 in
 healthy

 using
 a
 placebo-controlled

 during

 in

 the
verall

 of

 inactivated
 vaccine
 against

onﬁrmed
 illness
 was
 63%,
 and
 the
 lower
 95%
 CI
 was
 46.7%
 [18].
 The
redominant

 A
 isolates
 in
 that
 study
 were
 H1N1
 viruses,

Consistent
 with
 the
 results
 of
 national
 surveillance
 in
 the
 US
uring
 the
 2007–2008
 season
 [17], the
 majority
 of
 inﬂuenza
 A
ruses
 detected
 in
 this
 study
 were
 H3N2
 viruses
 that
 represented
substantial
 antigenic
 mismatch
 with
 the
 vaccine.
 However,
 even
nder
 these
 circumstances,
 FluBlok
 had
 signiﬁcant
 protective
 efﬁ-
acy
 against
 culture-conﬁrmed

 illness,
 including
 those

 viruses
 isolated
 in

 elsewhere
 in

 America
 during

eason
 belonged
 to
 the

 B
 viruses,
gainst
 which
 vaccines
 representing
 the
 Victoria
 lineage
 would
 be
xpected
 to
 have
 little
 or
 no
 efﬁcacy.
 We  also
 found
 that
 the

 is
 unclear.

Although
 we
 did
 not

 to

 by
view
 of
 medical
 records,
 signiﬁcant
 differences
 in
 both
 the
 fre-

 were
 shown
 when
