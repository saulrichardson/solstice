### year 1, but there was no signiﬁcant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise
among vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2. Multiple seasons of non-eg
based vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from
immune memory to egg-adapted epitopes and re-focus the immune respons
towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectivenes

Repeat vaccination with egg-based inﬂuenza vaccines could preferentially
boost antibodies targeting the egg-adapted epitopes and reduce immuno-
genicity to circulating viruses. In this randomized trial (Clinicaltrials.gov:
NCT03722589), sera pre- and post-vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated
egg-based (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) inﬂuenza
vaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018−19
(N = 723) and 2019−20 (N = 684) inﬂuenza seasons We performed an

Antibody responses to egg-adapted epitopes measured by
antibody GMT egg/cell titer ratio in year 1
To assess the levels of antibody responses targeting the egg-adapted
epitopes, we used the antibody “GMT egg/cell titer ratio” as a proxy to
quantify the extent of difference in antibody responses to egg- versus

year 1, a total of 26 breakthrough infection cases were identiﬁed with

Pre-existing A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk antibodies
were detected in participants at varies levels. Comparing HA stalk
antibody titers at 1-month post-vaccination versus day 0, vaccination
signiﬁcantly boosted A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk antibodies in all 4 vac
cine groups (p < 0.01), and signiﬁcantly boosted A(H3N2) HA stalk
antibodies in 3 of the 4 vaccine groups (p < 0.001, Fluzone IIV4, ccIIV4
and RIV4) (Fig. 4C). The RIV4 group had the highest A(H1N1)pdm09 HA
stalk and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies at 1-month post-vaccination
however the fold rises of HA stalk antibodies were low (<1.8) and
similar among all 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 4D). At 6-months post-vacci
nation, waning of HA stalk antibodies were more notable in ccIIV4 and

(n = 98)) age groups respectively (A, B). Antibody waning was expressed as the GM
fold-reduction of titers from 1-month to 6-months (1 m/6 m) post-vaccination for

Next, to assess whether vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines
can overcome the impact of egg-adaptation and reduce the GMT egg/

participants with egg/cell ratio ≥4” in MN/HI titers at pre- and 1-month

Statistical analyses
Geometric mean titers (GMTs) at day 0, 1-month and 6-months, geo-
metric mean fold rise (GMFR) of antibody titers at 1-month versus day
0, and geometric mean fold reduction of antibody titers at 6 months
versus 1-month were calculated per vaccine group. “GMT egg/cell titer
ratio” (ratio = GMT to egg-grown vaccine virus or rHA/GMT to cell-
grown vaccine virus or rHA) was calculated to quantify the difference
in antibody response to egg- versus corresponding cell-propagated
vaccine virus for each vaccine group. The proportion of participants

(HRP) conjugated goat anti human pan immunoglobulin conjugate to
detect total binding antibodies. ELISA was performed based on pre-
viously described procedures46,47. The ELISA titers were determined as
the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum samples that achieved an
optical density (OD) value of 0.2 or greater.
Sequence analyses
All the testing viruses used in this study were sequenced. Sequences
were analyzed against the sequences of candidate vaccine viruses (CVV)
of the study vaccines as deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian
Inﬂuenza Data (GISAID) database by BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 (Table 1).

0019/2016 viruses were tested in MN assays in year 1 using MDCK-SIAT1
cells using methods as previously described44. In Year 2, egg- and cell-
propagated A/Kansas/14/2017 viruses were tested by HI assays using
0.75% guinea pig erythrocytes in the presence of 20 nM oseltamivir.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Twenty percent of participants were selected by random sampling from
each vaccine group and age strata (18−44 yrs and 45−64 yrs) in year 1
(n = 144) and year 2 (n = 140), the MN/HI antibody levels of the subset are
representative of the whole study populations in year 1 (Fig. S3) and year
2 (Fig. S4). These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the
total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from
both egg-and cell-propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens),
and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk, and A(H3N2) HA
stalk). rHA from egg- and cell A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09, rHA
head from egg- and cell- A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2), B/
Colorado/06/2017 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata)
were tested with year 1 sera; rHA from egg- A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)
pdm09 and cell-A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1N1)pdm09, rHA head from egg- and

were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established
procedures45. For ELISA, rHA antigens were coated at 100 ng/well. Serum
samples were tested at an initial dilution of 1:400 followed by 2-fold

### vaccine e

with MN or HI GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4 fold was calculated to
quantify the percent of participants with antibodies predominantly
targeting egg-adapted epitopes per vaccine group. One-way ANOVA
corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s test) or nonparametric
Kruskal-Wallis test was used for multiple group comparison, two-tailed
paired t test was used to compare pre- and post-vaccination; two-tailed
unpaired t test was used to compare the post-vaccination titers
between IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm and each of the remaining 6 arms in
Year 2; Two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used for comparing pro-
portions. P < 0.05 is considered statistically signiﬁcant. SAS 9.4 (SAS
Institute) and GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) were used
for statistical analyses.
Ethic review
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review boards (IRBs) of the study sites and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Informed consent was obtained from the par-
ticipants. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03722589.
